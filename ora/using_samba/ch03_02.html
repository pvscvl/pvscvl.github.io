However, you cannot edit either name here (as you could in Windows 95/98), but instead must use the Change button below the two text fields.

The name you set here is the NetBIOS name. You're allowed to make it different from the TCP/IP hostname, but doing so is usually not a good thing. Don't worry that Windows NT forces the computer name and the workgroup to be all capital letters; it's smart enough to figure out what you mean when it connects to the network.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="sect3">

Figure 3.23: The DNS panel</A></H4><IMG ALT="Figure 3.23" CLASS="graphic" SRC="figs/sam.0323.gif"><P CLASS="para">
The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating human-readable computer names such as <EM CLASS="emphasis">
atrish.example.com</EM> into IP addresses such as 192.168.236.10. There are two ways to accomplish this on a NT machine. First, you can specify a DNS server to do the translation for you, or you can keep a local list of name/address pairs for your workstation to refer to.</P><P CLASS="para">
For a LAN that's not on the Internet, the list of possible hosts is typically small and well known, and may be kept in a file locally. Networks that are connected to the Internet typically use DNS service since it isn't possible to guess ahead of time what addresses you might be accessing out on the net. If you are in doubt as to whether a DNS server is being used, or what its address might be, look at the file <EM CLASS="emphasis">
/etc/resolv.conf</EM> on your Samba server: any machine using DNS will have this file. It looks like the following:</P><PRE CLASS="programlisting">
&#13;#resolv.conf 
domain example.com 
nameserver 127.0.0.1 
nameserver 192.168.236.20</PRE><P CLASS="para">
In this example, the first nameserver in the list is 127.0.0.1, which indicates that the Samba server is also a DNS server for this LAN.[<A HREF="#ch03-pgfId-946587" CLASS="footnote">
3</A>] In that case, you would use its network IP address (not 127.0.0.1, its localhost address) when filling in the DNS Configuration dialog box. Otherwise, use the other addresses you find in the lines beginning with <CODE CLASS="literal">
nameserver</CODE>. Try to select ones on your own network. Any name servers listed in <EM CLASS="emphasis">
/etc/resolv.conf</EM> should work, but you'll get better performance by using a server nearby.</P><BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="footnote">
<DIV CLASS="footnote">
<P CLASS="para">
<A NAME="ch03-pgfId-946587" CLASS="footnote">
[3]</A> The address 127.0.0.1 is known as the <EM CLASS="emphasis">

ping 127.0.0.1</CODE> on a Unix server, you should always get a response, as you're pinging the host itself.</P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE><P CLASS="para">
Finally, enter the machine name once more, making sure that it's the same one listed in the Identification tab of the Network dialog box (before the NetBIOS name). Also, enter the DNS domain on which this machine resides. For example, if your workstation has a domain name such as <EM CLASS="emphasis">
example.com</EM>, enter it here. You can safely ignore the other options.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="sect3">

3.2.2.3 WINS Address tab</A></H4><P CLASS="para">If you are not using a DNS server, you still need a way of translating NetBIOS names to addresses and back again. We recommend that you configure both DNS and WINS; NT has a preference for WINS and WINS can use DNS as a fallback if  it cannot resolve any machine address. The WINS Address tab is shown in <A HREF="#ch03-20855" CLASS="xref">
Figure 3.24</A>. </P><H4 CLASS="figure">
<A NAME="ch03-20855" CLASS="title">
Figure 3.24: The WINS Address tab</A></H4><IMG ALT="Figure 3.24" CLASS="graphic" SRC="figs/sam.0324.gif"><P CLASS="para">
If you have a WINS server, enter its address in the space marked Primary WINS Server. If your Samba server is providing WINS service (in other words, you have the line <CODE CLASS="literal">
wins</CODE> <CODE CLASS="literal">
service</CODE> <CODE CLASS="literal">
=</CODE> <CODE CLASS="literal">
yes</CODE> in the <EM CLASS="emphasis">
smb.conf</EM> file of your Samba server), provide the Samba server's IP address here. Otherwise, provide the address of another WINS server on your network.</P><P CLASS="para">
You probably noticed that there is a field here for the adaptor; this field must specify the Ethernet adaptor that you're running TCP/IP on so that WINS will provide name service on the correct network. If you have both a LAN and a dialup adaptor, make sure you have the LAN's adaptor here.</P><P CLASS="para">
Finally, select the "Enable DNS for Windows Resolution" checkbox, so WINS will try DNS as a fallback if it can't find a name. You can safely ignore the other options.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="sect3">

3.2.2.4 Hosts files</A></H4><P CLASS="para">If you don't have either DNS or WINS, and you don't wish to use broadcast name resolution, you'll need to provide a table of IP addresses and hosts names, in standard Unix <I CLASS="filename">
/etc/hosts</I> format. We recommend against this because maintenance of this file on any dynamic network is troublesome, but we will explain it just the same. The Windows host file should appear in the <EM CLASS="emphasis">
\WINDOWS\HOSTS</EM> directory of whatever local drive Windows is installed on. A sample follows:</P><PRE CLASS="programlisting">
&#13;127.0.0.1       localhost

If you wish, you can copy the contents directly from the Samba server's<I CLASS="filename">
 /etc/hosts</I>. The format is identical. This file will then serve the same purpose as the hosts file on the Unix server. Again, <EM CLASS="emphasis">
hosts</EM> files on Windows should only be used as a last resort.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="sect3">

Now for the big moment. Your Samba server is running and you have set up your NT client to communicate with it. After the machine reboots, login and double-click the Network Neighborhood icon on the desktop, and you should see your Samba server listed as a member of the workgroup, as shown in <A HREF="#ch03-50785" CLASS="xref">

<STRONG>
WARNING:</STRONG> If you are presented with a dialog requesting the password for a user <CODE CLASS="literal">
IPC$</CODE>, then Samba did not accept the password that was sent from the client. In this case, the username and the password that were created on the client side <EM CLASS="emphasis">
must</EM> match the username/password combination on the Samba server. If you are using Windows 98 or Windows NT Service Pack 3 or above, this is probably because the client is sending encrypted passwords instead of plaintext passwords. You can remedy this situation by performing two steps on the Samba server. First, add the following entry to the <CODE CLASS="literal">
[global]</CODE> section of your Samba configuration file: <CODE CLASS="literal">
encrypt password=yes</CODE>. Second, find the <I CLASS="filename">
smbpasswd</I> program on the samba server (it is located in <I CLASS="filename">
/usr/local/samba/bin</I> by default) and use it to add an entry to Samba's encrypted password database. For example, to add user <CODE CLASS="literal">
steve</CODE> to Samba's encrypted password database, type <CODE CLASS="replaceable">
<I>
smbpasswd  -a steve</I></CODE>. The first time you enter this password, the program will output an error message indicating that the password database does not exist; it will then create the database, which is typically stored in <I CLASS="filename">
/usr/local/samba/private/smbpasswd</I>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P CLASS="para">
If you don't see the server listed, don't panic. Start the Windows NT Explorer (not Internet Explorer!) and select Map Network Drive from the Tools menu. A dialog box appears that allows you to type the name of your server and its share directory in Windows format. For example, you would enter <I CLASS="filename">
\\</I><CODE CLASS="replaceable">
<I>
server</I></CODE><I CLASS="filename">
\temp</I> if your server happened to be named "server." If things still aren't right, go directly to the section "The Fault Tree" in <B>Chapter 9</B>, to see if you can troubleshoot what is wrong with the network.</P><P CLASS="para">
If it works, congratulations! Try writing to the server and sending data to the network printer. You will be pleasantly surprised how seamlessly everything works! Now that you've finished setting up the Samba server and its clients, we can starting talking about how Samba works and how to configure it to your liking.   </P></DIV></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
