An Introduction to SMB/CIFS</A></P><P>
</P></DIV><P CLASS="para">You'll be glad to know that configuring Windows to use your new Samba server is quite simple. SMB is Microsoft's native language for resource sharing on a local area network, so much of the installation and setup on the Windows client side has been taken care of already. The primary issues that we will cover in this chapter involve communication and coordination between Windows and Unix, two completely different operating systems.</P><P CLASS="para">
Samba uses TCP/IP to talk to its clients on the network. If you aren't already using TCP/IP on your Windows computers, this chapter will show you how to install it. Then you'll need to configure your Windows machines to operate on a TCP/IP network. Once these two requirements have been taken care of, we can show how to access a shared disk on the Samba server.</P><P CLASS="para">
This chapter is divided into three sections. The first section covers setting up Windows 95/98 computers while the second covers Windows NT 4.0 machines. The final section provides some prerequisite information on how SMB connections are made from Windows clients and servers, which is useful as we move into the later chapters of the book.</P><DIV CLASS="sect1">

<A NAME="ch03-55770" CLASS="title">
3.1 Setting Up Windows 95/98 Computers</A></H2><P CLASS="para">Unfortunately, Windows 95/98 wasn't designed for a PC to have more than one user; that concept is more inherent to a Unix operating system or Windows NT. However, Windows 95/98 does have <EM CLASS="emphasis">
limited</EM> support for multiple users: if you tell it, the operating system will keep a separate profile (desktop layout) and password file for each user. This is a far cry from true multiuser security. In other words, Windows 95/98 won't try to keep one user from destroying the work of another on the local hard drive like Unix, but profiles are a place to start.</P><DIV CLASS="sect2">
<H3 CLASS="sect2">
<A NAME="ch03-pgfId-941931" CLASS="title">
3.1.1 Accounts and Passwords</A></H3><P CLASS="para">The first thing we need to do is to tell Windows to keep user profiles separate, and to collect usernames and passwords to authenticate anyone trying to access a Samba share. We do so via the Password settings in the Control Panel. If you are not familiar with the Windows Control Panel, you can access it by choosing the Settings menu item from the pop-up menu of the Start button in the lower-left corner of the screen. Alternatively, you'll find it as a folder under the icon in the upper-left corner that represents your computer and is typically labeled My Computer.</P><P CLASS="para">
After selecting the Passwords icon in the Control Panel, click on the User Profiles tab on the far right. You should see the dialog box shown in <A HREF="#ch03-84319" CLASS="xref">
Figure 3.1</A>. Then click the lower of the two radio buttons that starts "Users can customize their preferences...." This causes Windows to store a separate profile for each user, and saves the username and password you provide, which it will use later when it connects to an SMB/CIFS server. Finally, check <EM CLASS="emphasis">
both</EM> the options under the User Profile Settings border, as shown in the figure.   </P><H4 CLASS="figure">

Figure 3.1: The Passwords Properties panel</A></H4><IMG ALT="Figure 3.1" CLASS="graphic" SRC="figs/sam.0301.gif"><P CLASS="para">
The next step is to select the Change Passwords tab on the left side of the dialog box. In order for Samba to allow you access to its shares, the username and password you give to Windows must match the account and password on the Samba server. If you don't have this tab in your dialog box, don't worry; it's probably because you haven't given yourself a Windows username and password yet. Simply click the OK button at the bottom and respond Yes when Windows asks to reboot. Then, skip down to the section entitled <A HREF="#ch03-57581" CLASS="xref">

Give yourself the same username and password that you have on the Samba server. After confirming your new username and password, or if you already have one, Windows should ask you if you want to have a profile, using the dialog shown in <A HREF="#ch03-48947" CLASS="xref">

Answer Yes, upon which Windows will create a separate profile and password file for you and save a copy of your password in the file. Now when you connect to Samba, Windows will send its password, which will be used to authenticate you for each share. We won't worry about profiles for the moment; we'll cover them in <B>Chapter 6, <CITE CLASS="chapter">
Users, Security, and Domains </CITE></B>. We should point out, however, that there is a small security risk: someone can steal the password file and decrypt the passwords because it's weakly encrypted. Unfortunately, there isn't a solution to this with Windows 95/98. In Windows 2000 (NT 5.0), the password encryption should be replaced with a much better algorithm.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="sect2">

3.1.2 Setting Up the Network</A></H3><P CLASS="para">The next thing we need to do is make sure we have the TCP/IP networking protocol set up correctly. To do this, double-click on the Network icon in the Control Panel. You should see the network configuration dialog box, as shown in <A HREF="#ch03-15320" CLASS="xref">

Microsoft networking works by binding specific protocols, such as IPX or TCP/IP, to a specific hardware device, such as an Ethernet card or a dialup connection. By routing a protocol through a hardware device, the machine can act as a client or server for a particular type of network. For Samba, we are interested in binding the TCP/IP protocol through a networking device, making the machine a client for Microsoft networks. Thus, when the dialog box appears, you should see at least the Client for Microsoft Networks component installed on the machine, and hopefully a networking device (preferably an Ethernet card) bound to the TCP/IP protocol. If there is only one networking hardware device, you'll see the TCP/IP protocol listed below that device. If it appears similar to <A HREF="#ch03-15320" CLASS="xref">
Figure 3.5</A>, the protocol is bound to the device.</P><P CLASS="para">
You may also see "File and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks," which is useful. In addition, you might see NetBEUI or Novell Networking, which are standard with Windows installations but undesirable when TCP/IP is running. Remove NetBEUI if you possibly can&nbsp;- it's unnecessary and makes debugging Windows browsing difficult. If you don't have any Novell servers on your network, you can remove Novell (IPX/SPX) as well.</P><DIV CLASS="sect3">

Installing TCP/IP isn't difficult since Microsoft distributes its own version of TCP/IP for free on their installation CD-ROM.

You can remedy this situation by performing two steps on the Samba server. First, add the following entry to the <CODE CLASS="literal">
[global]</CODE> section of your Samba configuration file: <CODE CLASS="literal">
encrypt password=yes</CODE>. Second, find the <I CLASS="filename">
smbpasswd</I> program on the samba server (it is located in <I CLASS="filename">
/usr/local/samba/bin</I> by default) and use it to add an entry to Samba's encrypted password database. For example, to add user <CODE CLASS="literal">
steve</CODE> to Samba's encrypted password database, type <CODE CLASS="replaceable">
<I>
smbpasswd  -a steve</I></CODE>. The first time you enter this password, the program will output an error message indicating that the password database does not exist; it will then create the database, which is typically stored in <I CLASS="filename">
/usr/local/samba/private/smbpasswd</I>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P CLASS="para">
If you don't see the server listed, start Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer!) and select Map Network Drive from the Tools menu. This will give you a dialog box into which you can type the name of your server and the share <CODE CLASS="literal">
test </CODE>in the Windows UNC format: <I CLASS="filename">
\\</I><CODE CLASS="replaceable">
<I>
server</I></CODE><I CLASS="filename">
\test</I>, like we did in the first chapter. This should attempt to contact the Samba server and its temporary share. If things still aren't right, go to <B>Chapter 9, <CITE CLASS="chapter">
Troubleshooting Samba</CITE></B>, for troubleshooting assistance. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
