<p>Not every document can be fetched with a simple GET or POST request.
Many pages require authentication before you can access them, some
use cookies to keep track of the different users, and still others
want special values in the <tt class="literal">Referer</tt> or
<tt class="literal">User-Agent</tt> headers. This chapter shows you how to
set arbitrary headers, manage cookies, and even authenticate using
LWP. You'll be able to make your LWP programs appear
to be Netscape or Internet Explorer, log in to a protected site, and
work with sites that use cookies.
</p>

<p>For example, suppose you're automating a web-based
purchasing system. The server requires you to log in, then issues you
a cookie to prove you've been authenticated. You
must then send this cookie back to the server with every request you
make.
</p>

<p>Or, more mundanely, suppose you're extracting
information from one of the many web sites that check the
<tt class="literal">User-Agent</tt> header in your requests. If your
<tt class="literal">User-Agent</tt> doesn't identify yours
as a recent version of Netscape or Internet Explorer, the server
sends you back an "Upgrade your
browser" page. You need to set the
<tt class="literal">User-Agent</tt> header to make it appear that you are
using Netscape or Internet Explorer.

<h2 class="sect1">11.1. Cookies</h2>

<p>HTTP was originally
<a name="INDEX-612" /></a>designed as a
stateless protocol, meaning that each request is totally independent
of other requests. But web site designers felt the need for something
to help them identify the user of a particular session. The mechanism
that does this is called a <em class="firstterm">cookie</em>. This
section gives some background on cookies so you know what LWP is
doing for you.
</p>

<p>An HTTP cookie is a string that an HTTP server can send to a client,
which the client is supposed to put in the headers of any future
requests that it makes to that server. Suppose a client makes a
request to a given server, and the response headers consist of this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Date: Thu, 28 Feb 2002 04:29:13 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.23 (Win32)
Content-Type: text/html
Set-Cookie: foo=bar; expires=Thu, 20 May 2010 01:23:45 GMT; path=/</pre></blockquote>

<p>This means that the server wants all further requests from this
client to anywhere on this site (i.e., under <tt class="literal">/</tt>) to
be accompanied by this header line:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Cookie: foo=bar</pre></blockquote>

<p>That header should be present in all this browser's
requests to this site, until May 20, 2010 (at 1:23:45 in the
morning), after which time the client should never send that cookie
again.
</p>

<p>A <tt class="literal">Set-Cookie</tt> line can fail to
<a name="INDEX-613" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-614" /></a>specify an expiration time, in which case
this cookie ends at the end of this
"session," where
"session" is generally seen as
ending when the user closes all browser windows. Moreover, the path
can be something more specific than <tt class="literal">/</tt>. It can be,
for example, <em class="filename">/dahut/</em>, in which case a cookie
will be sent only for URLs that begin
<em class="emphasis">htt</em><em class="filename">p://thishost/dahut/</em>.
Finally, a cookie can specify that this site is not just on this one
host, but also on all other hosts in this subdomain, so that if this
host is <em class="filename">search.mybazouki.com</em>, cookies should be
sent to any hostname under <em class="filename">mybazouki.com</em>,
including <em class="filename">images.mybazouki.com</em>,
<em class="filename">ads.mybazouki.com</em>,
<em class="filename">extra.stuff.mybazouki.com</em>, and so on.
</p>

<p>All those details are handled by LWP, and you need
<a name="INDEX-615" /></a>only make a
few decisions for a given LWP::UserAgent object:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Should it implement cookies at all? If not, it will just ignore any
<tt class="literal">Set-Cookie:</tt> headers from the server and will never
send any <tt class="literal">Cookie:</tt> headers.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Should it load cookies when it starts up? If not, it will start out
with no cookies.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Should it save cookies to some file when the browser object is
destroyed? If not, whatever cookies it has accumulated will be lost.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>What format should the cookies file be in? Currently the choices are
either a format particular to LWP, or Netscape cookies files.
</p>
</li></ul>
<a name="perllwp-CHP-11-SECT-1.1" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.1. Enabling Cookies</h3>

<p>By default, an LWP::UserAgent object
<a name="INDEX-616" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-617" /></a>doesn't
implement cookies. To make an LWP::UserAgent object that implements
cookies is as simple as this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new( );
$browser-&gt;cookie_jar( {} );</pre></blockquote>

<p>However, that browser object's cookie jar (as we
call its HTTP cookie database) will start out empty, and its contents
won't be saved anywhere when the object is
destroyed. Incidentally, the above code is a convenient shortcut for
what one previously had to do:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># Load LWP class for "cookie jar" objects
use HTTP::Cookies;
my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new( );
my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies-&gt;new( );
$browser-&gt;cookie_jar( $cookie_jar );</pre></blockquote>

<p>There's not much point to using the long form when
you could use the short form instead, but the longer form becomes
preferable when you're adding options to the cookie
jar.
</p>

</div>
<a name="perllwp-CHP-11-SECT-1.2" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.2. Loading Cookies from a File</h3>

<p>To start the cookie jar by
<a name="INDEX-618" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-619" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-620" /></a> <a name="INDEX-621" /></a>loading from a particular file,
use the <tt class="literal">file</tt> option to the
<tt class="literal">HTTP::Cookies</tt> <tt class="literal">new</tt> method:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use HTTP::Cookies;
my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies-&gt;new(
   file     =&gt; "/some/where/cookies.lwp",
);
my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
$browser-&gt;cookie_jar( $cookie_jar );</pre></blockquote>

<p>In that case, the file is read when the cookie jar is created, but
it's never updated with any new cookies that the
<tt class="literal">$browser</tt> object will have accumulated.
</p>

<p>To read the cookies from a Netscape cookies file instead
<a name="INDEX-622" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-623" /></a>of
from an LWP-format cookie file, use a different class,
HTTP::Cookies::Netscape, which is just like HTTP::Cookies, except for
the format that it reads and writes:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use HTTP::Cookies::Netscape;
my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::Netscape-&gt;new(
   file =&gt; "c:/program files/netscape/users/shazbot/cookies.txt",
);
my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
$browser-&gt;cookie_jar( $cookie_jar );</pre></blockquote>

</div>
<a name="perllwp-CHP-11-SECT-1.3" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.3. Saving Cookies to a File</h3>

<p>To make LWP write out its
<a name="INDEX-624" /></a>potentially changed cookie jar to a file
when the object is no longer in use, add an <tt class="literal">autosave =&gt;
1</tt> parameter:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use HTTP::Cookies;
my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies-&gt;new(
   file     =&gt; "/some/where/cookies.lwp",
   autosave =&gt; 1,
);
my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
$browser-&gt;cookie_jar( $cookie_jar );</pre></blockquote>

<p>At time of this writing, using <tt class="literal">autosave</tt>
<tt class="literal">=&gt;</tt> <tt class="literal">1</tt> with
HTTP::Cookies::Netscape has not been sufficiently tested and is not
recommended.

<a name="perllwp-CHP-11-SECT-1.4" /></a><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.1.4. Cookies and the New York Times Site</h3>

<p>Suppose that you have felt
<a name="INDEX-625" /></a> <a name="INDEX-626" /></a>
<a name="INDEX-627" /></a>personally emboldened and empowered by
all the previous chapters' examples of pulling data
off of news sites, especially the examples of simplifying HTML in
<a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "Modifying HTML with Trees"</a>. You decide that a great test of your
skill would be to write LWP code that downloads the stories off
various newspapers' web sites and saves them all in
a format (either plain text, highly simplified HTML, or even WML, if
you have an <tt class="literal">html2wml</tt> tool around) that your
ancient but trusty 2001-era PDA can read. Thus, you can spend your
commute time on the train (or bus, tube, el, metro, jitney, T, etc.)
merrily flipping through the day's news stories from
papers all over the world.
</p>

<p>Suppose also that you have the basic HTML-simplifying code in place
(so we shall not discuss it further), and the LWP code that downloads
stories from all the newspapers is working fine&#x2014;except for the
<em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> site. And you
can't imagine why it's not working!
You have a simple HTML::TokeParser program
<a name="INDEX-628" /></a>that gets the main page,
finds all the URLs to stories in it, and downloads them one at a
time. You verify that those routines are working fine. But when you
look at the files that it claims to be successfully fetching and
saving (<tt class="literal">$response-&gt;is_success</tt> returns true and
everything!), all you see for each one is a page that says
"Welcome to the New York Times on the Web! Already a
member? Log in!" When you look at the exact same URL
in Netscape, you don't see that page at all, but
instead you see the news story that you want your LWP program to be
accessing.
</p>

<p>Then it hits you: years ago, the first time you accessed the
<em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> site, it wanted you to register
with an email address and a password. But you
haven't seen that screen again, because of... HTTP
cookies! You riffle through your Netscape HTTP cookies file, and lo,
there you find:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">.nytimes.com TRUE / FALSE 1343279235 RMID 809ac0ad1cff9a6b</pre></blockquote>

<p>Whatever this means to the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> site,
it's apparently what differentiates your copy of
Netscape when it's accessing a story URL, from your
LWP program when it's accessing that URL.
</p>

<p>Now, you could simply hardwire that cookie into the headers of the
<tt class="literal">$browser-&gt;get( )</tt> request's
headers, but that involves recalling exactly how lines in Netscape
cookie databases translate into headers in HTTP request. The
optimally lazy solution is to simply enable cookie support in this
LWP::UserAgent object and have it read your Netscape cookie database.
So just after where you started off the program with this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use LWP;
my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new( );</pre></blockquote>

<p>Add this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use <tt class="userinput"><b>HTTP::Cookies::Netscape</b></tt>;
my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::Netscape-&gt;new(
 <tt class="userinput"><b>'file' =&gt;</b></tt> 'c:/program files/netscape/users/me/cookies.txt'
);
$browser-&gt;cookie_jar($cookie_jar);</pre></blockquote>

<p>With those five lines of code added, your LWP
program's requests to the <em class="emphasis">New York
Times</em>'s server will carry the cookie that
says that you're a registered user. So instead of
giving your LWP program the "Log
in!" page ad infinitum, the <em class="emphasis">New York
Times</em>'s server now merrily serves your
program the news stories. Success!
