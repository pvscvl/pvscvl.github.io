<h2 class="sect1">1.2. History of LWP</h2>

<p>The following history
<a name="INDEX-16" />of LWP was written by Gisle Aas, one of the
creators of LWP and its current maintainer.
</p>

<p>The libwww-perl project was <a name="INDEX-17" />started at the very first WWW conference
held in Geneva in 1994. At the conference, Martijn Koster met Roy
Fielding who was presenting the work he
<a name="INDEX-18" />
<a name="INDEX-19" />had
done on MOMspider. MOMspider was a Perl program that traversed the
Web looking for broken links and built an index of the documents and
links discovered. Martijn suggested turning the reusable components
of this program into a library. The result was the libwww-perl
library for Perl 4 that Roy maintained.
</p>

<p>Later the same year, Larry Wall made the first
"stable" release of Perl 5
available. It was obvious that the module system and object-oriented
features that the new version of Perl provided make
Roy's library even better. At one point, both
Martijn and myself had made our own separate modifications of
libwww-perl. We joined forces, merged our designs, and made several
alpha releases. Unfortunately, Martijn ended up in disagreement with
his employer about the intellectual property rights of work done
outside hours. To safeguard the code's continued
availability to the Perl community, he asked me to take over
maintenance of it.
</p>

<p>The LWP:: module <a name="INDEX-20" />namespace was introduced by Martijn in
one of the early alpha releases. This name choice was lively
discussed on the libwww mailing list. It was soon pointed out that
this name could be confused with what certain implementations of
threads called themselves, but no better name alternatives emerged.
In the last message on this matter, Martijn concluded,
"OK, so we all agree LWP stinks
:-)." The name stuck and has established itself.
</p>

<p>If you search for "LWP" on Google
today, you <a name="INDEX-21" />have to go to 30th position before you
find a link about threads.
</p>

<p>In May 1996, we made the first non-beta release of libwww-perl for
Perl 5. It was called release 5.00 because it was for Perl 5. This
made some room for Roy to maintain libwww-perl for Perl 4, called
libwww-perl-0.40. Martijn continued to contribute but was
unfortunately "rolled over by the Java
train."
</p>

<p>In 1997-98, I tried to redesign LWP around the concept of an event
loop under the name LWPng. This allowed many nice things: multiple
requests could be handled in parallel and on the same connection,
requests could be pipelined to improve round-trip time, and HTTP/1.1
was actually supported. But the tuits to finish it up never came, so
this branch must by now be regarded as dead. I still hope some brave
soul shows up and decides to bring it back to life.
</p>

<p>1998 was also the year that the HTML:: modules were unbundled from
the core LWP distribution and the year after Sean M. Burke showed up
and took over maintenance of the HTML-Tree distribution, actually
making it handle all the real-world HTML that you will find. I had
kind of given up on dealing with all the strange HTML that the web
ecology had let develop. Sean had enough dedication to make sense of
it.
</p>

<p>Today LWP is in strict maintenance mode with a much slower release
cycle. The code base seems to be quite solid and capable of doing
what most people expect it to.
