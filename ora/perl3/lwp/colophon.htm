<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>

<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>

<p>The animals on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Perl and LWP</em> are blesbok. Blesbok
are African antelopes related to the hartebeest. These grazing
animals, native to Africa's grasslands are extinct in the wild but
preserved in farms and parks.</p>

<p>Blesbok have slender, horselike bodies that are shorter than four feet at the shoulder. They are deep red, with white patches on their faces and rumps. A white blaze extends from between a blesbok's horns to the end of its nose, broken only by a brown band above the eyes. The blesbok's horns sweep back, up, and inward. Both male and female blesbok have horns, though the males' are thicker.</p>

<p>Blesbok are diurnal, most active in the morning and evening. They sleep in the shade during the hottest part of the day, as they are very susceptible to the heat. They travel from place to place in long single-file lines, leaving distinct paths. Their life span is about 13 years. </p>

<p>Linley Dolby was the production editor and copyeditor for <em class="citetitle">Perl
and LWP</em>, and Sarah Sherman was the proofreader. Rachel Wheeler and
Claire Cloutier provided quality control. Johnna VanHoose Dinse wrote
the index. Emily Quill provided production support.</p>

<p>Emma Colby designed the cover of this book, based on a series design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is a 19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Emma Colby produced the cover layout with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond font. </p>

<p>Melanie Wang designed the interior layout, based on a series design by David Futato. This book was converted to FrameMaker 5.5.6 with a format conversion tool created by Erik Ray, Jason McIntosh, Neil Walls, and Mike Sierra that uses Perl and XML technologies. The text font is Linotype Birka; the heading font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is LucasFont's TheSans Mono Condensed. The illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano and Jessamyn Read using Macromedia FreeHand 9 and Adobe Photoshop 6. This colophon was written by Linley Dolby.</p>
