<h2 class="sect1">8.2. Getting the Data</h2>

<p>The first step is to figure out what web pages we need to request to
get the data in any form. With the BBC extractor, it was just a
matter of requesting the single page
<em class="emphasis">http://news.bbc.co.uk</em>, but here
there's no one page that lists all the data we want.
Instead, you can view the program description for each show, one day
at a time. Moreover, the URL for each such page looks like this,
which displays the program info for July 2, 2001:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">http://freshair.npr.org/dayFA.cfm?todayDate=07%2F02%2F2001</pre></blockquote>

<p>It's relatively clear that the format for the bit
after the equal sign is the two-digit month, <tt class="literal">%2F</tt>,
the two-digit day, <tt class="literal">%2F</tt>, and the four-digit year.
(It's even more clear when you consider that
<tt class="literal">%2F</tt> is the <tt class="literal">/</tt> character encoded,
so that the above means <tt class="literal">07/02/2001</tt>.) Harvesting
all the data is a simple matter of iterating over all the days of the
month (or whatever period you want to cover), skipping weekends
(because the program listings are only for weekdays), substituting
the proper date numbers into that URL. Once each page is harvested,
the data can be extracted from it.
</p>

<p>Already the outlines of the program's design are
becoming clear: there needs to be a loop that harvests the contents
of a URL based on each date, then scans the returned content.
Scanning the content isn't a distinct enough task
that it has to be part of the same block of code as the code that
actual harvests the URL. Instead, it can simply be a routine that is
given a new stream from which it is expected to extract data.
Moreover, that is the hard part of the program, so we might as well
do that first (the stuff with date handling and URL interpolation is
much less worrisome, and can be put off until last).
</p>

<p>So, to figure out the format of the data we want to harvest, consider
a typical program listing page in its rendered form in a browser. We
establish that this is a "typical"
page (shown in <a href="ch08_02.htm">Figure 8-1</a>) by flipping through the
listings and finding that they all pretty much look like that. (That
stands to reason, as the URL tells us that they're
being served dynamically, and all through the same
<em class="emphasis">.cfm</em>&#x2014;Cold Fusion&#x2014;file, such that
having each day's bit of content poured into a
common template is the easy way for the web site's
designers to have implemented this.) So we have good reason to hope
that whatever code we work up to extract successfully from one
typical page, would hopefully work for all of them. The only
remarkable difference is in the number of segments per show: here
there's two, but there could be one, or four, or
even more. Also, the descriptions can be several paragraphs,
sometimes much shorter.

<p>What we want to extract here is the link text that says
"Monday - July 2, 2001,"
"Editor and writer Walter Kirn,"
and "Casting director and actress Joanna
Merlin," and for each we also want the link URL as
an absolute URL. We don't want the
"Listen to" part, since
it'd be pointlessly repetitive to have a whole
month's worth of listings where every line starts
with "Listen to".
