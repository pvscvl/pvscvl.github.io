<h2 class="sect1">1.4. Words of Caution</h2>

<p>In theory, the underlying mechanisms of the Web make no difference
between a browser getting data and displaying it to you, and your
LWP-based program getting data and doing something else with it.
However, in practice, almost all the data on the Web was put there
with the assumption (sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit) that it
would be looked at directly in a browser. When you write an LWP
program that downloads that data, you are working against that
assumption. The trick is to do this in as considerate a way as
possible.
</p>

<a name="perllwp-CHP-1-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.1. Network and Server Load</h3>

<p>When you access a web server, <a name="INDEX-36" />
<a name="INDEX-37" />you
are using scarce resources. You are using your bandwidth and the web
server's bandwidth. Moreover, processing your
request places a load on the remote server, particularly if the page
you're requesting has to be dynamically generated,
and especially if that dynamic generation involves database access.
If you're writing a program that requests several
pages from a given server but you don't need the
pages immediately, you should write delays into your program (such as
<tt class="literal">sleep 60;</tt> to sleep for one minute), so that the
load that you're placing on the network and on the
web server is spread unobtrusively over a longer period of time.
</p>

<p>If possible, you might even want to consider having your program run
in the middle of the night (<em class="emphasis">modulo</em> the relevant
time zones), when network usage is low and the web server is not
likely to be busy handling a lot of requests. Do this only if you
<em class="emphasis">know</em> there is no risk of your program behaving
unpredictably. In <a href="ch12_01.htm">Chapter 12, "Spiders"</a><em class="emphasis">,</em>
we discuss programs with definite risk of that happening; do not let
such programs run unattended until you have added appropriate
safeguards and carefully checked that they behave as you expect them
to.

<a name="perllwp-CHP-1-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.2. Copyright</h3>

<p>While the complexities of <a name="INDEX-38" />
<a name="INDEX-39" />national and international copyright
law can't be covered in a page or two (or even a
library or two), the short story is that just because you can get
some data off the Web doesn't mean you can do
whatever you want with it. The things you do with data on the Web
form a continuum, as far as their relation to copyright law. At the
one end is direct use, where you sit at your browser, downloading and
reading pages as the site owners clearly intended. At the other end
is illegal use, where you run a program that hammers a remote server
as it copies and saves copyrighted data that was not meant for free
public consumption, then saves it all to your public web server,
which you then encourage people to visit so that you can make money
off of the ad banners you've put there. Between
these extremes, there are many gray areas involving considerations of
"fair use," a tricky concept. The
safest guide in trying to stay on the right side of copyright law is
to ask, by using the data this way, could I possibly be depriving the
original web site of some money that it would/could otherwise get?
</p>

<p>For example, suppose that you set up a program that copies data every
hour from the Yahoo! Weather site, for the 50 most populous towns in
your state. You then copy the data directly to your public web site
and encourage everyone to visit it. Even though "no
one owns the weather," even if any particular bit of
weather data is in the public domain (which it may be, depending on
its source), Yahoo! Weather put time and effort into making a
collection of that data, presented in a certain way. And as such, the
<em class="emphasis">collection</em> of data is copyrighted.
</p>

<p>Moreover, by posting the data publicly, you are almost definitely
taking viewers away from Yahoo! Weather, which means less ad revenue
for them. Even if Yahoo! Weather didn't have any ads
and so wasn't obviously making any money off of
viewers, your having the data online elsewhere means that if Yahoo!
Weather wanted to start having ads tomorrow, they'd
be unable to make as much money at it, because there would be people
in the habit of looking at your web site's weather
data instead of at theirs.

<h3 class="sect2">1.4.3. Acceptable Use</h3>

<p>Besides the protection
<a name="INDEX-40" />provided by copyright law, many web
sites have "terms of use" or
"acceptable use" policies, where
the web site owners basically say "as a user, you
may do this and this, but not that or that, and if you
don't abide by these terms, then we
don't want you using this web
site." For example, a search
engine's terms of use might stipulate that you
should not make "automated queries"
to their system, nor should you show the search data on another site.
</p>

<p>Before you start pulling data off of a web site, you should put good
effort into looking around for its terms of service document, and
take the time to read it and reasonably interpret what it says. When
in doubt, ask the web site's administrators whether
what you have in mind would bother them.
