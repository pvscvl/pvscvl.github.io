<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>

<p>Perl is arguably the most popular scripting language in use today. It
is used for a wide variety of tasks, including file processing,
system administration, web programming, and database connectivity.
Early Perl users had to be content with command-line interfaces or
full-screen interfaces using Curses or similar systems, but the
splitting-off of the Tk widget library from the Tcl language opened a
whole new world to Perl. Perl programmers could now easily create
graphical interfaces for their programs using Tk's flexible and
friendly widget set and, with little effort, those programs could be
made to work across Windows and Unix platforms.
</p>

<p>The relatively recent advent of the web browser would seem to have
made the Tk interface obsolete. CGI programs are almost inherently
cross-platform and provide many of the same widgets as Tk (this
includes Menus, Buttons, text entry fields, and so on). However, the
inherent statelessness of the Web makes it difficult to write some
programs for it. Perl/Tk provides a richer widget set than that
available to the CGI programmer. Server push and client pull try to
get around some of these limitations, while JavaScript fills in other
gaps, but the fact is, the user experience still falls short in many
instances. It is for precisely this reason that Perl/Tk continues to
flourish.
</p>

<p>The Tk module gives the Perl programmer full access to the powerful
Tk widget set. This rich and diverse library, like Perl itself, makes
the easy things easy and the hard things possible. Easy things
include designing graphical interfaces with Buttons, Checkbuttons,
Menus, and text entry fields&#x2014;all of which you will learn about
in the first half of this book. The second half of the book contains
more advanced topics, such as creating custom widgets, interprocess
communication, images, animation, and key bindings. The goal of this
book is to take you from Tk neophyte to Tk expert.

<h2 class="sect1">0.1. History of This Book</h2>

<p>This book evolved from the book <em class="citetitle">Learning
Perl/Tk</em> by Nancy Walsh (O'Reilly). While the
response to that book made it clear that there were many avid and
loyal Perl/Tk users, readers also let us know that they wished the
book showed advanced techniques, covered some nonstandard widgets,
and included more extended examples of Perl/Tk programming.
</p>

<p>So Nancy teamed up with Steve Lidie, already a seasoned Perl/Tk
programmer and author, and together they doubled the size of the book
and changed its title to befit its expansion. The baby emu on the
cover of <em class="citetitle">Learning Perl/Tk</em> grew into the adult
emu on the cover of this book. Programmers who are new to Perl/Tk can
still learn from this book, but as the title says, this book will
also turn you into a master.
