<h2 class="sect1">0.7. Acknowledgments</h2>



<blockquote>What Descartes did was a good step. You have added much several ways,
and especially in taking ye colours of thin plates into philosophical
consideration. If I have seen further it is by standing on ye
shoulders of Giants.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;<em>Newton to Hooke, 5 February 1676; Corres 1, 416.</em></blockquote>




<p>Embodied in this statement is the simple truth that all work is
derived, in one manner or another, from insights and knowledge gained
from others. And so it is with this book. Its creation would have
been impossible without a talented team of Giants, whose
contributions we can only feebly recognize.

<h3 class="sect2">0.7.1. Steve</h3>

<p>I'm especially grateful to my wife Carol, whom I neglected for
all these months. It was her patience, love, and support that kept me
going. And to my parents, Ken and Sally, thank you for providing the
nurturing that made me what I am today.
</p>

<p>Thanks to the creator of Tcl/Tk, John Ousterhout, who brought
graphical programming from the dungeons of assembler to the bright
light of high-level programming. And let's not forget the Tcl
community, largely responsible for shaping the development of Tk.
Thanks in particular to one Tcl illuminary, Cameron Laird, the
maintainer of the Perl/Tk FAQ.
</p>

<p>Many thanks to Linda Mui, our editor, and to the book's
reviewers: Andy Duncan, Brand Hilton, Nick Ing-Simmons, Slaven Rezic,
and Martin Stoufer. They all devoted lots of time and effort, and on
short notice, to the task at hand. Unfortunately for me, but luckily
for you, they spotted many typographical and technical errors, and
provided many ideas that enhanced the quality of this work. I'm
especially indebted to Andy, Brand, and Slaven who read the entire
manuscript <em class="emphasis">multiple times.</em>
</p>

<p>I would be remiss if I neglected to mention the many programmers from
the Perl community who helped shape Perl/Tk, either by directly
contributing code, or simply providing thoughtful and accurate
answers to questions posted on the mailing list and on
<em class="filename">comp.lang.perl.tk</em>. I've no doubt missed
some names, and I apologize in advance. Here, then, is the partial
list: Andrew Allen, William Asquith, Graham Barr, Booker C. Bense,
Eric Bohlman, Achim Bohnet, H. Merijn Brand, John Cerney, Damian
Conway, <tt class="literal">brian</tt> <tt class="literal">d</tt>
<tt class="literal">foy</tt>, Marc Dashevsky, Chris Dean, Dominique Dumont,
Jack Dunnigan, Toby Everett, Ron Hartikka, Hans J&#xF8;rgen
Helgesen, Grant Hopwood, Rajappa Iyer, Tim Jenness, Mark Lakata,
Tripp Lilley, Greg London, Tad McClellan, Andrew Page, Phiroze
Parakh, Ben Pavon, Bent B. Powers, Peter Prymmer, Ala Qumsieh,
Andreas Reuter, Thomas Schmickl, Monty Scroggins, Rob Seegel, Jason
A. Smith, Jonathan Stowe, Anthony Thyssen, Damion K. Wilson, and Ilya
Zakharevich.
</p>

<p>As an unsung hero, thanks to Malcolm Beattie, creator of
<i class="command">tkperl</i>, from which Perl/Tk sprang. And, lastly,
copious thanks to Nick Ing-Simmons and Larry Wall. Together they have
created my favorite language, Perl, and my favorite Perl module, Tk.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">0.7.2. Nancy</h3>

<p>My husband Michael has been an incredible source of support for me,
encouraging me and allowing me to take the time out from our lives
together to complete this. Thanks to our kitties, Thumper and Sasha,
and the "puppies," Brandy and Theo. All our animals kept
me company by walking across the keyboard at the perfect moment or
barking just to keep me awake. As always, any typos are purely the
cats' fault, but I love them anyway. Many thanks to my parents,
Patricia and Delvin, who have been there for me my whole life helping
me out when I needed it and sometimes when I didn't know I
needed it.
</p>

<p>Thanks to all the staff at O'Reilly, especially our editor
Linda Mui. Thanks to all the technical reviewers; you did a great
job: Andy Duncan, Brand Hilton, Nick Ing-Simmons, Slaven Rezic, and
Martin Stoufer. I want to specifically thank Brand Hilton, who often
encouraged me and sent me emails answering questions that I would
toss to him out of the blue.
</p>

<p>A huge thanks to everyone out there in the Perl community who has
contributed to, or even just used, Perl/Tk. You all know who you are;
keep up the great work.
</p>
