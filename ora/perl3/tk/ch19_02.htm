<h2 class="sect1">19.2. IPADM Design Considerations</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-2951" /><a name="INDEX-2952" /><a name="INDEX-2953" /><a name="INDEX-2954" />The programs detailed in the
remainder of this chapter work in unison to help manage Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS)
configuration files. Now, you don't have to know anything about
DHCP or DNS, or managing IP networks for that matter; we're
more concerned with how to manipulate these files remotely, rather
than with their actual content.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2955" /><a name="INDEX-2956" />Suppose we have a company, ACME
Rocket Supply, Incorporated, which has a class B IP network,
192.168.0.0.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-50">[50]</a> The site administrator has
subnetted this address space by department; for instance, IP numbers
192.168.1.0 through 192.168.1.255 are assigned to the accounting
department, while 192.168.2.0 through 192.168.2.255 are for
purchasing. The administrator also decided to make each department
responsible for managing its own computers and printers, and has
delegated and trained several responsible persons. But he
doesn't want his helpers to have direct access to the server
machine. So he has written a Perl/Tk TCP/IP client,
<em class="emphasis">ipadm</em>, for remote IP administration.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-50" /><p> [50] This is actually a private address space
that anyone can use, as long as the addresses remain on the internal
network. We'll freely use any of the 65,536 IP numbers in the
range 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255 without fear of interfering
with a valid address.</p> </blockquote>

<p><a name="INDEX-2957" /><a name="INDEX-2958" />There
are various DHCP and DNS programs, and
<em class="emphasis">ACME.com</em>'s network administrator chose not
to limit his choices by writing <em class="emphasis">ipadm</em> for any
particular flavors. Instead, he invented a metafile that describes an
individual subnet, which can be sent to a filter to produce DHCP and
DNS configuration files in whatever format is required. It's
these metafiles (subnet definitions) that are remotely manipulated.
Each subnet definition file consists of two sections, separated by a
<tt class="literal">__NODES__</tt> line. The following is a sample subnet
description file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Title = Subnet 128B, ACME Rubber Band Development
Domain = RubberBand.ACME.Com
Base_IP = 192.168.128.16
Subnet_Mask = 255.255.255.240
Gateway = 192.168.128.30
__NODES__
JetDirect3:192.168.128.17:00abcd00abcd:print::Network Print Server
Coyote:192.168.128.18:00abce00abce:Badguy:Mail.ACME.COM:SGI  1
Roadrunner:192.168.128.19:00abcf00abcf:Goodguy:Mail.ACME.COM:SGI  2</pre></blockquote>

<p>The first section lists characteristics of the subnet as a whole,
while the second section defines every subnet node. (We'll
learn more about each colon-separated field in a node definition in <a href="ch19_03.htm">Section 19.3.2, "The Subnet Widget Edits a Subnet Description"</a>.) Using flat
file databases is a common technique in the Unix world, so
we'll call these files SDBs, for subnet databases.
</p>

<p>All the SDB files are centrally located in a single directory on the
DHCP/DNS server machine, and a forking TCP/IP daemon serves them to
Perl/Tk clients. The daemon, <em class="emphasis">ipadmd</em>, and client,
<em class="emphasis">ipadm,</em> communicate using four IPADM messages,
all originated by the client:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt class="literal">get_subnet_list</tt> </dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-2959" />Tells the daemon to return a list of all
subnets. <em class="emphasis">ipadmd</em></tt> does this by reading the Title
line of each SDB file (<a href="ch19_02.htm">Figure 19-2</a>).
</p>
</dd>


<dt><tt class="literal">get_subnet_file</tt> </dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-2960" />Tells the daemon to lock an SDB file for
exclusive access and return its contents.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><tt class="literal">put_subnet_file</tt> </dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-2961" />Tells the daemon to expect an updated
version of an SDB file, which it uses to rewrite the master copy.
<em class="emphasis">ipadmd</em></tt> then releases its exclusive lock on the
SDB file.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><tt class="literal">unl_subnet_file</tt> </dt>
<dd>
<a name="INDEX-2962" />Tells the daemon to simply release its
exclusive lock on an SDB, as the client has canceled all changes.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p><a name="INDEX-2963" />These four messages and their
responses make up the IPADM protocol. Once the protocol is defined,
we know <em class="emphasis">exactly</em> what each component of the
system can and cannot do. But a formal protocol definition needs to
be much more comprehensive and define in detail the format of each
command and response. We won't do that here. Instead,
we'll look at the actual code. Suffice it to say, each message
consists of a command line, zero or more lines of data, and a
terminator. The command line, which may have arguments, ends with a
newline, as do the data and terminator lines. The terminator, which
we'll refer to simply as <tt class="literal">$EOF</tt>, is a funny
string guaranteed to be unique; that is, it will never occur anywhere
in a message. The message response includes a one-line command
completion status, zero or more lines of data, and the terminator,
<tt class="literal">$EOF</tt>.

<p><a name="INDEX-2964" />The daemon also
maintains an SDBM file containing the last modification times of all
the SDB files. Periodically, it uses this information to see which
SDBs have recently changed and invokes the filter procedure to create
updated versions of the DHCP/DNS configuration files. Of course, the
filter must exclusively lock SDB files before it can do its work.
