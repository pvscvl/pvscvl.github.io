<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>

<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>



<p>The bird on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Mastering Perl/Tk</em> is an emu (<em class="emphasis">Dromaius
novaehollandiae</em>). This large, flightless bird is found throughout the
Australian bush steppes. The emu is one of the largest birds in
existence, second only to its cousin, the ostrich. Adult emus stand
about 5 feet high and weigh up to 120 pounds. The grayish-brown emu's
small wings contain only six or seven feathers. They are hidden by the
long, hairlike rump plumage. Emus have extremely long legs, which they
use as defensive and offensive weapons when fighting. A human limb can
be broken by a kick from an emu. Their powerful legs make emus strong
swimmers and fast runners; they can reach speeds of up to 50
kilometers per hour.</p>


<p>Male emus, which are slightly smaller than females, tend to the
incubation of eggs and the raising of the young. An emu nest contains
as much as fifteen to twenty-five deep green eggs, laid by several
hens. Incubation of the eggs takes from twenty-five to sixty days. The
large discrepancy in incubation time occurs because the male needs to
leave the nest periodically to find food and drink. The length of time
he is away affects the time for incubation. Newly hatched emus weigh
about 15 ounces. They are fully grown at two to three years.</p>


<p>The relationship between emus and Australian farmers has always
been adversarial; three coastal subspecies of emu have been
exterminated. Because emus can jump over high fences, it is difficult
to keep them out of fields, where they eat and trample crops. In the
arid Australian bush, emus also compete with cattle and sheep for
grass and water. On the other hand, emus eat many insects that would
otherwise eat crops. In 1932, Australian farmers declared war on the
emus, making an all-out effort to eradicate them. Fortunately, the
effort failed. The battle between emus and farmers continues to this
day.</p>


<p>Linley Dolby was the production editor and copyeditor for
<em class="emphasis">Mastering Perl/Tk</em>. Sada Preisch was the proofreader. Jeffrey Holcomb

index. Phil Dangler, Derek Di Matteo, Edie Shapiro, and Sarah Sherman
provided production support.</p>


<p>Pam Spremulli designed the cover of this book, based on a series
design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is a 19th-century engraving
from Johnson's Natural History II. Emma Colby produced the cover
layout with QuarkXPress 4.1, using Adobe's ITC Garamond font.</p>

 
<p>Melanie Wang designed the interior layout, based on a series design by David Futato. Neil Walls implemented the design in FrameMaker 5.5.6, using tools created by Mike Sierra. The text font is Linotype Birka; the heading font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is LucasFont's TheSans Mono Condensed. The illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano and Jessamyn Read, using Macromedia FreeHand 9 and Adobe Photoshop 6. This colophon was written by Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary.</p>
