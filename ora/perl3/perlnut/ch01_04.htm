<h2 class="sect1">1.4. Perl Resources</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-11" /><a name="INDEX-12" />Paradoxically,
the way in which Perl helps you the most has almost nothing to do
with Perl itself, and everything to do with the people who use Perl.
While people start using Perl because they need it, they continue
using Perl because they love it.
</p>

<p>The result is that the Perl community is one of the most helpful in
the world, with CPAN&#x2014;the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network&#x2014;as one example. When Perl programmers
aren't writing their own programs, they spend their
time helping others write theirs. They discuss common problems and
help devise solutions. They develop utilities and modules for Perl
and give them away to the world at large.
</p>

<a name="perlnut2-CHP-1-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.1. The comp.lang.perl.* Newsgroups</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-13" /><a name="INDEX-14" />The central meeting
place for Perl aficionados is Usenet. If you're not
familiar with Usenet, it's a collection of
special-interest groups (called <em class="emphasis">newsgroups</em>) on
the Internet. For most anyone using a modern browser, Usenet access
is as simple as a selecting a menu option on the browser. Perl
programmers should consider subscribing to the following newsgroups:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.announce</em></i></dt>
<dd>
A moderated newsgroup with announcements about new utilities or
products related to Perl
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.misc</em></i></dt>
<dd>
The general-purpose newsgroup devoted to non-CGI-related Perl
programming questions
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.moderated</em></i></dt>
<dd>
A moderated newsgroup intended to be a forum for more controlled,
restrained discussions about Perl
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.modules</em></i></dt>
<dd>
A newsgroup devoted to using and developing Perl modules</p>
</dd>


<dt><i><em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.tk</em></i></dt>
<dd>
A newsgroup concentrating on Perl/Tk, the graphical extension to Perl</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi</i></dt>
<dd>
A newsgroup for CGI questions in general, but mostly for Perl-related
questions
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>At some point, it seems like every Perl programmer subscribes to
<em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.misc</em>. You may
eventually abandon it if the discussion becomes too detailed, too
belligerent, or too bizarre for your taste. But
you'll likely find yourself coming back from time to
time, either to ask a question or just to check out the latest buzz.
</p>

<p>One bit of advice, however: before posting questions to <em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.misc</em> (or any newsgroup, for
that matter), you should read the group for a few days and read the
FAQ (see <a href="ch01_04.htm">Section 1.4.2, "Frequently Asked Questions Lists (FAQs)"</a>). The
<em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.*</em> newsgroups are a
wonderful resource if you have an interesting or unusual question,
but no one can save you if you ask something that's
covered in the FAQ.
</p>

<p>By the way, if you're a first-time poster to
<em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.misc</em>, you
shouldn't be surprised if you receive an email
message listing various resources on Perl that you may not know
about. This is done via an
"auto-faq" service, which scans all
postings and sends this helpful email to anyone who
hasn't posted earlier.
</p>

</div>
<a name="perlnut2-CHP-1-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.2. Frequently Asked Questions Lists (FAQs)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-15" />A FAQ is
a Frequently Asked Questions list, with answers. FAQs are
traditionally associated with Usenet newsgroups, but the term has
since been adopted by web sites, technical support departments, and
even health care pamphlets. In general, FAQs are written and
maintained on a volunteer basis by dedicated (and generous) members
of the community. The Perl FAQ is maintained by Tom Christiansen and
Nathan Torkington.
</p>

<p>The Perl FAQ was created to minimize traffic on the <em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.misc</em> newsgroup when it became
clear that the same questions were being asked over and over again.
However, the FAQ has transcended into a general-purpose starting
point for learning anything about Perl.
</p>

<p>The FAQ is distributed in several different formats, including HTML,
PostScript, and plain ASCII text. The main FAQ source is located at
<a href="../../../../../../www.perl.com/pub/q/faqs">http://www.perl.com/pub/q/faqs</a>.
You can also find it at <a href="../../../../../../perlfaq.cpan.org/">http://perlfaq.cpan.org/</a>, and the latest
version of the FAQ is posted on a semi-regular basis on <em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.misc</em>.
</p>

<p>In addition to the general Perl FAQ, there are also several niche
FAQs that are Perl-related. They are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Perl CGI Programming FAQ</i></dt>
<dd>
<a href="../../../../../../www.perl.com/CPAN-local/doc/FAQs/cgi/perl-cgi-faq.html">http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/doc/FAQs/cgi/perl-cgi-faq.html</a>
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Perl/Tk FAQ</i></dt>
<dd>
<a href="../../../../../../w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/ptkTOC.html">http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/ptkTOC.html</a>
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Perl for Win32 FAQ</i></dt>
<dd>
<a href="../../../../../../www.ActiveState.com/support/faqs/win32/">http://www.ActiveState.com/support/faqs/win32/</a>
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Perl for the Mac FAQ</i></dt>
<dd>
<a href="../../../../../../www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/FAQs/mac/MacPerlFAQ.html">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/FAQs/mac/MacPerlFAQ.html</a>
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>By no means should you consider this to be an exhaustive list. Also
check out appropriate mailing lists (see <a href="ch01_04.htm">Section 1.4.3, "Mailing Lists"</a>);
you'll find that many mailing lists also maintain
their own FAQs.
</p>

</div>
<a name="perlnut2-CHP-1-SECT-4.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.3. Mailing Lists</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-16" /><a name="INDEX-17" />Several mailing lists are
focused on more specialized aspects of Perl. Like Usenet newsgroups,
mailing lists are discussion groups, but the discussion takes place
over email. In general, mailing lists aren't as
convenient as newsgroups, since a few hundred mail messages a day
about Perl can become intrusive to any but the most obsessive Perl
hackers. However, because mailing lists tend to have much smaller and
more focused distributions, you'll find that they
can sometimes be much more interesting and helpful than newsgroups.
</p>

<p>There are tons of mailing lists for Perl users and developers alike.
Some are specific to a particular module or distribution, such as the
mailing lists for users of CGI.pm, LWP, DBI, or
<em class="emphasis">mod_perl</em>. Other mailing lists discuss using Perl
on non-Unix platforms such as Windows, Macintosh or VMS. Still more
mailing lists are devoted to the development and advocacy of Perl in
general.
</p>

<p>For a list of Perl-related mailing lists, refer to the Perl Mailing
List Database (<em class="emphasis">lists.cpan.org</em>) or
to the list maintained by the Perl Mongers at <a href="../../../../../../www.perl.org/support/mailing_lists.html">http://www.perl.org/support/mailing_lists.html</a>.
</p>

<p>Many of these mailing lists maintain a
"digest" version, which means that
instead of receiving individual email messages all day long, you
receive a few "digests" of the
messages on a regular basis. Digests of a mailing list might be
preferable to the minute-by-minute onslaught of email throughout the
day, depending on how involved you are in the discussion.

<a name="perlnut2-CHP-1-SECT-4.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.4. CPAN</h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-18" />Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
(CPAN) is a repository of Perl modules and scripts submitted by Perl
programs worldwide. It is by far the most valuable resource for Perl
programmers, so if you haven't browsed through CPAN,
go there now, and expect to stay a while. There are many mirrored
CPAN sites around the world, but the preferred entry point is
<a href="../../../../../../www.cpan.org/">www.cpan.org</a>.
</p>

</div>
<a name="perlnut2-CHP-1-SECT-4.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.5. www.perl.com</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-19" /><a name="INDEX-20" />There are countless web pages devoted to
Perl, but probably the most useful entry site to Perl resources is
<a href="../../../../../../www.perl.com/">www.perl.com</a>. Formerly maintained
by Tom Christiansen, <a href="../../../../../../www.perl.com/">www.perl.com</a>
is now maintained by O'Reilly &amp; Associates (the
publisher of this book). From <a href="../../../../../../www.perl.com/">www.perl.com</a>, you can access Perl
documentation, news, software, FAQs, articles, and (of course) Perl
itself.

<h3 class="sect2">1.4.6. Perl Mongers (<a href="www.perl.org">www.perl.org</a>)</h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-21" />Perl
Mongers is a nonprofit Perl advocacy organization that exists to
provide services to Perl user groups and to take the place of the now
defunct Perl Institute. If you live in a major city (in the United
States or abroad), it's likely that a Perl Mongers
group exists in your area. You can find out more about the Perl
Mongers by checkout out the main site at <a href="../../../../../../www.perl.org/">www.perl.org</a> or a description of user group
services at <a href="../../../../../../www.pm.org/">www.pm.org</a>.

<p>If you're curious about the location of a Perl
Mongers group, you should take a look at <a href="../../../../../../www.pm.org/groups.shtml">http://www.pm.org/groups.shtml</a>.

<h3 class="sect2">1.4.7. The Perl Journal</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-22" />The
<em class="emphasis">Perl Journal</em>, published by CMP, is a quarterly
publication with articles and news about Perl.
</p>

<p>If you're interested in reading past TPJ articles,
some highlights are being collated into book form (or, more
specifically, three-book form) and should be available by the time
you read this paragraph: <em class="emphasis">Perl Programming: Best of The Perl

<h3 class="sect2">1.4.8. Perl Conferences</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-23" />
<a name="INDEX-24" />For
years, Usenix has devoted tracks of its conferences to Perl. However,
today there are not just one but multiple conferences that focus on
Perl.
</p>

<p>In 1997, O'Reilly &amp; Associates began hosting The
Perl Conference (TPC), typically held during the third week of July
in a major California city. In recent years, The Perl Conference has
merged with a more general conference for open source technologies,
but the Perl track is by far the best attended. For more information,
go to <a href="../../../../../../conferences.oreilly.com/">http://conferences.oreilly.com/</a>.
</p>

<p>In 1999, a nonprofit organization called YAS (Yet Another Society)
started sponsoring a more grassroots, less corporate conference
called YAPC (Yet Another Perl Conference), typically held twice a
year in university settings. YAPC::America::North is held in the
United States or Canada in June, and YAPC::Europe is held in a major
European city in September. For more information, go to <a href="../../../../../../www.yapc.org/">http://www.yapc.org/</a>.

<a name="perlnut2-CHP-1-SECT-4.9" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.4.9. Books</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-25" /><a name="INDEX-26" />There are many books written on Perl. In
fact, the current popularity of Perl is often credited to the
original publication of <em class="emphasis"><a href="../prog/index.htm">Programming Perl</a></em>, also
known as "The Camel" (because of
the animal on its cover), by Larry Wall and Randal
Schwartz.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> The Camel is also
published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates. The Camel
isn't the best place to start if
you're just learning Perl from scratch, but
it's essential if you want to really understand Perl
and not just dabble in it.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-1" /><p> [1]The third and most recent edition of
<em class="emphasis">Programming Perl</em> is written by Larry Wall, Tom
Christiansen, and Jon Orwant.</p> </blockquote>
