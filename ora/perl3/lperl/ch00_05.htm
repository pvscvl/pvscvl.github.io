<h2 class="sect1">0.5. Acknowledgments</h2>




<p><b class="emphasis-bold">From Randal.</b> I want to thank the Stonehenge trainers past and present (Joseph
Hall, Tom Phoenix, Chip Salzenberg, <tt class="literal">brian d foy</tt>,
and Tad McClellan) for their willingness to go out and teach in front
of classrooms week after week and to come back with their notes about
what's working (and what's not) so we could fine-tune the
material for this book. I especially want to single out my co-author
and business associate, Tom Phoenix, for having spent many, many
hours working to improve Stonehenge's Llama course and to
provide the wonderful core text for most of this book.
</p>

<p>I also want to thank everyone at O'Reilly, especially our very
encouraging and patient editor, Linda Mui, and Tim O'Reilly
himself for taking a chance on me in the first place with the Camel
and Llama books.
</p>

<p>I am also absolutely indebted to the thousands of people who have
purchased the past editions of the Llama so that I could use the
money to stay "off the streets and out of jail," and to
those students in my classrooms who have trained me to be a better
trainer, and to the stunning array of Fortune 1000 clients who have
purchased our classes in the past and will continue to do so into the
future.
</p>

<p>As always, a special thanks to Lyle and Jack, for teaching me nearly
everything I know about writing. I won't ever forget you guys.
</p>



<p><b class="emphasis-bold">From Tom.</b> I've got to echo Randal's thanks to our editor, Linda
Mui, for her patience in pointing out which jokes and footnotes were
most excessive, while pointing out that she is in no way to blame for
the ones that remain. Both she and Randal have guided me through the
process of writing, and I am grateful.
</p>

<p>And another echo with regard to Randal and the other Stonehenge
trainers, who hardly ever complained when I unexpectedly updated the
course materials to try out a new teaching technique. You folks have
contributed many different viewpoints on teaching methods that I
would never have seen.
</p>

<p>For many years, I worked at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry
(OMSI), and I'd like to thank the folks there for letting me
hone my teaching skills as I learned to build a joke or two into
every activity, explosion, or dissection.
</p>

<p>To the many folks on Usenet who have given me your appreciation and
encouragement for my contributions there, thanks. As always, I hope
this helps.
</p>

<p>Of course, deep thanks are due especially to my co-author, Randal,
for giving me the freedom to try various ways of presenting the
material both in the classroom and here in the book, as well as for
the push to make this material into a book in the first place. And
without fail, I must say that I am indeed inspired by your on-going
work to ensure that no one else becomes ensnared by the legal
troubles that have stolen so much of your time and energy;
you're a fine example.
</p>



<p><b class="emphasis-bold">From Both of Us.</b> Thanks to our reviewers (Elaine Ashton, Kevin Bingham, Jarkko
Hietaniemi, Joe Johnston, and Ben Tilly) for providing comments on
the draft of this book.
</p>

<p>Thanks also to our many students who have let us know what parts of
the course material have needed improvement over the years.
It's because of you that we're both so proud of it today.
</p>

<p>Thanks to the many Perl Mongers who have made us feel at home as
we've visited your cities. Let's do it again sometime.
</p>

<p>And finally, our sincerest thanks to our friend Larry Wall, for
having the wisdom to share his really cool and powerful toys with the
rest of the world so that we can all get our work done just a little
bit faster, easier, and with more fun.
</p>
