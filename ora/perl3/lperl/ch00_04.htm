<h2 class="sect1">0.4. History of This Book</h2>

<p>For the curious, here's how Randal tells the story of how this
book came about:
</p>

<p>After I had finished the first <em class="citetitle">Programming
Perl</em> book with Larry <a name="INDEX-3" />Wall (in 1991), I was approached by Taos
Mountain Software in Silicon Valley to produce a training course.
This included having me deliver the first dozen or so courses and
train their staff to continue offering the course. I wrote the course
for them<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> and delivered it for them as promised.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-1" /><p>[1]In the contract, I retained the rights to
the exercises, hoping someday to reuse them in some other way, like
in the magazine columns I was writing at the time. The exercises are
the only things that lept from the Taos course to the book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the third or fourth delivery of that course (in late 1991),
someone came up to me and said, "you know, I really like
<em class="citetitle">Programming Perl</em>, but the way the material is
presented in this course is so much easier to follow -- you oughta
write a book like this course." It sounded like an opportunity
to me, so I started thinking about it.
</p>

<p>I wrote to Tim O'Reilly with a proposal based on an outline
that was similar to the course I was presenting for
Taos -- although I had rearranged and modified a few of the
chapters based on observations in the classroom. I think that was my
fastest proposal acceptance in history -- I got a message from Tim
within fifteen minutes saying "we've been waiting for you
to pitch a second book -- <em class="citetitle">Programming Perl</em>
is selling like gangbusters." That started the effort over the
next eighteen months to finish the first edition of
<em class="citetitle">Learning Perl</em>.
</p>

<p>During that time, I was starting to see an opportunity to teach Perl
classes outside Silicon Valley<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a>, so I created a class based on the text I was writing for
<em class="citetitle">Learning Perl</em>. I gave a dozen classes for
various clients (including my primary contractor, Intel Oregon), and
used the feedback to fine-tune the book draft even further.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-2" /><p>[2]My Taos contract had a
no-compete clause, so I had to stay out of Silicon Valley with any
similar courses, which I respected for many years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first edition hit the streets on the first day of November,
1993<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a> and became a smashing success, frequently
even outpacing <em class="citetitle">Programming Perl</em> book sales.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-3" /><p>[3]I remember that date very well, because it was
also the day I was arrested at my home for
computer-related-activities around my Intel contract, a series of
felony charges for which I was later convicted. The appeals battle
continues -- see <a href="../../../../../../www.lightlink.com/fors/">http://www.lightlink.com/fors/</a>for
details.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The back-cover jacket of the first book said "written by a
leading Perl trainer." Well, that became a self-fulfilling
prophesy. Within a few months, I was starting to get email from all
over the United States from people asking to have me teach at their
site. In the following seven years, my company became the leading
worldwide on-site Perl training company, and I had personally racked
up (literally) a million frequent-flier miles. It didn't hurt
that the Web started taking off about then, and the webmasters and
webmistresses picked Perl as the language of choice for content
management, interaction through CGI, and maintenance.
</p>

<p>For the past two years, I've been working closely with Tom
Phoenix in his role as lead trainer and content manager for
Stonehenge, giving him charter to experiment with the
"Llama" course by moving things around and breaking
things up. When we had come up with what we thought was the best
major revision of the course, I contacted O'Reilly and said
"it's time for a new book!" And now you're
reading it.
</p>

<p>Some of the differences you may notice from prior editions:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The text is completely new. Rather than simply copy-and-paste from
previous editions, we have derived the text from our Stonehenge
"Learning Perl" courseware and the instructor notes
we've created and road-tested. (Some of the exercises are
similar to the originals simply because we were using the prior
editions as our textbook until recently. But even those have mutated
during the rewrites.)
</p>
</li><li>
<p>We've broken the hard-to-swallow-all-at-once regular
expressions section into three easily digestible sections.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>We've created exercises with both Unix and Windows in mind.</p>
</li><li>
<p>We got rid of the artificial "control structures"
chapter, moving the <tt class="literal">while</tt> and
<tt class="literal">if</tt> statement earlier, and the
<tt class="literal">foreach</tt> and <tt class="literal">for</tt> loops later.
This gives us more useful examples and exercises for the scalars
chapter, for example.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>We moved subroutines much earlier to permit subsequent exercises to
use subroutines for the questions and answers.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>We now teach element syntax before the aggregate syntax for both
arrays and hashes. This has worked a bit of a miracle in the
classrooms, since it nearly always keeps beginners from the
all-too-common mistake of writing a slice where they mean an element.
At the risk of hubris, we'll admit that we expect other Perl
instructors and books to follow our lead here.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The exercises are more real-world and better paced.</p>
</li><li>
<p>We've included information on <tt class="literal">use strict</tt>,
warnings, and modules, although mostly as pointers for further
information.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>We've made the book much less addressed to the Unix system
administrator, and much more to the general programmer. The phrase
"like C" has been nearly completely eliminated.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The jokes are better. (We're constantly improvising jokes in
the classroom, and some of these end up as part of the standard
Stonehenge script. The best of <em class="emphasis">those</em> ended up
here. You should see what didn't make the cut!)
</p>
</li><li>
<p>We deeply regret that this edition lacks the wonderfully witty
Foreword, written by Larry Wall, who was busy defining Perl 6 as we
went to press. Larry is always supportive of our efforts, and we know
that he's still part of the book in spirit, if not in word, to
wish you the best as you start your holiday in the lustrous land of
Perl.
</p>
