<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>

<p>Welcome to the third edition of <em class="citetitle">Learning Perl</em>.</p>

<p>If you're looking for the best way to spend your first 30 to 45
hours with the Perl programming language, look no further. In the
pages that follow, you'll find a carefully paced introduction
to the language that remains the workhorse of the Internet, as well
as the language of choice for system administrators, web hackers, and
casual programmers around the world.
</p>

<p>We can't give you all of Perl in just a few hours. The books
that promise that are probably fibbing a bit. Instead, we've
carefully selected a complete and useful subset of Perl for you to
learn, good for programs from one to 128 lines long, which end up
being about 90% of the programs in use out there. And when
you're ready to go on, we've included a number of
pointers for further education.
</p>

<p>Each chapter is small enough to be read in an hour or two. Each
chapter ends with a series of exercises to help you practice what
you've just learned, with the answers in <a href="appa_01.htm">Appendix A, "Exercise Answers"</a> for your reference. Thus, this book is ideally
suited for a classroom "introduction to Perl" course. We
know this directly, because the material for this book was lifted
almost word-for-word from our flagship "Learning Perl"
course, delivered to thousands of students around the world. However,
we've designed the book for self-study as well.
</p>

<p>Although Perl lives as the "toolbox for Unix," you
don't have to be a Unix guru, or even a Unix user, to use this
book. Unless otherwise noted, everything we're saying applies
equally well to Windows ActivePerl from ActiveState, as well as to
the later releases of MacPerl for the Macintosh and pretty much every
other modern implementation of Perl.
</p>

<p>Although you don't need to know a single bit about Perl to
begin reading this book, we do recommend that you already have
familiarity with basic programming concepts such as variables, loops,
subroutines, and arrays, and the all-important "editing a
source code file with your favorite text editor." We
won't spend any time trying to explain those concepts. Although
we're pleased that we've had many reports of people
successfully picking up <em class="citetitle">Learning Perl</em> and
grasping Perl as their first programming language, of course we
can't promise the same results for everyone.

<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Typographical Conventions</h2>

<p>The following font conventions are used in this book:</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt class="literal">Constant width</tt></dt>
<dd>
is used for method names, function names, variables, and attributes.
It is also used for code examples.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><tt class="userinput"><b>Constant width bold</b></tt></dt>
<dd>
is used to indicate user input.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><tt><em class="replaceable">Constant width italic</em></tt></dt>
<dd>
is used to indicate a replaceable item in code (e.g.,
<em class="replaceable">filename</em>, where you are supposed to
substitute an actual filename).
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i>Italic</i></dt>
<dd>
is used for filenames, URLs, hostnames, commands in text, important
words on first mention, and emphasis.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Footnotes</dt>
<dd>
are used to attach parenthetical notes that you <em class="emphasis">should
not</em> read on your first (or perhaps second or third)
reading of this book. Sometimes lies are spoken to simplify the
presentation, and the footnotes restore the lie to truth. Often the
material in the footnote will be advanced material not even discussed
anywhere else in the book.
