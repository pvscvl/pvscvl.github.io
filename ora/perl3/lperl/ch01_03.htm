<h2 class="sect1">1.3. How Can I Get Perl?</h2>

<p>You probably already have it. At least, we find
<a name="INDEX-29" />Perl
wherever <em class="emphasis">we</em> go. It ships with many systems, and
system administrators often install it on every machine at their
site.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-20">[20]</a> But if you can't find
it already on your system, you can still get it for free.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-20" /><p>[20]Well, each machine that is made for
programming, at least.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Perl is distributed under two different <a name="INDEX-30" />
<a name="INDEX-31" />licenses. For most people, since
you'll merely be <em class="emphasis">using</em> it, either license
is as good as the other. If you'll be modifying Perl, however,
you'll want to read the licenses more closely, because they put
some small restrictions on distributing the modified code. For people
who won't modify Perl, the licenses essentially say
"it's free -- have fun with it."
</p>

<p>In fact, it's not only free, but it runs rather nicely on
nearly everything that calls itself Unix and has a C compiler. You
download it, type a command or two, and it starts configuring and
building itself. Or, better yet, you get your system administrator to
type those two commands and install it for you.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-21">[21]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-21" /><p>[21]If
system administrators can't install software, what good are
they? If you have trouble convincing your admin to install Perl,
offer to buy a pizza. We've never met a sys admin who could say
no to a free pizza, or at least counter-offer with something just as
easy to get.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Besides Unix and Unix-like systems, people have also been addicted
enough to Perl to port it to other systems, like the
Macintosh,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-22">[22]</a> VMS,
OS/2, even MS/DOS and every modern species of Windows -- and
probably even more by the time you read this.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-23">[23]</a> Many of these <em class="firstterm">ports</em>
of Perl come with an installation program that's even easier to
use than the process for installing Perl on Unix. Check for links in
the "ports" section on CPAN.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-22" /><p>[22]MacPerl runs under the
"classic" Mac OS. If you have Mac OS X, which is a
Unix-based system, you have mainstream Perl.</p> </blockquote><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-23" /><p>[23]And no,
as we write this, it won't fit in your Palm
handheld -- it's just too darn big, even stripped
down.</p> </blockquote>

<a name="lperl3-CHP-1-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.3.1. What Is CPAN?</h3>

<p><em class="firstterm">CPAN</em> is the <a name="INDEX-32" />
<a name="INDEX-33" />Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network, your one-stop shopping for Perl. It has the source
code for Perl itself, ready-to-install ports of Perl to all sorts of
non-Unix systems,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-24">[24]</a> examples, documentation,
extensions to Perl, and archives of messages about Perl. In short,
CPAN is comprehensive.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-24" /><p>[24]It's nearly always better to
compile Perl from the source on Unix systems. Other systems may not
have a C compiler and other tools needed for compilation, so CPAN has
binaries for these.</p> </blockquote>

<p>CPAN is replicated on hundreds of mirror machines around the world;
start at
<a name="INDEX-34" /><a href="../../../../../../www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a> to find one near you.
Most of the time, you can also simply visit <em class="emphasis">http://<tt class="literal">COUNTRYCODE</tt>.cpan.org/</em> where
<tt class="literal">COUNTRYCODE</tt> is your two-letter official country
code (like on the end of your national domain names). Or, if you
don't have access to the Net, you might find a CD-ROM or
DVD-ROM with all of the useful parts of CPAN on it; check with your
local technical bookstore. Look for a recently minted archive,
though; since CPAN changes daily, an archive from two years ago is an
antique. (Better yet, get a kind friend with Net access to burn you
one with today's CPAN.)
</p>

<p>CPAN is pretty-well organized; most of the time, you should find what
you want with just a few clicks of the mouse. But there's also
a couple of nice search interfaces on the Web
at<a name="INDEX-35" /> <a href="../../../../../../search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a> and <a href="../../../../../../kobesearch.cpan.org/">http://kobesearch.cpan.org/</a>,which are
especially helpful when you're looking for an extension to
Perl.
</p>

</div>
<a name="lperl3-CHP-1-SECT-3.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.3.2. How Can I Get Support for Perl?</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-36" /> <a name="INDEX-37" />Well, you get the complete source -- so
you get to fix the <a name="INDEX-38" />
<a name="INDEX-39" />bugs yourself!
</p>

<p>That doesn't sound so good, does it? But it really is a good
thing. Since there's no "source code escrow" on
Perl, anyone can fix a bug -- in fact, by the time you've
found and verified a bug, someone else has probably already got a fix
for it. There are thousands of people around the world who help to
maintain Perl.
</p>

<p>Now, we're not saying that Perl has a lot of bugs. But
it's a program, and every program has at least one
bug.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-25">[25]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-25" /><p>[25]Programmers also know that every program has at
least one line of unnecessary source code. By combining these two
rules and using logical induction, it's a simple matter to
prove that any program could be reduced to a single line of code with
a bug.</p> </blockquote>

<p>To see why it's so useful to have the source to Perl, imagine
that instead of using Perl, you licensed a programming language
called Forehead from a giant, powerful corporation owned by a
zillionaire with a bad haircut. (This is all hypothetical. Everyone
knows there's no such programming language as Forehead.) Now
think of what you can do when you find a bug in Forehead. First, you
can report it; second, you can hope -- hope that they fix the bug,
hope that they fix it <em class="emphasis">soon</em>, hope that they
won't charge too much for the new version. You can hope that
the new version doesn't add new features with new bugs, and
hope that the giant company doesn't get broken up in an
anti-trust lawsuit.
</p>

<p>But with Perl, you've got the source. In the rare and unlikely
event that you can't get a bug fixed any other way, you can
hire a programmer or ten and get to work. For that matter, if you buy
a new machine that Perl doesn't yet run on, you can port it
yourself. Or if you need a feature that doesn't yet exist,
well, you know what to do.
</p>

</div>
<a name="lperl3-CHP-1-SECT-3.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.3.3. Are There Any Other Kinds of Support?</h3>

<p>Sure; one of our favorites is the Perl Mongers. This is a worldwide
association of Perl users' groups; see <a href="../../../../../../www.pm.org/">http://www.pm.org/</a> for more information.
There's probably a group near you with an expert or someone who
knows an expert. If there's no group, you can easily start one.
</p>

<p>Of course, for the first line of support, you shouldn't neglect
the <a name="INDEX-40" />
<a name="INDEX-41" />documentation. Besides the
<a name="INDEX-42" />manpages<a href="#FOOTNOTE-26">[26]</a> themselves,
Perl's documentation includes the voluminous FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) and many tutorials.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-26" /><p>[26]The term <em class="firstterm">manpages </em>is a Unix-ism meaning
documentation. If you're not on a Unix system, the manpages for
Perl should be available via your system's native documentation
system. If you can't find them anywhere else, the manpages are
available directly on CPAN.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Another authoritative source is the book <em class="emphasis">Programming
Perl</em><a name="INDEX-43" />, commonly known as "the
<a name="INDEX-44" />Camel book"
because of its cover animal (just as this book has come to be known
as "the <a name="INDEX-45" />Llama book"). The Camel book contains
the complete reference information, some tutorial stuff, and a bunch
of miscellaneous information about Perl. There's also a
separate pocket-sized <a name="INDEX-46" />quick reference to Perl (by Johan
<a name="INDEX-47" />Vromans)
that's handy to keep at hand (or in your pocket).
</p>

<p>If you need to ask a question of someone, there are
<a name="INDEX-48" />newsgroups on Usenet and any number of
<a name="INDEX-49" />
<a name="INDEX-50" />mailing lists.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-27">[27]</a> At
any hour of the day or night, there's a Perl expert awake in
some timezone answering questions on Usenet's Perl
newsgroups -- the sun never sets on the Perl empire. This means
that if you ask a question, you'll often get an answer within
minutes. If you didn't check the documentation and FAQ first,
you'll get flamed within minutes.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-27" /><p>[27]Many mailing lists are listed at <a href="../../../../../../lists.perl.org/">http://lists.perl.org</a>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>We generally recommend the newsgroup
<em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.moderated</em><a name="INDEX-51" />, where (as the name implies) a
moderator will check over your question before posting it. If
there's something wrong with your question, you'll still
get flamed of course, but it's a small, private flame in email
rather than a big public one in a newsgroup.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-28">[28]</a> But for
most questions, you'll get an answer back within the hour. Just
try getting that level of support from your favorite software vendor
for free!
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-28" /><p>[28]Of
course, we're joking here. Unless you've done something
amazingly boneheaded, the moderators are all kind, polite, helpful
folks, who will gently point you in the direction of the information
you need, with just enough flame to remind you to be more careful
next time. Don't be afraid to ask.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The official Perl newsgroups on Usenet are located in the
<em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.*</em> part of the hierarchy. As of
this writing, there are five of them, but they change from time to
time. You (or whoever is in charge of Perl at your site) should
generally subscribe to <em class="emphasis">comp.lang.perl.announce,</em>
which is a low-volume newsgroup just for important announcements
about Perl, including especially any security-related announcements.
Ask your local expert if you need help with Usenet.
</p>

<p>Also, a few web communities have sprung up around Perl discussions.
One very popular one, known as The <a name="INDEX-52" />
<a name="INDEX-53" />Perl Monastery (<a href="../../../../../../www.perlmonks.org/">http://www.perlmonks.org</a>) has seen quite a
bit of participation from many Perl book and column authors,
including at least one of the authors of this book.
</p>

<p>If you find yourself needing a support contract for Perl, there are a
number of firms who are willing to charge as much as you'd
like. In most cases, these other support avenues will take care of
you for free.<a name="INDEX-54" /> <a name="INDEX-55" /> 
</p>

</div>
<a name="lperl3-CHP-1-SECT-3.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.3.4. What If I Find a Bug in Perl?</h3>

<p>The first thing to do when you find a bug is to check the
documentation<a href="#FOOTNOTE-29">[29]</a> again.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-30">[30]</a> Perl has so many special features and
exceptions to rules that you may have discovered a feature, not a
bug. Also, check that you don't have an older version of Perl;
maybe you found something that's been fixed in a more recent
version.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-29" /><p>[29]Even Larry admits to consulting the
documentation from time to time.</p> </blockquote><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-30" /><p>[30]Maybe even twice or three times. Many times, we've gone
into the documentation looking to explain a particular unexpected
behavior and found some new little nuance that ends up on a slide or
in a column.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Once you're 99% certain that you've found a real bug, ask
around. Ask someone at work, at your local Perl Mongers'
meeting, or at a Perl conference. Chances are, it's
<em class="emphasis">still</em> a feature, not a bug.
</p>

<p>Once you're 100% certain that you've found a real bug,
cook up a test case (if you haven't done so already). The ideal
test case is a tiny self-contained program that any Perl user could
run to see the same (mis-)behavior as you've found. Once
you've got a test case that clearly shows the bug, use the
<i class="command">perlbug</i><a name="INDEX-56" /> <a name="INDEX-57" />
<a name="INDEX-58" />
<a name="INDEX-59" />
<a name="INDEX-60" /> utility (which comes with Perl) to
report the bug. That will normally send email from you to the Perl
developers, so don't use <i class="command">perlbug</i> until
you've got your test case ready.
</p>

<p>Once you've sent off your bug report, if you've done
everything right, it's not unusual to get a response within
minutes. Typically, you can apply a simple patch and get right back
to work. Of course, you may (at worst) get no response at all; the
Perl developers are under no obligation to even read your bug
reports. But all of us love Perl, so nobody likes to let a bug escape
our notice.
