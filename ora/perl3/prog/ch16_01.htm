Computer processes have almost as many ways of communicating as people
do.  The difficulties of interprocess communication should not be
underestimated.  It doesn't do you any good to listen for verbal cues
when your friend is using only body language.  Likewise, two processes
can communicate only when they agree on the means of communication, and
on the conventions built on top of that.  As with any kind of
communication, the conventions to be agreed upon range from lexical to
pragmatic: everything from which lingo you'll use, up to whose turn it
is to talk.  These conventions are necessary because it's very difficult
to communicate bare semantics in the absence of context.</p>

<p>In our lingo, interprocess communication is usually pronounced IPC.
The IPC facilities of Perl range from the very simple to the very
complex.  Which facility you should use depends on the complexity of
the information to be communicated.  The simplest kind of information
is almost no information at all: just the awareness that a
particular event has happened at a particular point in time.  In Perl,
these events are communicated via a signal mechanism modeled on the
Unix signal system.
<a name="INDEX-2875"></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2876"></a>
At the other extreme, the socket facilities of Perl allow you to
communicate with any other process on the Internet using any mutually
supported protocol you like.  Naturally, this freedom comes at a price:
you have to go through a number of steps to set up the connections and
make sure you're talking the same language as the process on the other
end.  This may in turn require you to adhere to any number of other
strange customs, depending on local conventions.  To be
protocoligorically correct, you might even be required to speak a
language like XML, or Java, or Perl.  Horrors.
<a name="INDEX-2877"></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2878"></a>
Sandwiched in between are some facilities intended primarily for
communicating with processes on the same machine.  These include good
old-fashioned files, pipes, FIFOs, and the various System V IPC
syscalls.  Support for these facilities varies across platforms;
modern Unix systems (including Apple's Mac OS X) should support all of
them, and, except for signals and SysV IPC, most of the rest are
supported on any recent Microsoft operating systems, including pipes,
forking, file locking, and sockets.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a><a name="INDEX-2879"></a><a name="INDEX-2880"></a>

<h2 class="sect1">16.1. Signals</h2>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2886"></a><a name="INDEX-2887"></a><a name="INDEX-2888"></a><a name="INDEX-2889"></a><a name="INDEX-2890"></a><a name="INDEX-2891"></a>
Perl uses a simple signal-handling model: the <tt class="literal">%SIG</tt>
hash contains references (either symbolic or hard) to user-defined
signal handlers.  Certain events cause the operating system to deliver
a signal to the affected process.  The handler corresponding to that
event is called with one argument containing the name of the signal
that triggered it.  To send a signal to another process, you use the
<tt class="literal">kill</tt> function.  Think of it as sending a one-bit
piece of information to the other process.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a> If that process has installed a signal handler for
that signal, it can execute code when it receives the signal.  But
there's no way for the sending process to get any sort of return
value, other than knowing that the signal was legally sent.  The
sender receives no feedback saying what, if anything, the receiving
process did with the signal.</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-2"></a>
<p>[2] Actually,
it's more like five or six bits, depending on how many signals your OS
defines and on whether the other process makes use of the fact that
you <em class="emphasis">didn't</em> send a different signal.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2892"></a><a name="INDEX-2893"></a><a name="INDEX-2894"></a><a name="INDEX-2895"></a>
We've classified this facility as a form of IPC, but in fact, signals
can come from various sources, not just other processes.  A signal
might also come from your own process, or it might be generated
when the user at the keyboard types a particular sequence like
Control-C or Control-Z, or it might be manufactured by the kernel when
a special event transpires, such as when a child process exits,
or when your process runs out of stack space or hits
a file size or memory limit.  But your own process can't easily
distinguish among these cases.  A signal is like a package that
arrives mysteriously on your doorstep with no return address.  You'd
best open it carefully.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2896"></a><a name="INDEX-2897"></a><a name="INDEX-2898"></a>
Since entries in the <tt class="literal">%SIG</tt> array can be hard references, it's
common practice to use anonymous functions for simple signal handlers:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">$SIG{INT}  = sub { die "\nOutta here!\n" };
$SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "Your alarm clock went off" };</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-2899"></a><a name="INDEX-2900"></a><a name="INDEX-2901"></a><a name="INDEX-2902"></a>
Or you could create a named function and assign its name or reference
to the appropriate slot in the hash.  For example, to intercept
interrupt and quit signals (often bound to Control-C and Control-\ on
your keyboard), set up a handler like this:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">sub catch_zap {
    my $signame = shift;
    our $shucks++;
    die "Somebody sent me a SIG$signame!";
} 
$shucks = 0;
$SIG{INT} = 'catch_zap';   # always means &amp;main::catch_zap
$SIG{INT} = \&amp;catch_zap;   # best strategy
$SIG{QUIT} = \&amp;catch_zap;  # catch another, too</pre>
</blockquote>

Notice how all we do in the signal handler is set a global variable
and then raise an exception with <tt class="literal">die</tt>.  Whenever
possible, try to avoid anything more complicated than that, because on
most systems the C library is not re-entrant.  Signals are delivered
asynchronously,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a>
so calling any <tt class="literal">print</tt> functions (or even anything
that needs to <em class="emphasis">malloc</em>(3) more memory)
could in theory trigger a memory fault and subsequent core dump if you
were already in a related C library routine when the signal was
delivered.  (Even the <tt class="literal">die</tt> routine is a bit unsafe
unless the process is executing within an <tt class="literal">eval</tt>,
which suppresses the I/O from <tt class="literal">die</tt>, which keeps it
from calling the C library.  Probably.)
<a name="INDEX-2903"></a><a name="INDEX-2904"></a><a name="INDEX-2905"></a><a name="INDEX-2906"></a>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-3"></a>
<p>[3]Synchronizing signal delivery with
Perl-level opcodes is scheduled for a future release of Perl, which
should solve the matter of signals and core dumps.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2907"></a><a name="INDEX-2908"></a><a name="INDEX-2909"></a>
An even easier way to trap signals is to use the
<tt class="literal">sigtrap</tt> pragma to install simple, default signal
handlers:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">use sigtrap qw(die INT QUIT);
use sigtrap qw(die untrapped normal-signals 
   stack-trace any error-signals);</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-2910"></a>
The pragma is useful when you don't want to bother writing your own
handler, but you still want to catch dangerous signals and perform an
orderly shutdown.  By default, some of these signals are so fatal to
your process that your program will just stop in its tracks when it
receives one.  Unfortunately, that means that any
<tt class="literal">END</tt> functions for at-exit handling and
<tt class="literal">DESTROY</tt> methods for object finalization are not
called.  But they <em class="emphasis">are</em> called on ordinary Perl
exceptions (such as when you call <tt class="literal">die</tt>), so you can
use this pragma to painlessly convert the signals into exceptions.
Even though you aren't dealing with the signals yourself, your program
still behaves correctly.  See the description of <tt class="literal">use
sigtrap</tt> in <a href="ch31_01.htm">Chapter 31, "Pragmatic Modules"</a>,
for many more features of this pragma.<p></p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2911"></a><a name="INDEX-2912"></a>
You may also set the <tt class="literal">%SIG</tt> handler to either of the
strings "<tt class="literal">IGNORE</tt>" or "<tt class="literal">DEFAULT</tt>",
in which case Perl will try to discard the signal or allow the default
action for that signal to occur (though some signals can be neither
trapped nor ignored, such as the <tt class="literal">KILL</tt> and
<tt class="literal">STOP</tt> signals; see
<em class="emphasis">signal</em>(3), if you have it, for a list of
signals available on your system and their default behaviors).
<a name="INDEX-2913"></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2914"></a><a name="INDEX-2915"></a>
The operating system thinks of signals as numbers rather than names,
but Perl, like most people, prefers symbolic names to magic numbers.
To find the names of the signals, list out the keys of the
<tt class="literal">%SIG</tt> hash, or use the <em class="emphasis">kill -l</em>
command if you have one on your system.  You can also use Perl's
standard <tt class="literal">Config</tt> module to determine your operating
system's mapping between signal names and signal numbers.  See
<em class="emphasis">Config</em>(3) for an example of this.
<a name="INDEX-2916"></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2917"></a><a name="INDEX-2918"></a>
Because <tt class="literal">%SIG</tt> is a global hash, assignments to it
affect your entire program.  It's often more considerate to the rest
of your program to confine your signal catching to a restricted scope.
Do this with a <tt class="literal">local</tt> signal handler assignment,
which goes out of effect once the enclosing block is exited.  (But
remember that <tt class="literal">local</tt> values are visible in functions
called from within that block.)
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">{  
    local $SIG{INT} = 'IGNORE'; 
    ...     # Do whatever you want here, ignoring all SIGINTs.
    fn();   # SIGINTs ignored inside fn() too!
    ...     # And here.
}           # Block exit restores previous $SIG{INT} value.

fn();       # SIGINTs not ignored inside fn() (presumably).</pre>

<h3 class="sect2">16.1.1. Signaling Process Groups</h3>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2920"></a><a name="INDEX-2921"></a><a name="INDEX-2922"></a><a name="INDEX-2923"></a>
Processes (under Unix, at least) are organized into process groups,
generally corresponding to an entire job.  For example, when you fire
off a single shell command that consists of a series of filter
commands that pipe data from one to the other, those processes (and
their child processes) all belong to the same process group.  That
process group has a number corresponding to the process number of the
process group leader.  If you send a signal to a positive process
number, it just sends the signal to the process, but if you send a
signal to a negative number, it sends that signal to every process
whose process group number is the corresponding positive number, that
is, the process number of the process group leader.  (Conveniently for
the process group leader, the process group ID is just
<tt class="literal">$$</tt>.)</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2924"></a>
Suppose your program wants to send a hang-up signal to all child
processes it started directly, plus any grandchildren started by those
children, plus any greatgrandchildren started by those grandchildren,
and so on.  To do this, your program first calls
<tt class="literal">setpgrp(0,0)</tt> to become the leader of a new process
group, and any processes it creates will be part of the new group.  It
doesn't matter whether these processes were started manually via
<tt class="literal">fork</tt>, automaticaly via piped
<tt class="literal">open</tt>s, or as backgrounded jobs with
<tt class="literal">system("cmd &amp;")</tt>.  Even if those
processes had children of their own, sending a hang-up signal to your
entire process group will find them all (except for processes that
have set their own process group or changed their UID to give
themselves diplomatic immunity to your signals).
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">{
    local $SIG{HUP} = 'IGNORE';   # exempt myself
    kill(HUP, -$$);               # signal my own process group
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-2925"></a><a name="INDEX-2926"></a>
<p></p>

<p>Another interesting signal is signal number <tt class="literal">0</tt>.  This
doesn't actually affect the target process, but instead checks
that it's alive and hasn't changed its UID.  That is, it checks
whether it's legal to send a signal, without actually sending one.
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">unless (kill 0 =&gt; $kid_pid) {
    warn "something wicked happened to $kid_pid";
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-2927"></a><a name="INDEX-2928"></a>
Signal number <tt class="literal">0</tt> is the only signal that works the
same under Microsoft ports of Perl as it does in Unix.  On Microsoft
systems, <tt class="literal">kill</tt> does not actually deliver a signal.
Instead, it forces the target process to exit with the status
indicated by the signal number.  This may be fixed someday.  The magic
<tt class="literal">0</tt> signal, however, still behaves in the standard,
nondestructive fashion.<p></p>






<h3 class="sect2">16.1.2. Reaping Zombies</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2929"></a><a name="INDEX-2930"></a><a name="INDEX-2931"></a><a name="INDEX-2932"></a>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-2933"></a><a name="INDEX-2934"></a>
When a process exits, its parent is sent a <tt class="literal">CHLD</tt>
signal by the kernel and the process becomes a zombie<a href="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a> until the
parent calls <tt class="literal">wait</tt> or <tt class="literal">waitpid</tt>.
If you start another process in Perl using anything except
<tt class="literal">fork</tt>, Perl takes care of reaping your zombied
children, but if you use a raw <tt class="literal">fork</tt>, you're
expected to clean up after yourself.  On many but not all kernels, a
simple hack for autoreaping zombies is to set
<tt class="literal">$SIG{CHLD}</tt> to <tt class="literal">'IGNORE'</tt>.  A more
flexible (but tedious) approach is to reap them yourself.  Because

more than one child may have died before you get around to dealing
with them, you must gather your zombies in a loop until there aren't
any more:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">use POSIX ":sys_wait_h";
sub REAPER { 1 until waitpid(-1, WNOHANG) == -1) }</pre>
</blockquote>

To run this code as needed, you can either set a <tt class="literal">CHLD</tt> signal
handler for it:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">$SIG{CHLD} = \&amp;REAPER;</pre>
</blockquote>

or, if you're running in a loop, just arrange to call the reaper
every so often.  This is the best approach because it isn't subject
to the occasional core dump that signals can sometimes trigger in
the C library.  However, it's expensive if called in a tight loop, so a
reasonable compromise is to use a hybrid strategy where you minimize
the risk within the handler by doing as little as possible and 
waiting until outside to reap zombies:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">our $zombies = 0;
$SIG{CHLD} = sub { $zombies++ };  
sub reaper {
    my $zombie;
    our %Kid_Status;  # store each exit status
    $zombies = 0;  
    while (($zombie = waitpid(-1, WNOHANG)) != -1) {
        $Kid_Status{$zombie} = $?;
    } 
}
while (1) {
    reaper() if $zombies;
    ...
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-2935"></a><a name="INDEX-2936"></a><a name="INDEX-2937"></a>
This code assumes your kernel supports reliable signals.  Old SysV
traditionally didn't, which made it impossible to write correct
signal handlers there.  Ever since way back in the 5.003 release,
Perl has used the <em class="emphasis">sigaction</em>(2) syscall where available, which is a lot
more dependable.  This means that unless you're running on an ancient
operating system or with an ancient Perl, you won't have to reinstall
your handlers and risk missing signals.  Fortunately, all BSD-flavored
systems (including Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X) plus all POSIX-compliant
systems provide reliable signals, so the old broken SysV behavior
is more a matter of historical note than of current concern.
<a name="INDEX-2938"></a>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-4"></a>
<p>[4]Yes, that really is the technical term.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2939"></a>
With these newer kernels, many other things will work
better, too.  For example, "slow" syscalls (those that can block,
like <tt class="literal">read</tt>, <tt class="literal">wait</tt>, and <tt class="literal">accept</tt>) will restart
automatically if interrupted by a signal.  In the bad old days,
user code had to remember to check explicitly whether each slow
syscall failed with <tt class="literal">$!</tt> (<tt class="literal">$ERRNO</tt>) set to <tt class="literal">EINTR</tt> and, if so, restart.   This wouldn't happen just from <tt class="literal">INT</tt> signals; even innocuous
signals like <tt class="literal">TSTP</tt> (from a Control-Z) or <tt class="literal">CONT</tt> (from foregrounding the
job) would abort the syscall.  Perl now restarts the syscall for you
automatically if the operating system allows it to.  This is
generally construed to be a feature.</p>

<p>You can check whether you have the more rigorous POSIX-style signal
behavior by loading the <tt class="literal">Config</tt> module and checking
whether <tt class="literal">$Config{d_sigaction}</tt> has a true value.  To find out
whether slow syscalls are restartable, check your system documentation
on <em class="emphasis">sigaction</em>(2) or <em class="emphasis">sigvec</em>(3), or scrounge around your C
<em class="emphasis">sys/signal.h</em> file for <tt class="literal">SV_INTERRUPT</tt> or <tt class="literal">SA_RESTART</tt>.  If one
or both symbols are found, you probably have restartable syscalls.</p>






<h3 class="sect2">16.1.3. Timing Out Slow Operations</h3>

<a name="INDEX-2940"></a><a name="INDEX-2941"></a><a name="INDEX-2942"></a>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-2943"></a>
A common use for signals is to impose time limits on long-running
operations.  If you're on a Unix system (or any other POSIX-conforming
system that supports the <tt class="literal">ALRM</tt> signal), you can ask the kernel
to send your process an <tt class="literal">ALRM</tt> at some point in the future:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">use Fcntl ':flock';
eval { 
    local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "alarm clock restart" };
    alarm 10;               # schedule alarm in 10 seconds 
    eval { 
        flock(FH, LOCK_EX)  # a blocking, exclusive lock
            or die "can't flock: $!";
    };
    alarm 0;                # cancel the alarm
};
alarm 0;               # race condition protection
die if $@ &amp;&amp; $@ !~ /alarm clock restart/; # reraise</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name="INDEX-2944"></a>
If the alarm hits while you're waiting for the lock, and you simply
catch the signal and return, you'll go right back into the <tt class="literal">flock</tt>
because Perl automatically restarts syscalls where it can.
The only way out is to raise an exception through <tt class="literal">die</tt> and then
let <tt class="literal">eval</tt> catch it.  (This works because the exception winds up
calling the C library's <em class="emphasis">longjmp</em>(3) function, which is what really
gets you out of the restarting syscall.)<p></p>

<p>The nested exception trap is included because calling <tt class="literal">flock</tt> would raise
an exception if <tt class="literal">flock</tt> is not implemented on your platform, and you need
to make sure to clear the alarm anyway.  The second <tt class="literal">alarm 0</tt> is provided in case the signal comes in after running the <tt class="literal">flock</tt> but before
getting to the first <tt class="literal">alarm 0</tt>.   Without the second <tt class="literal">alarm</tt>, you would
risk a tiny race condition--but size doesn't matter in race conditions;
they either exist or they don't.  And we prefer that they don't.</p>






<h3 class="sect2">16.1.4. Blocking Signals</h3>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2945"></a><a name="INDEX-2946"></a><a name="INDEX-2947"></a><a name="INDEX-2948"></a>
Now and then, you'd like to delay receipt of a signal during some
critical section of code.  You don't want to blindly ignore the
signal, but what you're doing is too important to interrupt.  Perl's
<tt class="literal">%SIG</tt> hash doesn't implement signal blocking, but the <tt class="literal">POSIX</tt>
module does, through its interface to the <em class="emphasis">sigprocmask</em>(2) syscall:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">use POSIX qw(:signal_h);
$sigset   = POSIX::SigSet-&gt;new; 
$blockset = POSIX::SigSet-&gt;new(SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGCHLD);       
sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, $blockset, $sigset) 
    or die "Could not block INT,QUIT,CHLD signals: $!\n";</pre>
</blockquote>

Once the three signals are all blocked, you can do whatever you want
without fear of being bothered.  When you're done with
your critical section, unblock the signals by restoring the old signal mask:  
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, $sigset)
    or die "Could not restore INT,QUIT,CHLD signals: $!\n";</pre>
</blockquote>

If any of the three signals came in while blocked, they are delivered
immediately.  If two or more different signals are pending, the
order of delivery is not defined.  Additionally, no distinction is
made between having received a particular signal once while blocked
and having received it many times.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a> For
example, if nine child processes exited while you were blocking
<tt class="literal">CHLD</tt> signals, your handler (if you had one) would still be called
only once after you unblocked.  That's why, when you reap zombies,
you should always loop until they're all gone.<p></p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-5"></a>
<p>[5] Traditionally, that is. Countable signals may be implemented on some real-time systems according
to the latest specs, but we haven't seen these yet.</p>
