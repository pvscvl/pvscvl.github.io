<h2 class="sect1">27.2. Perl Poetry</h2>

<a name="INDEX-4385"></a>
<p>The forgery in the attendant sidebar appeared on Usenet on April Fool's
Day, 1990. It is presented here without comment, merely to show how
disgusting the metaphors of a typical programming language really are.
So much for anything  resembling literary value. Larry is particularly
relieved that "Black Perl", originally written for Perl 3, no longer
parses under Perl 5.</p>

<p>Larry's, er, corpus has fortunately been overshadowed by that of the
reigning Perl Poet, Sharon Hopkins.  She has written quite a few Perl
poems, as well as a paper on Perl poetry that she presented at the
Usenix Winter 1992 Technical Conference, entitled "Camels and Needles:
Computer Poetry Meets the Perl Programming Language".  (The paper is
available as <em class="emphasis">misc/poetry.ps</em> on CPAN.)  Besides being the most
prolific Perl poet,  Sharon is also the most widely published, having
had the following poem published in both the <em class="emphasis">Economist</em> and the
<em class="emphasis">Guardian</em>:</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">#!/usr/bin/perl

APPEAL:

listen (please, please);

open yourself, wide;
    join (you, me),
connect (us,together),

tell me.

do something if distressed;

    @dawn, dance;
    @evening, sing;
    read (books,$poems,stories) until peaceful;
    study if able;

    write me if-you-please;

sort your feelings, reset goals, seek (friends, family, anyone);

        do*not*die (like this)
        if sin abounds;

keys (hidden), open (locks, doors), tell secrets;
do not, I-beg-you, close them, yet.

                            accept (yourself, changes),
                            bind (grief, despair);

require truth, goodness if-you-will, each moment;

select (always), length(of-days)

It has come to my attention that there is a crying need for a place for people to express both their emotional 
and technical natures simultaneously. Several people have sent me some items which don't fit into any 
newsgroup. Perhaps it's because I recently posted to both comp.lang.perl and to rec.arts.poems, but people 
seem to be writing poems in Perl, and they're asking me where they should post them. Here is a sampling:

From a graduate student (in finals week), the following haiku:</pre>

<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">study, write, study,
do review (each word) if time.
close book. sleep? what's that?</pre>

<pre class="programlisting">And someone writing from Fort Lauderdale writes:</pre>

<pre class="programlisting">sleep, close together,
sort of sin each spring &amp; wait;
50% die</pre>

<pre class="programlisting">A person who wishes to remain anonymous wrote the following example of "Black Perl".  (The Pearl poet 
would have been shocked, no doubt.)</pre>

<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">BEFOREHAND: close door, each window &amp; exit;  wait until time.
    open spellbook, study, read (scan, select, tell us);
write it, print the hex while each watches,
    reverse its length, write again;
    kill spiders, pop them, chop, split, kill them.
       unlink arms, shift, wait &amp; listen (listening, wait),
sort the flock (then, warn the "goats" &amp; kill the "sheep");
    kill them, dump qualms, shift moralities,
    values aside, each one;
        die sheep! die to reverse the system
        you accept (reject, respect);
next step,
    kill the next sacrifice, each sacrifice,
    wait, redo ritual until "all the spirits are pleased";
    do it ("as they say").
do it(*everyone***must***participate***in***forbidden**s*e*x*).
return last victim; package body;
    exit crypt (time, times &amp; "half a time") &amp; close it,
    select (quickly) &amp; warn your next victim;
AFTERWORDS: tell nobody.
    wait, wait until time;

<pre class="programlisting">I tried that, and it actually parses in Perl.  It doesn't appear to do anything useful, however.  I think I'm glad, 
actually... I hereby propose the creation of comp.lang.perl.poems as a place for such items, so we don't clutter 
the perl or poems newsgroups with things that may be of interest to neither.  Or, alternately, we should 
create rec.arts.poems.perl for items such as those above which merely parse, and don't do anything useful.  
(There is precedent in rec.arts.poems, after all.)  Then also create comp.lang.perl.poems for poems that 
actually do something, such as this haiku of my own:</pre>
