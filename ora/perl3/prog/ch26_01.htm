<a name="INDEX-4372"></a><a name="INDEX-4373"></a>
<p>One of the principles underlying Perl's design is that simple things
should be simple, and hard things should be possible.  Documentation
should be simple.</p>

<p>Perl supports a simple text markup format called <em class="emphasis">pod</em> that can
stand on its own or be freely intermixed with your source code to create
embedded documentation.  Pod can be converted to many other formats for
printing or viewing, or you can just read it directly, because it's
plain.</p>

<p>Pod is not as expressive as languages like XML, [LaTeX], <em class="emphasis">troff</em>(1), or
even HTML.  This is intentional: we sacrificed that expressiveness for
simplicity and convenience.  Some text markup languages make authors
write more markup than text, which makes writing harder than it has to
be, and reading next to impossible.  A good format, like a good movie
score, stays in the background without causing distraction.</p>

<p>Getting programmers to write documentation is almost as hard as getting
them to wear ties.  Pod was designed to be so easy to write that even a
programmer could do it--and would.  We don't claim that pod is
sufficient for writing a book, although it was sufficient for writing
this one.</p>


<h2 class="sect1">26.1. Pod in a Nutshell</h2>

<a name="INDEX-4374"></a>
<p>Most document formats require the entire document to be in that
format.  Pod is more forgiving: you can embed pod in any sort of
file, relying on <em class="emphasis">pod translators</em> to extract the pod.  Some files consist entirely of 100% pure pod.  But other files, notably
Perl programs and modules, may contain dollops of pod sprinkled
about wherever the author feels like it.  Perl simply skips over
the pod text when parsing the file for execution.</p>

<p>The Perl lexer knows to begin skipping when, at a spot where it would
ordinarily find a statement, it instead encounters a line
beginning with an equal sign and an identifier, like this:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">=head1 Here There Be Pods!</pre>
</blockquote>

That text, along with all remaining text up through and including a line
beginning with <tt class="literal">=cut</tt>, will be ignored.  This allows you to intermix
your source code and your documentation freely, as in:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">=item snazzle

The snazzle() function will behave in the most spectacular
form that you can possibly imagine, not even excepting
cybernetic pyrotechnics.

=cut

sub snazzle {
    my $arg = shift;
    ....
}

=item razzle

The razzle() function enables autodidactic epistemology generation.

=cut

sub razzle {
    print "Epistemology generation unimplemented on this platform.\n";
}</pre>
</blockquote>

For more examples, look at any standard or CPAN Perl module.
They're all supposed to come with pod, and nearly all do, except for
the ones that don't.<p></p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-4375"></a>
Since pod is recognized by the Perl lexer and thrown out, you may also
use an appropriate pod directive to quickly comment out an arbitrarily
large section of code.  Use a <tt class="literal">=for</tt> pod block to
comment out one paragraph, or a
<tt class="literal">=begin</tt>/<tt class="literal">=end</tt> pair for a larger
section.  We'll cover the syntax of those pod directives later.
Remember, though, that in both cases, you're still in pod mode
afterwards, so you need to <tt class="literal">=cut</tt> back to the
compiler.
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">print "got 1\n";

=for commentary
This paragraph alone is ignored by anyone except the
mythical "commentary" translator.  When it's over, you're
still in pod mode, not program mode.
print "got 2\n";


=cut

# ok, real program again
print "got 3\n";

=begin comment 

print "got 4\n";

all of this stuff
here will be ignored
by everyone

print "got 5\n";

=end comment 

=cut

print "got 6\n";</pre>
</blockquote>

This will print out that it got <tt class="literal">1</tt>, <tt class="literal">3</tt>, and <tt class="literal">6</tt>.  Remember that
these pod directives can't go just anywhere.  You have to put them
only where the parser is expecting to see a new statement, not just in
the middle of an expression or at other arbitrary locations.<p></p>

<p>From the viewpoint of Perl, all pod markup is thrown out, but from
the viewpoint of pod translators, it's the code that is thrown out.
Pod translators view the remaining text as a sequence of paragraphs
separated by blank lines.  All modern pod translators parse pod the
same way, using the standard <tt class="literal">Pod::Parser</tt> module.  They differ only
in their output, since each translator specializes in one output
format.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of paragraphs: verbatim paragraphs, command
paragraphs, and prose paragraphs.</p>


<h3 class="sect2">26.1.1. Verbatim Paragraphs</h3>

<p>Verbatim paragraphs are used for literal text that you want to
appear as is, such as snippets of code.  A verbatim paragraph must
be indented; that is, it must begin with a space or tab character.  The
translator should reproduce it exactly, typically in a constant
width font, with tabs assumed to be on eight-column boundaries.  There
are no special formatting escapes, so you can't play font games to
italicize or embolden.  A <tt class="literal">&lt;</tt> character means a literal <tt class="literal">&lt;</tt>, and nothing else.</p>






<h3 class="sect2">26.1.2. Pod Directives</h3>

<a name="INDEX-4376"></a><a name="INDEX-4377"></a><a name="INDEX-4378"></a>
<p>All pod directives start with <tt class="literal">=</tt> followed by an identifier.  This may
be followed by any amount of arbitrary text that the directive can use
however it pleases.  The only syntactic requirement is that the text must all be
one paragraph.  Currently recognized directives (sometimes called <em class="emphasis">pod
commands</em>) are:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">=head1</tt></b>
</dt>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">=head2</tt></b>
</dt>
<dt>
<b>...</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <tt class="literal">=head1</tt>, <tt class="literal">=head2</tt>,... directives produce headings at the level
specified.  The rest of the text in the paragraph is treated as the
heading description.  These are similar to the <tt class="literal">.SH</tt> and <tt class="literal">.SS</tt>
section and subsection headers in <em class="emphasis">man</em>(7), or to <tt class="literal">&lt;H1&gt;</tt>...<tt class="literal">&lt;/H1&gt;</tt> and <tt class="literal">&lt;H2&gt;</tt>...<tt class="literal">&lt;/H2&gt;</tt> tags in HTML.  In fact, that's
exactly what those translators convert these directives into.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">=cut</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <tt class="literal">=cut</tt> directive indicates the end of a stretch of pod.  (There
might be more pod later in the document, but if so it will be
introduced with another pod directive.)</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">=pod</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <tt class="literal">=pod</tt> directive does nothing beyond telling the compiler to lay
off parsing code through the next <tt class="literal">=cut</tt>.  It's useful for adding
another paragraph to the document if you're mixing up code and pod a
lot.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">=over</tt> <em class="replaceable">NUMBER</em></b>
</dt>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">=item</tt> <em class="replaceable">SYMBOL</em></b>
</dt>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">=back</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <tt class="literal">=over</tt> directive starts a section specifically for the generation
of a list using the <tt class="literal">=item</tt> directive.  At the end of your list, use
<tt class="literal">=back</tt> to end it.  The <em class="replaceable">NUMBER</em>, if provided, hints to the
formatter how many spaces to indent.  Some formatters aren't rich
enough to respect the hint, while others are <em class="emphasis">too</em> rich to respect
it, insofar as it's difficult when working with proportional fonts to
make anything line up merely by counting spaces. (However, four spaces is generally construed as enough room for bullets
or numbers.)</p>

<p>The actual type of the list is indicated by the <em class="replaceable">SYMBOL</em> on the
individual items.  Here is a bulleted list:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">=over 4

=item *

Mithril armor

=item *

Elven cloak

=back</pre>
</blockquote>

And a numbered list:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">=over 4

=item 1.

First, speak "friend".

=item 2.

Second, enter Moria.

=back</pre>
</blockquote>

And a named list:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">=over 4

=item armor()

Description of the armor() function

=item chant()

Description of the chant() function

=back</pre>
</blockquote>

You may nest lists of the same or different types, but some
basic rules apply: don't use <tt class="literal">=item</tt> outside an <tt class="literal">=over</tt>/<tt class="literal">=back</tt> block; use
at least one <tt class="literal">=item</tt> inside an <tt class="literal">=over</tt>/<tt class="literal">=back</tt> block; and perhaps
most importantly, keep the type of the items consistent within a given
list.  Either use <tt class="literal">=item *</tt> for each item to produce a bulleted list,
or <tt class="literal">=item 1.</tt>, <tt class="literal">=item 2.</tt>, and so on to produce numbered list, or use
<tt class="literal">=item foo</tt>, <tt class="literal">=item bar</tt>, and so on to produce a named list.  If you
start with bullets or numbers, stick with them, since formatters are
allowed to use the first <tt class="literal">=item</tt> type to decide how to format the
list.<p></p>

<p>As with everything in pod, the result is only as good as the
translator.  Some translators pay attention to the particular
numbers (or letters, or Roman numerals) following the <tt class="literal">=item</tt>, and
others don't.  The current <em class="emphasis">pod2html</em> translator, for instance,
is quite cavalier: it strips out the sequence indicators entirely
without looking at them to infer what sequence you're using, then
wraps the entire list inside <tt class="literal">&lt;OL&gt;</tt> and <tt class="literal">&lt;/OL&gt;</tt> tags so
that the browser can display it as an ordered list in HTML.  This
is not to be construed a feature; it may eventually be fixed.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">=for</tt> <em class="replaceable">TRANSLATOR</em></b>
</dt>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">=begin</tt> <em class="replaceable">TRANSLATOR</em></b>
</dt>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">=end</tt> <em class="replaceable">TRANSLATOR</em></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<tt class="literal">=for</tt>, <tt class="literal">=begin</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">=end</tt> let you include special sections to be passed
through unaltered, but only to particular formatters. Formatters that
recognize their own names, or aliases for their names, in
<em class="replaceable">TRANSLATOR</em> pay attention to that directive;
any others completely ignore them.  The directive
<tt class="literal">=for</tt> specifies that just the rest of this
paragraph is destined <em class="emphasis">for</em> a particular
translator.
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">=for html
&lt;p&gt; This is a &lt;flash&gt;raw&lt;/flash&gt; &lt;small&gt;HTML&lt;/small&gt; paragraph &lt;/p&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

The paired <tt class="literal">=begin</tt> and <tt class="literal">=end</tt>
directives work similarly to <tt class="literal">=for</tt>, but instead of
accepting a single paragraph only, they treat all text between matched
<tt class="literal">=begin</tt> and <tt class="literal">=end</tt> as destined for
a particular translator.  Some examples:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">=begin html

&lt;br&gt;Figure 1.&lt;IMG SRC="figure1.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=end html

=begin text

  ---------------
  |  foo        |
  |        bar  |
  ---------------

^^^^ Figure 1. ^^^^

=end text</pre>
</blockquote>

Values of <em class="replaceable">TRANSLATOR</em> commonly accepted by
formatters include <tt class="literal">roff</tt>, <tt class="literal">man</tt>,
<tt class="literal">troff</tt>, <tt class="literal">nroff</tt>,
<tt class="literal">tbl</tt>, <tt class="literal">eqn</tt>,
<tt class="literal">latex</tt>, <tt class="literal">tex</tt>,
<tt class="literal">html</tt>, and <tt class="literal">text</tt>.  Some formatters
will accept some of these as synonyms.  No translator accepts
<tt class="literal">comment</tt>--that's just the customary word for
something to be ignored by everybody. Any unrecognized word would
serve the same purpose. While writing this book, we often left notes
for ourselves under the directive <tt class="literal">=for later</tt>.<p></p>

<p>Note that <tt class="literal">=begin</tt> and <tt class="literal">=end</tt> do
nest, but only in the sense that the outermost matched set causes
everything in the middle to be treated as nonpod, even if it happens
to contain other <em class="replaceable">=word</em> directives.  That
is, as soon as any translator sees <tt class="literal">=begin foo</tt>, it
will either ignore or process <em class="emphasis">everything</em> down to
the corresponding <tt class="literal">=end foo</tt>.</p>
</dd>

</dl>






<h3 class="sect2">26.1.3. Pod Sequences</h3>

<p>The third type of paragraph is simply "flowed" text.  That is, if a
paragraph doesn't start with either whitespace or an equals sign, it's
taken as a plain paragraph: regular text that's typed in with as few
frills as possible.  Newlines are treated as equivalent to spaces.
It's largely up to the translator to make it look nice, because
programmers have more important things to do.  It is assumed that
translators will apply certain common heuristics--see the section "Pod Translators
and Modules" later in this chapter.</p>

<p>You can do some things explicitly, however.  Inside either
ordinary paragraphs or heading/item directives (but not in verbatim
paragraphs), you may use special sequences to adjust the formatting.
These sequences always start with a single capital letter followed by a
left angle bracket, and extend through the matching (not necessarily
the next) right angle bracket.  Sequences may contain other sequences.</p>

<p>Here are the sequences defined by pod:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">I&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">text</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Italicized text, used for emphasis, book titles, names of
ships, and manpage references such as "<em class="emphasis">perlpod</em>(1)".</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">B&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">text</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Emboldened text, used almost exclusively for command-line switches
and sometimes for names of programs.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">C&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">text</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Literal code, probably in a fixed-width font like Courier.  Not
needed on simple items that the translator should be able to infer
as code, but you should put it anyway.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">S&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">text</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Text with nonbreaking spaces.  Often surrounds other sequences.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">name</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>A cross reference (link) to a name:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">name</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Manual page</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">name/ident</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Item in manual page</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">name/"sec"</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Section in other manual page</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">"sec"</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Section in this manual page (the quotes are optional)</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">/"sec"</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ditto</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The next five sequences are the same as those above, but the output will be
only <em class="replaceable">text</em>, with the link information hidden as in
HTML:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">text</em><tt class="literal">|</tt><em class="replaceable">name</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">text</em><tt class="literal">|</tt><em class="replaceable">name</em><tt class="literal">/</tt><em class="replaceable">ident</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">text</em><tt class="literal">|</tt><em class="replaceable">name</em><tt class="literal">/</tt><em class="replaceable">"sec"</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">text</em><tt class="literal">|</tt><em class="replaceable">"sec"</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">L&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">text</em><tt class="literal">|/</tt><em class="replaceable">"sec"</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em class="replaceable">text</em> cannot contain the characters <tt class="literal">/</tt> and <tt class="literal">|</tt>, and should
contain <tt class="literal">&lt;</tt> or <tt class="literal">&gt;</tt> only in matched pairs.</p>
</dd>

</dl>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">F&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">pathname</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Used for filenames.  This is traditionally rendered the same as <tt class="literal">I</tt>.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">X&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">entry</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>An index entry of some sort.  As always, it's up to the translator to decide what to do.
The pod specification doesn't dictate that.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">E&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">escape</em><tt class="literal">&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>A named character, similar to HTML escapes:</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt class="literal">Z&lt;&gt;</tt></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>A zero-width character.  This is nice for putting in front of sequences
that might confuse something.  For example, if you had a line
in regular prose that had to start with an equals sign, you could write
that as:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">Z&lt;&gt;=can you see</pre>
</blockquote>

or for something with a "From" in it, so the mailer doesn't put a <tt class="literal">&gt;</tt> in front:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">Z&lt;&gt;From here on out...</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Most of the time, you'll need only a single set of angle brackets to
delimit one of these pod sequences.  Sometimes, however, you will want
to put a <tt class="literal">&lt;</tt> or <tt class="literal">&gt;</tt> inside a
sequence.  (This is particularly common when using a
<tt class="literal">C&lt;&gt;</tt> sequence to provide a constant-width font
for a snippet of code.)  As with all things in Perl, there is more
than one way to do it.  One way is to simply represent the closing
bracket with an <tt class="literal">E</tt> sequence:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

This produces "<tt class="literal">$a &lt;=&gt; $b</tt>".<p></p>

<p>A more readable, and perhaps more "plain" way, is to use an alternate
set of delimiters that doesn't require the angle brackets to be escaped.
Doubled angle brackets (<tt class="literal">C&lt;&lt;</tt><em class="replaceable">stuff</em><tt class="literal">&gt;&gt;</tt>) may be used,
provided there is whitespace immediately following the opening
delimiter and immediately preceding the closing one.  For
example, the following will work:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">C&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

You may use as many repeated angle-brackets as you like so
long as you have the same number of them on both sides, and you make
sure that whitespace immediately follows the last <tt class="literal">&lt;</tt> of the left side
and immediately precedes the first <tt class="literal">&gt;</tt> of the right side.  So the
following will also work:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">C&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;
C&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

All these end up spitting out <tt class="literal">$a &lt;=&gt; $b</tt> in a constant-width font.<p></p>

<p>The extra whitespace inside on either end goes away, so you should
leave 

whitespace on the outside if you want it.  Also, the two inside
chunks of extra whitespace don't overlap, so if the first thing being
quoted is <tt class="literal">&gt;&gt;</tt>, it isn't taken as the closing delimiter:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">The C&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; right shift operator.</pre>
</blockquote>

This produces "The <tt class="literal">&gt;&gt;</tt> right shift operator."<p></p>

<p>Note that pod sequences <em class="emphasis">do</em> nest.  That means you can
write "<tt class="literal">The I&lt;Santa MarE&lt;iacute&gt;a&gt; left port
already</tt>" to produce "The <em class="emphasis">Santa Mar&#237;a</em>
left port already", or "<tt class="literal">B&lt;touch&gt; S&lt;B&lt;-t&gt;
I&lt;time&gt;&gt; I&lt;file&gt;</tt>" to produce
"<b class="emphasis-bold">touch -t&nbsp;</b><em class="emphasis">time</em><em class="emphasis">file</em>", and expect this to work properly.</p>
