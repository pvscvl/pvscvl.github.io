<h2 class="sect1">1.1. Getting Started</h2>

<p>We think that Perl is an easy language to learn and use, and we hope to
convince you that we're right.  One thing that's easy about Perl is that
you don't have to say much before you say what you want to say.  In many
programming languages, you have to declare the types, variables, and
subroutines you are going to use before you can write the first
statement of executable code.  And for complex problems demanding
complex data structures, declarations are a good idea.  But for many simple,
everyday problems, you'd like a programming language in which you
can simply say:
<blockquote>
<pre class="programlisting">print "Howdy, world!\n";</pre>
</blockquote>

and expect the program to do just that.
<a name="INDEX-17"></a>
</p>

<p>Perl is such a language.  In fact, this example is a complete
program,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> and if you feed it to the Perl
interpreter, it will print "<tt class="literal">Howdy, world!</tt>" on your screen.
(The <tt class="literal">\n</tt> in the example produces a newline at the end of the output.)
<a name="INDEX-18"></a>
</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-1"></a>
<p>[1] Or script, or application, or executable, or
doohickey.  Whatever.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And that's that.  You don't have to say much <em class="emphasis">after</em> you say what you
want to say, either. Unlike many languages, Perl thinks that falling off
the end of your program is just a normal way to exit the program.  You
certainly <em class="emphasis">may</em> call the <tt class="literal">exit</tt> function explicitly if you wish, just
as you <em class="emphasis">may</em> declare some of your variables, or even
<em class="emphasis">force</em> yourself to declare all your variables.  But
it's your choice.  With Perl you're free to do The Right Thing, however
you care to define it.
<a name="INDEX-19"></a><a name="INDEX-20"></a>
</p>

<p>There are many other reasons why Perl is easy to use, but it would be
pointless to list them all here, because that's what the rest of the
book is for.  The devil may be in the details, as they say, but Perl
tries to help you out down there in the hot place too.  At every level,
Perl is about helping you get from here to there with minimum fuss and
maximum enjoyment.  That's why so many Perl programmers go around with a
silly grin on their face.</p>

<p>This chapter is an overview of Perl, so we're not trying to present
Perl to the rational side of your brain.  Nor are we trying to be
complete, or logical.  That's what the following chapters are
for.  Vulcans, androids, and like-minded humans should skip
this overview and go straight to <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "Bits and Pieces"</a>, for maximum
information density.  If, on the other hand, you're looking for a
carefully paced tutorial, you should probably get Randal's nice book,
<em class="citetitle">Learning Perl</em> (published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates).  But don't throw
 this book out just yet.</p>

<p>This chapter presents Perl to the <em class="emphasis">other</em> side of your brain, whether
you prefer to call it associative, artistic, passionate, or merely
spongy.  To that end, we'll be presenting various views of Perl that
will give you as clear a picture of Perl as the blind men had of the
elephant.  Well, okay, maybe we can do better than that.  We're dealing
with a camel here (see the cover).  Hopefully, at least one of these views
of Perl will help get you over the hump.</p>
