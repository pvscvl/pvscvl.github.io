<h2 class="sect1">9.3. Structure of Internet Email</h2>


<p>Email <a name="INDEX-1852" /> <a name="INDEX-1,853" /> <a name="INDEX-1,854" /> <a name="INDEX-1,855" />messages are documents containing
<a name="INDEX-1856" />headers and a
<a name="INDEX-1857" />body separated by a blank line. Each
header contains a field name followed by a colon, some space, and a
value. Does this sound familiar? In a basic sense, Internet mail
messages are similar in structure to <a name="INDEX-1858" />HTTP messages. There are
also a number of differences of course: there is no request line or
status line; email messages are text documents (binary attachments
must be encoded as text before being sent); and most of the field
names are different. But if you recall the basic header and body
format from our earlier HTTP discussion, that will help you
understand how to create email messages.</p>


<p>Some
<a name="INDEX-1859" />
<a name="INDEX-1860" />header fields hold email
addresses. These can support the full syntax of email addresses that
we saw earlier, including the recipient's name in addition to
the email address itself, like so:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Mary Smith &lt;mary@somewhere.com&gt;</pre></blockquote>


<p>The shorter <em class="emphasis">mary@somewhere.com</em> is also acceptable.</p>


<p>There are only a few header fields you need to include in email
messages: who it is to, who it is from, and what it is about. The
first of these fields is actually any of three fields:
<em class="emphasis">To</em>
<a name="INDEX-1861" /> <a name="INDEX-1,862" />,
<em class="emphasis">Cc</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Bcc</em>.
<em class="emphasis">To</em> and <em class="emphasis">Cc</em> (which stands for
<em class="emphasis">carbon-copy</em>) contain the email addresses of any
of the recipients of the message. The
<em class="emphasis">Bcc</em>
<a name="INDEX-1863" /> field (which stands for
<em class="emphasis">blind carbon-copy</em>) does likewise but is deleted
from the message before it is sent. The
<em class="emphasis">From</em>
<a name="INDEX-1864" /> <a name="INDEX-1,865" /> field contains the email address
of the person the message is from. If you want replies to be directed
elsewhere, you may also specify that email address in the
<em class="emphasis">Reply-To</em>
<a name="INDEX-1866" /> field. Finally, the
<em class="emphasis">Subject</em>
<a name="INDEX-1867" /> field contains a summary of the email
address.</p>


<p>So far, this is all pretty basic; all of us have received email
before. There is, however, a subtle distinction that is important to
note. Internet email is in some ways similar to real paper mail: it
has a message, which can contain anything, inside an envelope, and
the envelope carries the <a name="INDEX-1868" />routing information. On formal letters,
you often add the recipient's address information to the top of
the message; however, it's quite possible to put a message
addressed this way in an envelope that is actually addressed and
routed to someone else. The same thing is possible with Internet
email. The <em class="emphasis">To</em>, <em class="emphasis">Cc</em>,
<em class="emphasis">Bcc</em>, and <em class="emphasis">From</em> fields are
actually part of the message. They do not determine any of the
routing information and do not need to match who the message truly is
to or from. You have probably received <em class="firstterm">spam</em>
that, according to the <em class="emphasis">To</em> field, appeared to be
addressed to someone other than you; likewise, the recipient listed
in the <em class="emphasis">From</em> field on most spam is not the true
sender. However, for our purposes, we typically do want the address
information and these fields to line up. We'll explore this
more when we review each of the mailers below.</p>


<p>There are many other important fields that appear in the headers of
email addresses, but mailers take care of adding these for you, so we
won't include them in our discussion.</p>
