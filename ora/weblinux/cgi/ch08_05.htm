<h2 class="sect1">8.5. Data Storage</h2>


<p>There <a name="INDEX-1781" /> <a name="INDEX-1,782" />are a number of security issues
specifically related to reading and writing data. We'll discuss
data storage in much greater detail in <a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "Data Persistence"</a>.
Let's review the security issues now.</p>


<a name="ch08-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.5.1. Dynamic Filenames</h3>


<p>You <a name="INDEX-1783" />
<a name="INDEX-1784" />
<a name="INDEX-1785" />should be extra careful when opening
files where the
<a name="INDEX-1786" /> <a name="INDEX-1,787" />filename is dynamically generated
based upon user input. For example, you may have data arranged
according to date, with a separate directory for each year and a
separate file for each month. If you have a CGI script that allows
the user to search for records in this file according to month and
year, you would <em class="emphasis">not</em> want to use this code:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/usr/bin/perl -wT

use strict;
use CGI;
use CGIBook::Error;

my $q = new CGI;
my @missing;

my $month = $q-&gt;param( "month" ) or push @missing, "month";
my $year  = $q-&gt;param( "year"  ) or push @missing, "year";
my $key   = quotemeta( $q-&gt;param( "key" ) ) or push @missing, "key";

if ( @missing ) {
    my $fields = join ", ", @missing;
    error( $q, "You left the following required fields blank: $fields."  );
}

local *FILE;

## This is INSECURE unless you first check the validity of $year and $month
open FILE, "/usr/local/apache/data/$year/$month" or
    error( $q, "Invalid month or year" );

print $q-&gt;header( "text/html" ),
      $q-&gt;start_html( "Results" ),
      $q-&gt;h1( "Results" ),
      $q-&gt;start_pre;

while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {
    print if /$key/;
}

print $q-&gt;end_pre,
      $q-&gt;end_html;</pre></blockquote>


<p>Any user who supplied "../../../../../etc/passwd" as a
month could browse <em class="filename">/etc/passwd </em> -- probably
not a feature you want to provide. Assuming that your web form passes
two-digit numbers for months and days, you should add the following
lines:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">unless ( $year =~ /^\d\d$/ and $month =~ /^\d\d$/ ) {
    error( $q, "Invalid month or year" );
}</pre></blockquote>


<p>You may have noticed that taint mode is enabled and wondered why it
did not catch this security problem. Remember, the function of taint
mode is to not allow you to accidentally use data that comes from
outside your program to change resources outside your program. This
code does not attempt to change any outside resources, so taint mode
sees no reason to stop the script from reading
<em class="filename">/etc/passwd</em>. Taint mode will only stop you from
opening a file with an user-supplied filename if you are opening the
file to write to it.</p>


<p>In this example, we were reading from a text file, but this security
issue applies to other forms of data storage too. We could have just
as easily been reading from a DBM file instead. Likewise when you use
a RDBMS, you must specify what database you wish to connect to, and
it is very poor design to allow the user to specify what database to
open and read.</p>

<a name="ch08-14-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.5.2. Location of Files</h3>


<p>Your <a name="INDEX-1788" />
<a name="INDEX-1789" />data files should not be directly
browsable by the user, so they should not be in the web
<a name="INDEX-1790" />server's
document tree. This is a mistake people frequently make when
installing third party web applications. Many freely available web
applications are distributed with all of their files -- including
configuration files that contain important data like administrative
passwords -- in one directory to make them easy to install. If you
install the application as it comes packaged, then anyone who is
familiar with the application can access the configuration
information and possibly exploit it. Often these applications allow
you to change filenames relatively easily, so some developers try to
hide important data files by renaming them from their default name to
a more obscure name. A much better solution is to move them out of
the web document tree altogether.</p>


<p>Unless you store all of your data in an RDBMS, you should have a
standard data tree just like your web document tree where you can
store all your application data. Give each web application a
subdirectory under the root data directory. Do
<em class="emphasis">not</em> configure the web server to serve files out
of this directory. In our examples, we use
<em class="filename">/usr/local/apache/data</em> as the root of our data
tree.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch08-15-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.5.3. File Permissions</h3>


<p>You should use your
<a name="INDEX-1791" />
<a name="INDEX-1792" />
<a name="INDEX-1793" />
<a name="INDEX-1794" />
<a name="INDEX-1795" />web
<a name="INDEX-1796" />server's
filesystem to help you control read and write access to data files.
On Unix systems, each directory and file has an owner, a group, and a
set of permissions. The web server also runs as a particular user and
group, such as <em class="emphasis">nobody</em>.</p>


<p>The web server should not have write access to any file it
doesn't need to write to. This simple guideline may sound
obvious, but it is often ignored in practice.</p>


<p>Data files that your scripts only need to read should be owned by
<em class="emphasis">nobody</em>
<a name="INDEX-1797" />, and they should have a restrictive file
permission like <tt class="literal">0644</tt>. If the web server needs to
be able to write to a file and it is not the creator of the file, you
may want to set the group of the file to <em class="emphasis">nobody</em>
and enable the group write bit by setting its permission to
<tt class="literal">0664</tt>.</p>


<p>If the web server needs to be able to create files or subdirectories
within a directory, then that directory must be writable. Assign its
group to <em class="emphasis">nobody</em> and change the permissions to
<tt class="literal">0775</tt>; otherwise, directories should be
<tt class="literal">0755</tt>. Realize that if you make a directory
writable, then existing files can be deleted or replaced even if
these files themselves <a name="INDEX-1798" /> <a name="INDEX-1,799" />are read-only.</p>
