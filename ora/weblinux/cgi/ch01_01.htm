<p>Like the rest of the Internet, the <em class="firstterm">Common Gateway
Interface</em>
<a name="INDEX-1" /> <a name="INDEX-2" />, or <em class="firstterm">CGI</em>, has come a very
long way in a very short time. Just a handful of years ago, CGI
scripts were more of a novelty than practical; they were associated
with hit counters and guestbooks, and were written largely by
hobbyists. Today, CGI scripts, written by professional web
developers, provide the logic to power much of the vast structure the
Internet has become.</p>


















<div class="sect1"><a name="ch01-55491" />
<h2 class="sect1">1.1. History</h2>



<p>Despite the <a name="INDEX-3" /> <a name="INDEX-4" />attention
it now receives, <a name="INDEX-5" /> <a name="INDEX-6" />the Internet is not new. In fact, the
precursor to today's Internet began thirty years ago. The
Internet began its existence as the ARPAnet, which was funded by the
United States Department of Defense to study networking. The Internet
grew gradually during its first 25 years, and then suddenly
blossomed.</p>



<p>The Internet has always contained a variety of protocols for
exchanging information, but when web browsers such as NCSA Mosaic
and, later, Netscape Navigator appeared, they spurred an explosive
growth. In the last six years, the number of web hosts alone has
grown from under a thousand to more than ten million. Now, when
people hear the term Internet, most think of the Web. Other
protocols, such as those for email, FTP, chat, and news, certainly
remain popular, but they have become secondary to the Web, as more
people are using web sites as their gateway to access these other
services.</p>



<p>The Web was by no means the first technology available for publishing
and exchanging information, but there was something different about
the Web that prompted its explosive growth. We'd love to tell
you that CGI was the sole factor for the Web's early growth
over protocols like FTP and Gopher. But that wouldn't be true.
Probably the real reason the Web gained popularity initially was
because it came with pictures. The Web was designed to present
multiple forms of media: browsers supported inlined images almost
from the start, and HTML supported rudimentary layout control that
made information easier to present and read. This control continued
to increase as Netscape added support for new extensions to HTML with
each successive release of the browser.</p>



<p>Thus initially, the Web grew into a collection of personal home pages
and assorted web sites containing a variety of miscellaneous
information. However, no one really knew what to
<em class="emphasis">do</em> with it, especially businesses. In 1995, a
common refrain in corporations was "Sure the Internet is great,
but how many people have actually made money online?" How
quickly things change.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.1.1. How CGI Is Used Today</h3>



<p>Today, <a name="INDEX-7" />
<a name="INDEX-8" />e-commerce has taken off and dot-com
startups are appearing everywhere. Several technologies have been
fundamental to this progress, and CGI is certainly one of the most
important. CGI allows the Web to <em class="emphasis">do</em> things, to
be more than a collection of static resources. A
<em class="firstterm">static</em>
<a name="INDEX-9" /> <a name="INDEX-10" /> resource is something
that does not change from request to request, such as an HTML file or
a graphic. A <em class="firstterm">dynamic</em> resource is one that
contains information that may vary with each request, depending on
any number of conditions including a changing data source (like a
database), the identity of the user, or input from the user. By
supporting dynamic content, CGI allows web servers to provide online
applications that users from around the world on various platforms
can all access via a standard client: a web browser.</p>



<p>It is difficult to enumerate all that CGI can do, because it does so
much. If you perform a search on a web site, a CGI application is
probably processing your information. If you fill out a registration
form on the Web, a CGI application is probably processing your
information. If you make an online purchase, a CGI application is
probably validating your credit card and logging the transaction. If
you view a chart online that dynamically displays information
graphically, chances are that a CGI application created that chart.
Of course, over the last few years other technologies have appeared
to handle dynamic tasks like these; we'll look at some of those
in a moment. However, CGI remains the most popular way to do these
tasks and more.</p>
