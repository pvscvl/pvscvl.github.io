<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>






<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>



<p>The animal on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Programming the Perl
DBI</em> is a cheetah (<em class="emphasis">Acinonyx jubatus</em>),
one of the oldest big cats, dating back four million years.</p>



<p>The cheetah is the fastest land animal in the world, reaching
speeds up to 70 miles per hour, powered by its long legs and lean
body. Its body is tan with black spots, and, at a distance, it's hard
to tell males from females. A cheetah grows to be approximately two
and a half feet tall at the shoulder; it measures around four feet
long, with a tail about two feet long. An adult weighs 90-130
pounds. The life span of the cheetah is about ten years.</p>



<p>A mother cheetah's litter includes four to five cubs, who stay
with their mother for a year and a half. The young learn hunting and
survival skills in that time. The cheetah hunts by stalking and
chasing its prey, which includes antelope, gazelles, rabbits, and game
birds.</p>



<p>The cheetah is now considered to be an endangered species, with
only 10,000-12,000 alive today, living almost exclusively in the
grasslands of Africa. That number is much lower than the estimated
100,000 in 1900. In fact, it is extinct in more than twenty of the
countries it originally inhabited. The cheetah suffers from loss of
both habitat and food, plus poaching. Conservation groups are working
to help preserve the cheetah in its natural habitat and keep it from
extinction.</p>



<p>Nicole Arigo was the production editor and copyeditor for this
book . Madeleine Newell proofread the book. Melanie Wang, Sarah Jane
Shangraw, and Jane Ellin provided quality control. Judy Hoer wrote the
index.</p>



<p>Hanna Dyer designed the cover of this book, based on a series
design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is a 19th-century engraving
from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Kathleen Wilson produced the cover
layout with QuarkXPress 4.04 using Adobe's ITC Garamond font. Alicia
Cech designed the interior layout based on a series design by Nancy
Priest. Mike Sierra implemented the design in FrameMaker 5.5. The text
and heading fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book. The
illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano
using Macromedia FreeHand 8 and Adobe Photoshop 5. This colophon was
written by Nicole Arigo.</p>
