<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>





<p>The DBI is the standard database interface for the Perl programming
language. The DBI is database-independent, which means that it can
work with just about any database, such as Oracle, Sybase, Informix,
Access, MySQL, etc.</p>



<p>While we assume that readers of this book have some experience with
Perl, we don't assume much familiarity with databases
themselves. The book starts out slowly, describing different types of
databases and introducing the reader to common terminology.</p>



<p>This book is not solely about the DBI -- it also concerns the more
general subject of storing data in and retrieving data from databases
of various forms. As such, this book is split into two related, but
standalone, parts. The first part covers techniques for storing and
retrieving data without the DBI, and the second, much larger part,
covers the use of the DBI and related technologies.</p>



<p>Throughout the book, we assume that you have a basic grounding in
programming with Perl and can put together simple scripts without
instruction. If you don't have this level of Perl awareness, we
suggest that you read some of the Perl books listed in <a href="ch00_01.htm">Section 0.1, "Resources "</a>.</p>



<p>Once you're ready to read this book, there are some shortcuts
that you can take depending on what you're most interested in
reading about. If you are interested solely in the DBI, you can skip
<a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "Basic Non-DBI Databases  "</a> without too much of a problem. On the
other hand, if you're a wizard with SQL, then you should
probably skip <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "SQL and Relational Databases "</a> to avoid the pain of us
glossing over many fine details. <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "ODBC and the DBI "</a> is a
comparison between the DBI and ODBC and is mainly of interest to
database geeks, design aficionados, and those people who have
<tt class="literal">Win32::ODBC</tt> applications and are desperately
trying to port them to DBI.</p>



<p>Here's a rundown of the book, chapter by chapter:</p>



<dl>
<dt><b><a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "Introduction "</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This introduction sets up the general feel for the book.</p></dd>



<dt><b><a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "Basic Non-DBI Databases  "</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This chapter covers the basics of storing and retrieving data either
with <em class="emphasis">core</em> Perl functions through the use of
delimited or fixed-width flat-file databases, or
<em class="emphasis">via</em> non-DBI modules such as
<tt class="literal">AnyDBM_File</tt>, <tt class="literal">Storable</tt>,
<tt class="literal">Data::Dumper</tt> and friends. Although the DBI
isn't used in this chapter, the way the
<tt class="literal">Storable</tt> and <tt class="literal">Data::Dumper</tt>
modules are used to pack Perl data structures into strings can easily
be applied to the DBI.</p></dd>



<dt><b><a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "SQL and Relational Databases "</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This chapter is a basic overview of SQL and relational databases and
how you can write simple but powerful SQL statements to query and
manipulate your database. If you already know some SQL, you can skip
this chapter. If you don't know SQL, we advise you to read this
chapter since the later chapters assume you have a basic knowledge of
SQL and relational databases.</p></dd>



<dt><b><a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "Programming with the DBI "</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This chapter introduces the DBI to you by discussing the architecture
of the DBI and basic DBI operations such as connecting to databases
and handling errors. This chapter is essential reading and describes
the framework that the DBI provides to let you write simple,
powerful, and robust programs.</p></dd>



<dt><b><a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Interacting with the Database "</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This chapter is the meat of the DBI topic and discusses manipulating
the data within your database -- that is, retrieving data already
stored in your database, inserting new data, and deleting and
updating existing data. We discuss the various ways in which you can
perform these operations from the simple "get it working"
stage to more advanced and optimized techniques for manipulating
data.</p></dd>



<dt><b><a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Advanced DBI "</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This chapter covers more advanced topics within the sphere of the DBI
such as specifying attributes to fine-tune the operation of DBI
within your applications, working with LONG/LOB datatypes, statement
and database metadata, and finally transaction handling.</p></dd>



<dt><b><a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "ODBC and the DBI "</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This chapter discusses the differences in design between DBI and
ODBC, the other portable database API. And, of course, this chapter
highlights why DBI is easier to program with.</p></dd>



<dt><b><a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, "DBI Shell and Database Proxying "</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This chapter covers two topics that aren't exactly part of the
core DBI, <em class="emphasis">per se</em>, but are extremely useful to
know about. First, we discuss the DBI shell, a command-line tool that
allows you to connect to databases and issue arbitrary queries.
Second, we discuss the proxy architecture that the DBI can use,
which, among other things, allows you to connect scripts on one
machine to databases on another machine without needing to install
any database networking software. For example, you can connect a
script running on a Unix box to a Microsoft Access database running
on a Microsoft Windows box.</p></dd>



<dt><b><a href="appa_01.htm">Appendix A, "DBI Specification "</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This appendix contains the DBI specification, which is distributed
with <tt class="literal">DBI.pm</tt>.</p></dd>



<dt><b><a href="appb_01.htm">Appendix B, "Driver and Database Characteristics "</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This appendix contains useful extra information on each of the
commonly used DBDs and their corresponding databases.</p></dd>



<dt><b><a href="appc_01.htm">Appendix C, "ASLaN Sacred Site Charter"</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>This appendix contains the charter for the Ancient Sacred Landscape
Network, which focuses on preserving sites such as the megalithic
sites used for examples in this book.</p></dd>
