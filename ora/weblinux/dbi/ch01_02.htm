<h2 class="sect1">1.2. Perl </h2>



<p>
<a name="INDEX-10" />
<a name="INDEX-11" />Perl is a
very high-level programming language originally developed in the
1980s by Larry Wall. Perl is now being developed by a group of
individuals known as the Perl5-Porters under the watchful eye of
Larry. One of Perl's many strengths is its ability to process
arbitrary chunks of textual data, known as
<em class="emphasis">strings</em>
<a name="INDEX-12" />, in many powerful ways,
including <em class="emphasis">regular-expression</em> string
manipulation. This capability makes Perl an excellent choice for
database programming, since the majority of information stored within
databases is textual in nature. Perl takes the pain of manipulating
strings out of programming, unlike C, which is not well-suited for
that task. Perl scripts tend to be far smaller than equivalent C
programs and are generally portable to other operating systems that
run Perl with little or no modification.</p>



<p>Perl also now features the ability to dynamically load external
<em class="emphasis">modules</em>
<a name="INDEX-13" />
<a name="INDEX-14" />, which are
pieces of software that can be slotted into Perl to extend and
enhance its functionality. There are literally hundreds of these
modules available now, ranging from mathematical modules to
three-dimensional graphics-rendering modules to modules that allow
you to interact with networks and network software. The DBI is a set
of modules for Perl that allows you to interact with databases.</p>



<p>In recent years, Perl has become a standard within many companies by
just being immensely useful for many different applications, the
"Swiss army knife of programming languages." It has been
heavily used by system administrators who like its flexibility and
usefulness for almost any job they can think of. When used in
conjunction with DBI, Perl makes loading and dumping databases very
straightforward, and its excellent data-manipulation capabilities
allow developers to create and manipulate data easily.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Perl has been tacitly accepted as being the de facto
language on the World Wide Web for writing CGI programs. What's
this got to do with databases? Using Perl and DBI, you can quickly
deploy powerful <a name="INDEX-15" />CGI scripts that generate dynamic
web pages from the data contained within your databases. For example,
online shopping catalogs can be stored within a database and
presented to shoppers as a series of dynamically created web pages.
The sample code for this book revolves around a database of
archaeological sites that you can deploy on the Web.</p>



<p>Bolstered by this proof of concept, and the emergence of new and
powerful modules such as the DBI and the rapid
<a name="INDEX-16" /> <a name="INDEX-17" />GUI development toolkit Tk, major
corporations are now looking towards Perl to provide rapid
development capabilities for building fast, robust, and portable
applications to be deployed within corporate intranets and on the
Internet.</p>
