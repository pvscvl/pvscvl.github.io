<h2 class="sect1">1.3. How Does Apache Use TCP/IP?</h2>








<p>Let's look at a server from the outside. We have a box in which
there is a computer, software, and a connection to the outside
world -- a piece of Ethernet or a serial line to a modem, for
example. This connection is known as an
<em class="emphasis">interface</em>
<a name="INDEX-54" />
and is known to the world by its <a name="INDEX-55" />IP address. If the box had two
interfaces, they would each have an IP address, and these addresses
would normally be different. One interface, on the other hand, may
have more than one IP address (see <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Toward a Real Web Site"</a>).</p>








<p>Requests arrive on an interface for a number of different services
offered by the server using different
<a name="INDEX-56" />protocols:</p>








<ul><li><p>Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP): news</p></li><li><p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): mail</p></li><li><p>Domain Name Service (DNS)</p></li><li><p>HTTP: World Wide Web</p></li></ul>
<p>The server can decide how to handle these different requests because
the four-byte IP address that leads the request to its interface is
followed by a two-byte port number. Different services attach to
different ports:<a name="INDEX-57" />
<a name="INDEX-58" /></p>








<ul><li><p>NNTP: port number 119</p></li><li><p>SMTP: port number 25</p></li><li><p>DNS: port number 53</p></li><li><p>HTTP: port number 80</p></li></ul>
<p>As the local administrator or webmaster, you can (if you really want)
decide to attach any service to any port. Of course, if you decide to
step outside convention, you need to make sure that your clients
share your thinking. Our concern here is just with WWW and Apache.
Apache, by default, listens to port number 80 because it deals in WWW
business.</p>








<p><img src="figs/unix_icon.gif" alt="Figure 1.3" />   Port numbers below 1024 can only be used by the
<a name="INDEX-59" />
<a name="INDEX-60" />superuser
(<em class="emphasis">root</em>, under Unix); this prevents other users from
running programs masquerading as standard services, but brings its
own problems, as we shall see.</p>








<p><img src="figs/win32_icon.gif" alt="Figure 1.3" />   Under <a name="INDEX-61" />Win32 there is
<a name="INDEX-62" />
<a name="INDEX-63" />currently
no real security beyond what you can provide yourself (using file
permissions) and no superuser (at least, not as far as port numbers
are concerned).</p>








<p>This is fine if our machine is providing only one web server to the
world. In real life, you may want to host several, many, dozens, or
even hundreds of servers, which appear to the world to be completely
different from each other. This situation was not anticipated by the
authors of HTTP/1.0, so handling a number of hosts on one machine has
to be done by a kludge, which is to assign multiple addresses to the
same interface and distinguish the virtual host by its IP address.
This technique is known as <em class="emphasis">IP-intensive virtual
hosting</em>. Using HTTP/1.1, virtual hosts may be created by
assigning multiple names to the same IP address. The browser sends a
<tt class="literal">Host</tt> header to say which name it is using.</p>








<a name="ch01-1-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.3.1. Multiple Sites: Unix</h3>








<p>By happy accident, the crucial <a name="INDEX-64" />Unix utility
<em class="emphasis">ifconfig</em>
<a name="INDEX-65" />, which binds IP addresses to physical
interfaces, often allows the binding of multiple IP numbers so that
people can switch from one IP number to another and maintain service
during the transition.</p>








<p>In practical terms, on many versions of Unix, we run
<em class="emphasis">ifconfig</em> to give multiple IP addresses to the
same interface. The interface in this context is actually the bit of
software -- the driver -- that handles the physical connection
(Ethernet card, serial port, etc.) to the outside. While writing this
book, we accessed the practice sites through an Ethernet connection
between a Windows 95 machine (the client) and a FreeBSD box (the
server) running Apache.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-8">[8]</a></p><blockquote>







<a name="FOOTNOTE-8" /><p>[8]Our environment was very
untypical, since the whole thing sat on a desktop with no access to
the Web. The FreeBSD box was set up using
<em class="emphasis">ifconfig</em> in a script
<em class="filename">lan_setup</em>, which contained the following
lines:

<blockquote><pre class="code">ifconfig ep0 192.168.123.2
ifconfig ep0 192.168.123.3 alias netmask 0xFFFFFFFF
ifconfig ep0 192.168.124.1 alias</pre></blockquote>








The first line binds the IP address 192.168.123.2 to the
physical interface <tt class="literal">ep0</tt>. The second binds an alias
of 192.168.123.3 to the same interface. We used a subnet mask
(<tt class="literal">netmask 0xFFFFFFFF</tt>) to suppress a tedious error
message generated by the FreeBSD TCP/IP stack. This address was used
to demonstrate virtual hosts. We also bound yet another IP address,
192.168.124.1, to the same interface, simulating a remote server in
order to demonstrate Apache's proxy server. The important feature to
note here is that the address 192.168.124.1 is on a different IP
network from the address 192.168.123.2, even though it shares the same
physical network. No subnet mask was needed in this case, as the error
message it suppressed arose from the fact that 192.168.123.2 and
192.168.123.3 are on the same network.</p>








<a name="FOOTNOTE-8" /><p>Unfortunately, each Unix implementation tends to do this
slightly differently, so these commands may not work on your
system. Check your manuals!</p>







</blockquote>








<p>
<a name="INDEX-66" />
<a name="INDEX-67" />In
real life, we do not have much to do with IP addresses. Web sites
(and Internet hosts generally) are known by their names, such as
<em class="emphasis">www.butterthlies.com</em> or
<em class="emphasis">sales.butterthlies.com</em>, which we
shall meet later. On the authors' system, these names both
translate into 192.168.123.2.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.3.2. Multiple Sites: Win32</h3>








<p>
<a name="INDEX-68" />As far as we can discern, it is not
possible to assign multiple IP addresses to a single interface under
a standard Windows 95 system. On Windows NT it can be done via
Control Panel <img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic> Networks <img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic> Protocols <img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic>
TCP/IP/Properties... <img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic> IP Address <img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic> Advanced. This means,
of course, that IP-intensive virtual hosting is not possible on
Windows 95.</p>
