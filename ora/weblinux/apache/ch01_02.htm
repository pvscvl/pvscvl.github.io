<h2 class="sect1">1.2. What to Know About TCP/IP</h2>








<p>
<a name="INDEX-43" />To
understand the substance of this book, you need a modest knowledge of
what TCP/IP is and what it does. You'll find more than enough
information in Craig Hunt and Robert Bruce Thompson's books on
TCP/IP,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a> but
what follows is, we think, what is necessary to know for our
book's purposes.</p><blockquote>







<a name="FOOTNOTE-5" /><p>[5]<em class="emphasis">Windows NT TCP/IP Network
Administration</em>, by Craig Hunt and Robert Bruce Thompson
(O'Reilly &amp; Associates), and <em class="emphasis">TCP/IP Network
Administration</em>,<em class="citetitle"> Second Edition</em>, by
Craig Hunt (O'Reilly &amp; Associates).</p>







</blockquote>








<p>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of
protocols enabling computers to talk to each other over networks. The
two protocols that give the suite its name are among the most
important, but there are many others, and we shall meet some of them
later. These protocols are embodied in programs on your computer
written by someone or other; it doesn't much matter who. TCP/IP
seems unusual among computer standards in that the programs that
implement it actually work, and their authors have not tried too much
to improve on the original conceptions.</p>








<p>TCP/IP only applies where there is a network. Each computer on a
network that wants to use TCP/IP has an <em class="emphasis">IP
address</em>
<a name="INDEX-44" />, for example, 192.168.123.1.</p>








<p>There are four parts in the address, separated by periods. Each part
corresponds to a byte, so the whole address is four bytes long. You
will, in consequence, seldom see any of the parts outside the range
-255.</p>








<p>Although not required by protocol, by convention there is a dividing
line somewhere inside this number: to the left is the network number
and to the right, the
<a name="INDEX-45" />
<a name="INDEX-46" />host
number. <a name="INDEX-47" />
<a name="INDEX-48" />Two
machines on the same physical network -- usually a local area
network (LAN) -- normally have the same network number and
communicate directly using TCP/IP.</p>








<p>How do we know where the dividing line is between network number and
host number? The default dividing line is determined by the first of
the four numbers: if the value of the first number is:</p>








<ul><li><p>0-127 (first byte is 0xxxxxxx binary), the dividing line is after the
first number, and it is a <a name="INDEX-49" />
<a name="INDEX-50" />Class A network. There are few class A
networks -- 125 usable ones -- but each one supports up to
16,777,214 hosts.</p></li><li><p>128-191 (first byte is 10xxxxxx binary), the dividing line is after
the second number, and it is a Class B network. There are more class
B networks -- 16,382 -- and each one can support up to 65,534
hosts.</p></li><li><p>192-223 (first byte is 110xxxxx binary), the dividing line is after
the third number, and it is a Class C network. There is a huge number
of class C networks -- 2,097,150 -- but each one supports a
paltry 254 hosts.</p></li></ul>
<p>The remaining values of the first number, 224-255, are not relevant
here. Network numbers -- the left-hand part -- that are all
0s<a href="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a> or all 1s<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a> in
binary are reserved and therefore not relevant to us either. These
addresses are as follows:</p><blockquote>







<a name="FOOTNOTE-6" /><p>[6]An all-0 network address means "this
network." This is defined in STD 5 (RFC 791).</p>







</blockquote><blockquote>







<a name="FOOTNOTE-7" /><p>[7]An all-1 network address means
"broadcast." This is also defined in STD 5 (RFC 922). In
practice, broadcast network addresses are not very useful, and,
indeed, some of these "reserved" addresses have already
been used for other purposes; for example, 127.0.0.1 means
"this machine," by convention.</p>







</blockquote>








<ul><li><p>0.x.x.x</p></li><li><p>127.x.x.x</p></li><li><p>128.0.x.x</p></li><li><p>191.255.x.x</p></li><li><p>192.0.0.x</p></li><li><p>223.255.255.x</p></li></ul>
<p>It is often possible to bypass the rules of Class A, B, and C
networks using <em class="emphasis">subnet
masks</em>
<a name="INDEX-51" />. These allow us to further subdivide the
network by using more of the bits for the network number and less for
the host number. Their correct use is rather technical, so we leave
it to the experts.</p>








<p>You do not need to know this information in order to run a host,
because the numbers you deal with are assigned to you by your network
administrator or are just facts of the Internet. But we feel you
should have some understanding in order to avoid silly conversations
with people who do know about TCP/IP. It is also relevant to
<a name="INDEX-52" />virtual
hosting because each virtual host (see <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Toward a Real Web Site"</a>)
must have its own IP address (at least until HTTP/1.1 is in wide
use).</p>








<p>Now we can think about how two machines with IP addresses X and Y
talk to each other. If X and Y are on the same network, and are
correctly configured so that they have the same network number and
different host numbers, they should be able to fire up TCP/IP and
send packets to each other down their local, physical network without
any further ado.</p>








<p>If the network numbers are not the same, TCP/IP sends the packets to
a
<em class="emphasis">router</em>
<a name="INDEX-53" />,
a special machine able, by processes that do not concern us here, to
find out where the other machine is and deliver the packets to it.
This communication may be over the Internet or might occur on your
wide area network (WAN).</p>








<p>There are two ways computers use TCP/IP to communicate:</p>








<dl>
<dt><b><em class="emphasis">UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</em></b></dt>
<dd><p>A way to send a single packet from one machine to another. It does
not guarantee delivery, and there is no acknowledgment of receipt. It
is nasty for our purposes, and we don't use it.</p></dd>








<dt><b><em class="emphasis">TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</em></b></dt>
<dd><p>A way to establish communications between two computers. It reliably
delivers messages of any size. This is a better protocol for our
purposes.</p></dd>
