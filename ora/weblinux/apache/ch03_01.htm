<h2 class="sect1">3.1. More and Better Web Sites: site.simple</h2>





<p>We are now in a position to start creating real(ish) web sites, which
can be found on the accompanying CD-ROM. For the sake of a little
extra realism, we will base them loosely round a simple web business,
Butterthlies, Inc., that creates and sells picture postcards. We need
to give it some web addresses, but since we don't yet want to
venture into the outside world, they should be variants on your own
network ID so that all the machines in the network realize that they
don't have to go out on the Web to make contact. For instance,
we edited the <em class="filename">\windows\hosts </em>file on the Win95
machine running the browser and the <em class="filename">/etc/hosts</em>
file on the Unix machine running the server to read as follows:</p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">127.0.0.1 localhost
192.168.123.2 www.butterthlies.com
192.168.123.2 sales.butterthlies.com
192.168.123.3 sales-IP.butterthlies.com
192.168.124.1 www.faraway.com</pre></blockquote>





<p><em class="emphasis">localhost</em> is obligatory, so we left it in, but
you should not make any server requests to it since the results are
likely to be confusing.</p>





<p>You probably need to consult your network manager to make similar
arrangements.</p>





<p><em class="filename">site.simple </em>is <em class="filename">site.toddle
</em>with a few small changes. The script
<em class="emphasis">go</em> is different in that it refers to
<em class="filename">... /site.simple/conf/httpd.conf</em> rather than
<em class="filename">... /site.toddle/conf/httpd.conf</em>.</p>





<p>Unix:</p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">% <b class="emphasis-bold">httpd -d /usr/www/site.simple</b></pre></blockquote>





<p>Win32:</p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">&gt;<b class="emphasis-bold">apache -d c:/usr/www/site.simple</b></pre></blockquote>





<p>This will be true of each site in the demonstration setup, so we will
not mention it again.</p>





<p>From here on there will be minimal differences between the server
setups necessary for Win32 and those for Unix. Unless one or the
other is specifically mentioned, you should assume that the text
refers to both.</p>





<p>It would be nice to have a log of what goes on. In the first edition
of this book we found that a file <em class="emphasis">access_log</em> was
created automatically in <em class="emphasis">...site.simple/logs</em>. In
a rather bizarre move since then, the Apache Group has broken
backward compatibility and now requires you to mention the log file
explicitly in the Config file using the
<tt class="literal">TransferLog</tt> directive.</p>





<p>The<em class="filename"> ... /conf/httpd.conf</em> file now contains the
following:</p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">User webuser
Group webgroup
ServerName localhost
DocumentRoot /usr/www/site.simple/htdocs
TransferLog logs/access_log</pre></blockquote>





<p>In <em class="filename">... /htdocs</em> we have, as before,
<em class="filename">1.txt </em>:</p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">hullo world from site.simple!</pre></blockquote>





<p>Now, type <tt class="literal">go</tt> on the server. Switch to the client
machine and retrieve
<em class="emphasis">http://www.butterthlies.com</em>. You should see:</p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">Index of /
. Parent Directory
. 1.txt</pre></blockquote>





<p>Click on <tt class="literal">1.txt</tt> for an inspirational message as
before.</p>





<p>This all seems satisfactory, but there is a hidden mystery. We get
the same result if we connect to
<em class="emphasis">http://sales.butterthlies.com</em>. Why is this? Why,
since we have not mentioned either of these URLs or their IP
addresses in the configuration file on
<em class="filename">site.simple</em>, do we get any response at all?</p>





<p>The answer is that when we configured the machine the server runs on,
we told the network interface to respond to any
of these IP addresses:</p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">192.168.123.2
192.168.123.3</pre></blockquote>





<p>By default Apache listens to all IP addresses belonging to the
machine and responds in the same way to all of them. If there are
<a name="INDEX-227" />virtual hosts
configured (which there aren't, in this case), Apache runs
through them, looking for an IP name that corresponds to the incoming
connection. Apache uses that configuration if it is found, or the
main configuration if it is not. Later in this chapter, we look at
more definite control with the directives
<tt class="literal">BindAddress</tt>,<tt class="literal"> Listen</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</tt>.</p>





<p>It has to be said that working like this (that is, switching rapidly
between different configurations) seemed to get
<a name="INDEX-228" />Netscape or
Internet Explorer into a rare muddle. To be sure that the server was
functioning properly while using Netscape as a browser, it was
usually necessary to reload the file under examination by holding
down the Control key while clicking on Reload. In extreme cases, it
was necessary to disable caching by going to Edit <img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic> Preferences
<img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic> Advanced <img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic> Cache. Set memory and disk cache to
and set cache comparison to Every Time. In Internet Explorer, set
Cache Compares to Every Time. If you don't, the browser tends
to display a jumble of several different responses from the server.
This occurs because we are doing what no user or administrator would
normally do, namely, flipping around between different versions of
the same site with different versions of the same file. Whenever we
flip from a newer version to an older version, Netscape is led to
believe that its cached version is up-to-date.</p>





<p>Back on the server, stop Apache with <tt class="literal">^C</tt> (or
whatever your kill character is) and look at the log files. In
<em class="filename">... /logs/access_log</em>, you should see something
like this:</p>





<blockquote><pre class="code">192.168.123.1 - - [&lt;date-time&gt;] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 177</pre></blockquote>





<p><tt class="literal">200</tt> is the response code (meaning "OK, cool,
fine"), and <tt class="literal">177</tt> is the number of bytes
transferred. In <em class="filename">... /logs/error_log</em>, there
should be nothing because nothing went wrong. However, it is a good
habit to look there from time to time, though you have to make sure
that the date and time logged correspond to the problem you are
investigating. It is easy to fool yourself with some long-gone drama.</p>





<p>Life being what it is, things can go wrong, and the client can ask
for something the server can't provide. It makes sense to allow
for this with the <tt class="literal">ErrorDocument</tt> command.</p>





<a name="ch03-1-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.1.1. ErrorDocument </h3>





<blockquote><pre class="code"><a name="INDEX-229" />ErrorDocument <em class="replaceable">error-code document</em>
Server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess</pre></blockquote>





<p>In the event of a problem or error, Apache can be configured to do
one of four things:</p>





<ol><li><p>Output a simple hardcoded error message.</p></li><li><p>Output a customized message.</p></li><li><p>Redirect to a local URL to handle the problem/error.</p></li><li><p>Redirect to an external URL to handle the problem/error.</p></li></ol>
<p>The first option is the default, whereas options 2 through 4 are
configured using the <tt class="literal">ErrorDocument</tt> directive,
which is followed by the HTTP response code and a message or URL.
Messages in this context begin with a double quotation mark
(<tt class="literal">"</tt>), which does not form part of the message
itself. Apache will sometimes offer additional information regarding
the problem or error.</p>





<p>
<a name="INDEX-230" />URLs can be local URLs beginning with a
slash ("/") or full URLs that the client can resolve. For
example:</p>






<blockquote><pre class="code">ErrorDocument 500 http://foo.example.com/cgi-bin/tester
ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/bad_urls.pl
ErrorDocument 401 /subscription_info.html
ErrorDocument 403 "Sorry can't allow you access today</pre></blockquote>





<p>Note that when you specify an <tt class="literal">ErrorDocument</tt> that
points to a remote URL (i.e., anything with a method such as
"http" in front of it), Apache will send a redirect to
the client to tell it where to find the document, even if the
document ends up being on the same server. This has several
implications, the most important being that if you use an
<tt class="literal">ErrorDocument</tt> <tt class="literal">401</tt> directive, it
must refer to a local document. This results from the nature of the
HTTP basic authentication scheme.</p>
