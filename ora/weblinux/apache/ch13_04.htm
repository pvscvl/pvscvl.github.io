<h2 class="sect1">13.4. Firewalls</h2>





<p>
<a name="INDEX-1119" />
<a name="INDEX-1120" />It
is well known that the Web is populated by mean and unscrupulous
people who want to mess up your site. Many conservative citizens
think that a firewall is the way to stop them. The purpose of a
firewall is to prevent the Internet from connecting to arbitrary
machines or services on your own LAN/WAN. Another purpose, depending
on your environment, may be to stop users on your LAN from roaming
freely around the Internet.</p>





<p>The term <em class="emphasis">firewall</em> does not mean anything
standard. There are lots of ways to achieve the objectives just
stated. Two extremes are presented in this section, and there are
lots of possibilities in between. This is a big subject: here we are
only trying to alert the webmaster to the problems that exist and to
sketch some of the ways to solve them. For more information on this
subject, see <em class="emphasis">Building Internet Firewalls</em>, by D.
Brent Chapman and Elizabeth D. Zwicky (O'Reilly &amp;
Associates).</p>





<a name="ch13-18748" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.4.1. Packet Filtering</h3>





<p>
<a name="INDEX-1121" />
<a name="INDEX-1122" />This technique is the simplest
firewall. In essence, you restrict packets that come in from the
Internet to safe ports. Packet-filter firewalls are usually
implemented using the filtering built into your Internet router. This
means that no access is given to ports below 1024 except for certain
specified ones connecting to safe services, such as SMTP, NNTP, DNS,
FTP, and HTTP. The benefit is that access is denied to potentially
dangerous services, such as the following:</p>





<dl>
<dt><b><em class="filename">finger</em>
<a name="INDEX-1123" /></b></dt>
<dd><p>Gives a list of logged-in users, and in the process tells the Bad
Guys half of what they need to log in themselves.</p></dd>





<dt><b><em class="filename">exec</em>
<a name="INDEX-1124" /></b></dt>
<dd><p>Allows the Bad Guy to run programs remotely.</p></dd>





<dt><b><em class="filename">TFTP</em>
<a name="INDEX-1125" /></b></dt>
<dd><p>An almost completely security-free file-transfer protocol.</p></dd>

</dl>





<p>The possibilities are horrendous!</p>





<p>The advantages of packet filtering are that it's quick and
easy. But there are at least two disadvantages:</p>





<ul><li><p>Even the standard services can have bugs allowing access. Once a
single machine is breached, the whole of your network is wide open.
The horribly complex program <em class="filename">sendmail</em> is a fine
example of a service that has, over the years, aided many a cracker.</p></li><li><p>Someone on the inside, cooperating with someone on the outside, can
easily breach the firewall.</p></li></ul>

<a name="ch13-3-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">13.4.2. Separate Networks </h3>





<p>
<a name="INDEX-1126" /> <a name="INDEX-1127" />A more extreme firewall implementation
involves using separate networks. In essence, you have two packet
filters and three separate, physical, networks:
<em class="emphasis">Inside</em>, <em class="emphasis">Inbetween</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">Outside</em> (see <a href="ch13_04.htm">Figure 13-1</a>).
There is a packet-filter firewall between
<em class="emphasis">Inside</em><em class="filename"> </em>and
<em class="emphasis">Inbetween</em>, and between
<em class="emphasis">Outside</em> and the Internet. A <a name="INDEX-1128" /> <a name="INDEX-1129" /> <a name="INDEX-1130" />nonrouting host,<a href="#FOOTNOTE-61">[61]</a> known as a
<em class="emphasis">bastion</em> <em class="emphasis">host</em>, is situated
on <em class="emphasis">Inbetween</em> and <em class="emphasis">Outside</em>.
This host mediates all interaction between
<em class="emphasis">Inside</em> and the Internet.
<em class="emphasis">Inside</em> can only talk to
<em class="emphasis">Inbetween</em>, and the Internet can only talk to
<em class="emphasis">Outside</em>.</p><blockquote>




<a name="FOOTNOTE-61" /><p>[61]<em class="emphasis">Nonrouting</em> means that it won't
forward packets between its two networks. That is, it doesn't
act as a router.</p>

<a name="ch13-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.4.2.1. Advantages</h3>





<p>Administrators of the bastion host have more or less complete
control, not only over network traffic but also over how it is
handled. They can decide which packets are permitted (with the packet
filter) and also, for those that are permitted, what software on the
bastion host can receive them. Also, since many administrators of
corporate sites do not trust their users further than they can throw
them, they treat <em class="filename">Inside</em> as if it were just as
dangerous as <em class="filename">Outside</em>.</p>
</div>









<a name="ch13-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">13.4.2.2. Disadvantages</h3>





<p>Separate networks take a lot of work to configure and administer,
although an increasing number of firewall products are available that
may ease the labor. The problem is to bridge the various pieces of
software to cause it to work somehow via an intermediate machine, in
this case the bastion host. It is difficult to be more specific
without going into unwieldy detail, but HTTP, for instance, can be
bridged by running an HTTP proxy and configuring the browser
appropriately, as we saw in <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Proxy Server"</a>. These days,
most software can be made to work by appropriate configuration in
conjunction with a proxy running on the bastion host, or else it
works transparently. For example, <a name="INDEX-1131" />
<a name="INDEX-1132" />Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
is already designed to hop from host to host, so it is able to
traverse firewalls without modification. Very occasionally, you may
find some Internet software impossible to bridge if it uses a
proprietary protocol and you do not have access to the client's
source code.</p>





<p>SMTP works by looking for <a name="INDEX-1133" /> <a name="INDEX-1134" />Mail Exchange (MX) records in the DNS
corresponding to the destination. So, for example, if you send mail
to our son and brother Adam<a href="#FOOTNOTE-62">[62]</a> at
<em class="email">adam@aldigital.algroup.co.uk</em>, an address that is
protected by a firewall, the DNS entry looks like this:</p><blockquote>




<a name="FOOTNOTE-62" /><p>[62]That is, he's the
son of one of us and the brother of the other.</p>

<p>What does all this mean? The <tt class="literal">MX</tt> records have
destinations (<em class="filename">knievel </em>and
<em class="filename">arachnet</em>) and priorities (5 and 7). This means
"try <em class="filename">knievel</em> first; if that fails, try
<em class="filename">arachnet</em>." For anyone outside the
firewall, <em class="filename">knievel</em> always fails, because it is
behind the firewall<a href="#FOOTNOTE-63">[63]</a> (on <em class="filename">Inside </em>and
<em class="filename">Inbetween</em>), so mail is sent to
<em class="filename">arachnet</em>, which does the same thing (in fact,
because <em class="filename">knievel</em> is one of the hosts mentioned,
it tries it first, then gives up). But it is able to send to
<em class="filename">knievel</em>, because <em class="emphasis">knievel</em> is
on <em class="filename">Inbetween</em>. Thus, Adam's mail gets
delivered. This mechanism was designed to deal with hosts that are
temporarily down or multiple mail delivery routes, but it adapts
easily to firewall traversal.</p><blockquote>




<a name="FOOTNOTE-63" /><p>[63]We know this because one of the
authors (BL) is the firewall administrator for this particular
system, but, even if we didn't, we'd have a big clue
because the network address for <em class="emphasis">knievel</em> is on
the network 192.168.254, which is a "throwaway" (RFC
1918) net and thus not permitted to connect to the Internet.</p>

<p>This affects the Apache user in three ways:</p>





<ul><li><p>Apache may be used as a proxy so that internal users can get onto the
Web.</p></li><li><p>The firewall may have to be configured to allow Apache to be
accessed. This might involve permitting access to port 80, the
standard HTTP port.</p></li><li><p>Where Apache can run may be limited, since it has to be on<a name="INDEX-1135" /> <a name="INDEX-1136" /> <a name="INDEX-1137" />
