<h2 class="sect1">4.12. Manual Pages</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-1111" />
<a name="INDEX-1112" />
The most empowering information you can get is how to conduct
your own research.  Following this precept, we'll now tell you
about the online help system that comes built in to Unix systems.  It
is called manual pages, or man pages for short.</p>

<p>Actually, manual pages are not quite the boon they ought to be.  This
is because they are short and take a lot of Unix background for
granted.  Each one focuses on a particular command and rarely helps
you decide why you should use that command.  Still, they are critical.
Commands can vary slightly on different Unix systems, and the manual
pages are the most reliable way to find out what your system does.
The Linux Documentation Project deserves a lot of credit for the
incredible number of hours they have put into creating manual pages.
To find out about a command, enter a command like:
<a name="INDEX-1113" /></p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>man ls</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p> 
<a name="INDEX-1114" />
Manual pages are divided into different sections depending on what
they are for.  User commands are in section 1, Unix
system calls in section 2, and so on. The sections that will interest
you most are 1, 5 (file formats), and 8 (system administration
commands).  When you view man pages online, the section numbers are
conceptual; you can optionally specify them when searching for a command:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>man 1 ls</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>But if you consult a hard-copy manual, you'll find it divided into
actual sections according to the numbering scheme.  Sometimes an entry
in two different sections can have the same name.  (For instance,
<tt class="command">chmod</tt> is both a command and a system call.)  So you
will sometimes see the name of a manual page followed by the section
number in parentheses, as in <tt class="command">ls(1)</tt>.</p>

<?troff .wcon_off?><p>There is one situation in which you will need the section 
	  number on the command line: when there
	  are several manual pages for the same keyword (e.g., one for a
	  command with that name and one for a system function with the
	  same name). Suppose you want to look up a library call, but
	  the <tt class="command">man</tt> shows you the command because its
	  default search order looks for the command first. In order
	  to see the manual page for the library call, you need to
	  give its section number.</p>

<p>Look near the top of a manual page.  The first heading is <tt class="literal">NAME</tt>. Under
it is a brief one-line description of the item.  These descriptions
can be valuable if you're not quite sure what you're looking for.
Think of a word related to what you want, and specify it in an
<tt class="command">apropos</tt> command:</p>

<a name="INDEX-1115" /><blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>apropos edit</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>The previous command shows all the manual pages that have something
to do with editing.  It's a very simple algorithm: <tt class="command">apropos</tt>
simply prints out all the <tt class="literal">NAME</tt> lines that contain the string you ask
for.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1116" />
An X Window System application, <tt class="command">xman</tt>, also helps you browse

manual pages.  It is described in the section
"<a href="ch11_04.htm">Section 11.4.9, "xman: A Point-and-Click Interface to Manual Pages"</a>" in <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, "Customizing Your X Environment"</a>.</p>

<p>
 

 <a name="INDEX-1117" />
Like commands, manual pages are sometimes installed in strange places.
 
 
For instance, you may install some site-specific programs in the
directory <em class="filename">/usr/local</em>, and put their manual pages in
<em class="filename">/usr/local/man</em>.  The <tt class="command">man</tt> command will not automatically look in
<em class="filename">/usr/local/man</em>, so when you ask for a manual page you may get
the message "No manual entry."  Fix this by specifying all the top
<em class="filename">man</em> directories in a variable called MANPATH.  For example (you
have to put in the actual directories where the manual pages are on
your system):</p>

<a name="INDEX-1118" /><blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>export MANPATH=/usr/man:/usr/local/man</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>The syntax is like PATH, described earlier in this chapter.  Each two
directories are separated by a colon.  If your shell is <tt class="command">csh</tt> or
<tt class="command">tcsh</tt>, you need to say:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>setenv MANPATH /usr/man:/usr/local/man</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>Have you read some manual pages and still found yourself confused?
They're not meant to be introductions to new topics.  Get yourself a
good beginner's book about Unix, and come back to manual pages
gradually as you become more comfortable on the system; then they'll
be irreplaceable.</p>

<p>Manual pages are not the only source of information on
	  Unix systems. Programs from the
<a name="INDEX-1119" />
<a name="INDEX-1120" />
	  <span class="acronym">GNU</span> project often have Info pages
	  that you read with the program <tt class="command">info</tt>. For
	  example, to read the Info pages for the command
	  <tt class="command">find</tt>, you would enter:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">info find</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="command">info</tt> program is arcane and
	  has lots of navigation features; to learn it, your best bet will be to type
	  Ctrl-H in the <tt class="command">info</tt> program and read through
	  the help screen. Fortunately, there are also programs that let
	  you read Info pages more easily, notably <tt class="command">tkinfo</tt>
	  and <tt class="command">kdehelp</tt>. These commands use the X
	  Window System to present a graphical interface.
	  You can also read Info pages
	  from Emacs (see the section "<a href="ch09_02.htm">Section 9.2, "The Emacs Editor"</a>" in <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Editors, Text Tools,
 Graphics,
 and Printing"</a>) or use the command
	  <tt class="command">pinfo</tt> available on some Linux distributions
	  that works more like the Lynx web browser.</p>

<p>In recent times, more and more documentation is provided
	  in the form of HTML pages. You can read those with any web
	  browser (see <a href="ch16_01.htm">Chapter 16, "The World Wide Web and
 Electronic Mail"</a>). For
	  example, in Netscape Navigator, you select "Open
	  Page..." from the "File" menu and press the 
	  "Choose File" button, which opens an ordinary file
	  selection dialog where you can select your documentation
	  file.</p>
