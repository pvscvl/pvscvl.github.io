<h2 class="sect1">10.5. Filling in Video Card Information</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-2233" />
<a name="INDEX-2234" />
Your <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file is now ready to go with the exception of
complete information on the video card. What we're going to do is
use the X server to probe for the rest of this information and fill it
into <em class="filename">XF86Config</em>.</p>

<p>Instead of probing for this information with the X server, you can
find the
<em class="filename">XF86Config</em> values for many cards in the files
<em class="filename">modeDB.txt</em>, <em class="filename">AccelCards</em>, and <em class="filename">Devices</em>. These files
are all in <em class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</em>. In addition, there
are various <em class="filename">README</em> files for certain chipsets. You should
look in these files for information on your video card, and use
that information (the clock values, chipset type, and any options)
in the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file. Unfortunately,  some manufacturers put out a graphics board with a new chipset without changing the board's name. If any
information is missing, you can probe for it as described here.</p>

<p>In these examples, we will demonstrate configuration for a 
#9 <span class="acronym">GXE</span> 64 video card, which uses the XF86_S3 chipset.
This card happens to be the one that used by one of the authors, but
the discussion here applies to any video card.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2235" />
The first thing to do is to determine the video chipset used on the card.
Running <tt class="command">SuperProbe</tt> (found in <em class="filename">/usr/X11R6/bin</em>) will tell you
this information, but you need to know the chipset name as it is known to
the X server.</p>

<p>To do this, run the command:
<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>X -showconfig</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

This lists the chipset names known to your X server. (The manual pages
for each X server list these as well.)  For example, with the
accelerated XF86_S3 server, we obtain:
<blockquote><pre class="code">XFree86 Version 3.3.3.1 / X Window System
(protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6000)
Release Date: March 2 1998
        If the server is older than 6-12 months, or if your card is newer
        than the above date, look for a newer version before reporting
        problems.  (see http://www.XFree86.Org/FAQ)
Operating System: Linux 2.0.33 i686 [ELF]
Configured drivers:
  S3: accelerated server for S3 graphics adaptors (Patchlevel 0)
      newmmio, mmio_928, s3_generic</pre></blockquote></p>

<p>The valid chipset names for this server are
<tt class="literal">newmmio</tt>, <tt class="literal">mmio_928</tt>, and 
<tt class="literal">s3_generic</tt>. The XF86_S3 manual
page describes these chipsets 
and which video cards use them. In the case of the #9
<span class="acronym">GXE</span> 64 video card, <tt class="literal">mmio_928</tt> is
appropriate.</p>

<p>If you don't know which chipset to use, the X server can probe it 
for you. To do this, run the command:
<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>X -probeonly &gt; /tmp/x.out 2&gt;&amp;1</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

if you use <tt class="command">bash</tt> as your shell. If you use <tt class="command">csh</tt>, try:
<blockquote><pre class="code">% <tt class="userinput"><b>X -probeonly &gt;&amp; /tmp/x.out</b></tt></pre></blockquote></p>

<p>You should run this command while the system is unloaded, that is,
while no other activity is occurring on the system. This command also
probes for your video-card dot clocks (as seen later), and system load can 
throw off this calculation.</p>

<p>The output from this  command (in <em class="filename">/tmp/x.out</em>) should contain lines such
as the following:
<blockquote><pre class="code">XFree86 Version 3.3.3.1 / X Window System 
(protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6000) 
Operating System: Linux  

Configured drivers: 
  S3: accelerated server for S3 graphics adaptors (Patchlevel 0) 
      newmmio, mmio_928, s3_generic 
         .
         .
         .
(- -) S3: card type: 386/486 localbus 
(- -) S3: chipset:   864 rev. 0 
(- -) S3: chipset driver: mmio_928</pre></blockquote>

Here, we see that the three valid chipsets for this server
(XF86_S3) are <tt class="literal">newmmio</tt>,
<tt class="literal">mmio_928</tt> and <tt class="literal">s3_generic</tt>. The
server probed for and found a video card using the
<tt class="literal">mmio_928</tt> chipset driver.</p>

<p>In the <tt class="literal">Device</tt> section of the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file, add a <tt class="literal">Chipset</tt> 
line containing the name of the chipset you determined earlier. For example:
<blockquote><pre class="code">Section "Device" 
        # We already had Identifier here...
        Identifier "#9 GXE 64"  
        # Add this line:
        Chipset "mmio_928"
EndSection</pre></blockquote></p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2236" />
<a name="INDEX-2237" />
Now we need to determine
which dot clocks are made available by the video card. First, you should look into the files (<em class="filename">modeDB.txt</em> and so forth) 
mentioned at the beginning of this section and see if your card's clocks are listed there. 
The dot clocks will usually be a list of 8 or 16 values, all of which
are in MHz. For example, when looking at <em class="filename">mode-DB.txt</em>, we see an
entry for the Cardinal ET4000 video board, which looks like this:
<blockquote><pre class="code"># chip    RAM   virtual   clocks   default-mode  flags
 ET4000   1024  1024 768   25  28  38  36  40  45  32   0  "1024x768"</pre></blockquote>

As we can see, the dot clocks for this card are 25, 28, 38, 36, 40, 45, 32, 
and 0 MHz.</p>

<p>In the <tt class="literal">Devices</tt> section of the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file, you should
add a <tt class="literal">Clocks</tt> line containing the list of dot clocks for your card.
For example, for the clocks in this example, we would add the line:
<blockquote><pre class="code">         Clocks 25 28 38 36 40 45 32 0</pre></blockquote>

to the <tt class="literal">Devices</tt> section of the file, after <tt class="literal">Chipset</tt>.
The order of the clocks is important! Don't re-sort the list
of clocks or remove duplicates.</p>

<p>If you cannot find the dot clocks associated with your card, the X server
can probe for these as well. Using the <tt class="command">X -probeonly</tt> command described
earlier, the output should contain lines that look like the following:
<blockquote><pre class="code">(- -) S3: clocks:  25.18  28.32  38.02  36.15  40.33  45.32  32.00  00.00</pre></blockquote>

We could then add a <tt class="literal">Clocks</tt> line containing all of these values,
as printed. You can use more than one <tt class="literal">Clocks</tt> line in <tt class="command">XF86Config</tt>
if all the values (sometimes there are more than eight clock values
printed) don't fit onto one line. Again, be sure to keep the list of clocks
in the order that they are printed.</p>

<p>Be sure there is no <tt class="literal">Clocks</tt> line (or that it is commented out)
in the <tt class="literal">Devices</tt> section of the file when using <tt class="command">X -probeonly</tt>
to probe for the clocks. If there is a <tt class="literal">Clocks</tt> line present, the
server will not probe for the clocks; it will use the values
given in <em class="filename">XF86Config</em>.</p>

<p>Note that some accelerated video boards use a programmable clock chip.
(See the XF86_Accel manual page for details; this generally applies
to S3, <span class="acronym">AGX</span>, and <span class="acronym">XGA</span>-2 boards.)
This chip essentially allows the X server to tell the card which dot clocks
to use. If this is the case, you may not find a list of dot clocks
for the card in any of the files mentioned earlier. Or the list of dot clocks printed
when using <tt class="command">X -probeonly</tt> will contain only one or two discrete clock 
values, with the rest being duplicates or zero.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2238" />
For boards that use a programmable clock chip, you would use a 
<tt class="literal">ClockChip</tt> line, instead of a
<tt class="literal">Clocks</tt> line, in your 
<em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file. <tt class="literal">ClockChip</tt>
gives the name of the clock chip as used by the video card. But in
most cases, the X server can detect your clock chip 
automatically and find the correct entry itself.</p>

<p>If you are not so lucky, the manual pages for each server describe
the possible values for your server.
For example, in the file <em class="filename">README.S3</em>, we see that 
several S3-864 video cards use an ICD2061A clock chip,
and that we should use the line:
<blockquote><pre class="code">ClockChip "icd2061a"</pre></blockquote>

<?troff .ne 10?>
instead of <tt class="literal">Clocks</tt> in the
<em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file. As with
<tt class="literal">Clocks</tt>, this line should go in the
<tt class="literal">Devices</tt> section after <tt class="literal">Chipset</tt>.</p>

<p>Similarly, some accelerated cards require you to specify the <span class="acronym">RAMDAC</span> chip
type in the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file, using a <tt class="literal">Ramdac</tt> line.
The XF86_Accel manual page describes this option. Usually, the X
server will correctly probe for the <span class="acronym">RAMDAC</span>.</p>

<p>Some video card types require you to specify several options in the 
<tt class="literal">Devices</tt> section of <em class="filename">XF86Config</em>. These options will be 
described in the manual page for your server, as well as in the various
files (such as <em class="filename">README.cirrus</em> or <em class="filename">README.S3</em>). These options
are enabled using the <tt class="literal">Option</tt> line. For example, the
#9 <span class="acronym">GXE</span> 64 card requires the option:
<blockquote><pre class="code">Option "number_nine"</pre></blockquote>

Usually, the X server works without these options, but they are
necessary to obtain the best performance. There are too many such options
to list here, and they each depend on the particular video card being
used. If you must use one of these options, fear not: the X server
manual pages and various files in <em class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</em> will
tell you what they are.</p>

<p>So when you're finished, you should end up with a <tt class="literal">Devices</tt>
section that looks something like this:
<blockquote><pre class="code">Section "Device"  
        # Device section for the #9 GXE 64 only !
        Identifier "#9 GXE 64" 
        Chipset "mmio_928" 
        ClockChip "icd2061a" 
        Option "number_nine" 
EndSection</pre></blockquote>

This <tt class="literal">Device</tt> entry
is valid only for a particular video card, the #9 GXE 64; it is 
given here only as an example.  Most video cards require a
<tt class="literal">Clocks</tt> line, instead of
<tt class="literal">ClockChip</tt>.</p>

<p>There are other options you can include in the <tt class="literal">Devices</tt> 
entry. Check the X server manual pages for the gritty details, but the
explanation in this section should suffice for most systems.</p>
