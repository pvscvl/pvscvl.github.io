<h2 class="sect1">13.7. Other Languages</h2>

<p>There are many other popular (and not-so-popular) languages available
for Linux. For the most part, however, these work identically on Linux as
on other Unix systems, so there's not much in the way of
news there. There are also so many of them that we can't cover them 
in much detail here. We do want to let you know what's out
there, however, and explain some of the differences between the
various languages and compilers.</p>

<p>Python has gained a lot of attention lately, because it is 
<a name="INDEX-2763" />
<a name="INDEX-2764" />
	  a powerful mixture of different programming paradigms and
	  styles. For example, it is one of the very few interpreted
	  object-oriented programming languages (Perl being another
	  example, but only relatively late in its existence). Python fans
	  say it is especially easily 
	  learned. Python was almost entirely written and designed by
	  Guido van Rossum, who chose the name because he wrote the
	  interpreter while watching reruns of the British TV show <em class="emphasis">Monty Python's Flying Circus</em>. You can read
	  all about Python at <a href="../../../../../../www.python.org/">http://www.python.org</a>
	  or in <em class="emphasis">Programming Python</em> by Mark Lutz.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2765" />
<a name="INDEX-2766" />
<span class="acronym">LISP</span> is an interpreted language used in many
applications, ranging from
artificial intelligence to statistics. It is used primarily
in computer science, because it defines a clean, logical interface for
working with algorithms. (It also uses a lot of parentheses,
something computer scientists are always fond of.) It is a functional 
programming language
and is very generalized. Many operations are defined in terms of recursion
instead of linear loops. Expressions are hierarchical, and data is
represented by lists of items.</p>

<p>There are several <span class="acronym">LISP</span> interpreters available for
Linux. Emacs <span class="acronym">LISP</span> is a fairly complete
implementation in itself. It has many features that allow
it to interact directly with Emacs--input and output through Emacs
buffers, for example--but it may be used for non-Emacs-related
applications as well.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2767" />
Also available is <span class="acronym">CLISP</span>, a Common
<span class="acronym">LISP</span> implementation by Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe
University and Michael Stoll of Munich University. It includes an
interpreter, a compiler, and a subset of <span class="acronym">CLOS</span>
(Common LISP Object System, an object-oriented extension to
LISP). <span class="acronym">CLX</span>, a Common <span class="acronym">LISP</span>
interface to the X Window System, is also available, and it runs under
<span class="acronym">CLISP</span>. <span class="acronym">CLX</span> allows you to write
X-based applications in <span class="acronym">LISP</span>. Austin Kyoto Common
<span class="acronym">LISP</span>, another <span class="acronym">LISP</span>
implementation, is available and compatible with
<span class="acronym">CLX</span> as well.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2768" />
<span class="acronym">SWI</span>-Prolog, a complete Prolog implementation by Jan
Wielemaker of the University of Amsterdam, is also available. Prolog
is a logic-based language, allowing you to make logical assertions, define heuristics for validating those assertions, and make
decisions based on them. It is a useful language for AI applications.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2769" /> 
<a name="INDEX-2770" />
Also available are several Scheme interpreters, including <span class="acronym">MIT</span> Scheme,
a complete Scheme interpreter conforming to the
R<sup class="superscript">4</sup> standard.  Scheme is a dialect of
<span class="acronym">LISP</span> that offers a cleaner, more general programming
model. It is a good <span class="acronym">LISP</span> dialect for
computer-science applications and for studying algorithms.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2771" />
<a name="INDEX-2772" />
<a name="INDEX-2773" />

At least two implementations of Ada are available--AdaEd, an Ada
interpreter, and <span class="acronym">GNAT</span>, the <span class="acronym">GNU</span>
Ada Translator.  <span class="acronym">GNAT</span> is actually a full-fledged
optimizing Ada compiler.  It is to Ada what <tt class="command">gcc</tt> is
to C and C++.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2774" />
<a name="INDEX-2775" />
<a name="INDEX-2776" />
<a name="INDEX-2777" />
<a name="INDEX-2778" />
<a name="INDEX-2779" />

Along the same vein, two other popular language translators exist for
Linux--<tt class="command">p2c</tt>, a Pascal-to-C translator, and
<tt class="command">f2c</tt>, a <span class="acronym">FORTRAN</span>-to-C
translator. If you're concerned that these translators won't function
as well as bona fide compilers, don't be. Both <tt class="command">p2c</tt>
and <tt class="command">f2c</tt> have proven to be robust and useful for
heavy Pascal and <span class="acronym">FORTRAN</span> use.</p>

<p><tt class="command">f2c</tt> is <span class="acronym">FORTRAN</span>-77-compliant, and
a number of tools are available for it as
well. <tt class="command">ftnchek</tt> is a <span class="acronym">FORTRAN</span>
checker, similar to <tt class="command">lint</tt>. Both the
<span class="acronym">LAPACK</span> numerical methods library and the
<em class="filename">mpfun</em> multiprecision <span class="acronym">FORTRAN</span>
library have been ported to Linux using
<tt class="command">f2c</tt>. <tt class="command">toolpack</tt> is a collection of
<span class="acronym">FORTRAN</span> tools, such as a source-code pretty-printer,
a precision converter, and a portability checker.</p>

<p>Among the miscellaneous other languages available for Linux are
interpreters for <span class="acronym">APL</span>, Rexx, Forth, ML, Eiffel, and a
Simula-to-C translator.  The <span class="acronym">GNU</span> versions of the
compiler tools <tt class="command">lex</tt> and <tt class="command">yacc</tt>
(renamed to <tt class="command">flex</tt> and <tt class="command">bison</tt>,
respectively), which are used for many software packages, have also
been ported to Linux. <tt class="command">lex</tt> 
and <tt class="command">yacc</tt> are invaluable for creating any kind of
parser or translator, most commonly used when writing compilers.
