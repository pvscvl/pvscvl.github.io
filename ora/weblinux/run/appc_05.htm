<h2 class="sect1">C.5. Preparing for Installation
 of Linux Alpha</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-117" />
<a name="INDEX-118" />
We can now return to the steps we listed earlier to get
Linux running.  You must also decide how you want your Alpha to
boot after Linux is installed and configured; Alpha systems support a
number of alternatives.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.5.1. Minimum Hardware</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-119" />
<a name="INDEX-120" />
You can run Linux on Alpha systems using as little as 8 MB of RAM, but
most installation programs, like the Red Hat installer, require a minimum of
32 MB. The mininum disk space for the installation is 170 MB.  To run
the full X Window System and a desktop comfortably and have adequate
storage for applications, you need a minimum of 16 MB RAM and 500 MB of
hard-disk storage.</p>

<p>Many users of more recent Linux distributions have found that 24 MB or
32 MB of RAM is required to complete the installation.  While it
should still require no more than 16 MB to run Linux on a properly
configured Alpha system (with a kernel compiled to support just that
system's features), you may need more memory to install some
distributions.  An alternative is to install an earlier, smaller
kernel.</p>

<p>Installation takes a huge amount of RAM because of the combined memory
requirements of the bootstrap loader and Milo and the loading
Linux kernel image, not because of the memory requirements of the
Linux kernel itself.  If you cannot complete your initial
installation, you can also try to use an earlier and smaller Milo to
boot your Linux distribution or a Milo that has been stored in
nonvolatile RAM. You can select compact applications to conserve
memory and storage.  For more information, see <a href="../../../../../../www.alphalinux.org/">http://www.alphalinux.org</a>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.5.2. IDE/ATAPI Drive Support</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-121" />
<a name="INDEX-122" />
Some Alpha systems, especially those intended for use as network
servers, do not support IDE or ATAPI drives.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a>
We recommend a fast SCSI drive as a basic system element, whether
installed internally or attached externally. However, if your
<?troff \p?> system
has a free PCI slot, add a current PCIbus ATAPI/EIDE
controller card supported by Linux so that you can also use a cheaper EIDE
hard disk or fast CD-ROM drive. See the next section for more details on firmware
limitations.</p><blockquote>

<a name="FOOTNOTE-7" /><p>[7]Early Alpha systems provided 10 mbps SCSI-2, and some of the latest
Alpha system boards provide "fast and wide" 40 mbps SCSI-3.  The very
earliest (Jensen) provided an Adaptec 1740 ISA bus controller, but
most SCSI controllers are integral NCR 810 family controllers that
were considered high-performance controllers when adopted.</p>

</blockquote>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.5.3. Firmware/BIOS Peripheral Device Support</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-123" />
<a name="INDEX-124" />
<a name="INDEX-125" />
<a name="INDEX-126" />
Alpha systems recognize a number of peripheral devices through a
configurable native Alpha system BIOS.  The devices recognized vary,
depending on whether the system was initially set up to run Windows NT, DU, or
VMS.</p>

<p>Milo incorporates code from the original Windows NT firmware console for Windows NT
systems, and ARC.  An SRM console is provided for DU and VMS systems.  If
you install Linux using default system devices, you shouldn't have problems, but if you need to tailor the system to support your
input device, you will find installation more complex. One list
of supported peripherals in current Alpha systems is the "Hardware
<?troff .ne 10?>
Compatibility List" in Samsung Semiconductor's <em class="emphasis">Alpha Resource Book</em>,
found at <a href="../../../../../../www.samsungsemi.com/Products/alpha/alpha-page1.html">http://www.samsungsemi.com/Products/alpha/alpha-page1.html</a>.</p>

<p>If your system was set up for VMS, install system firmware
for Windows NT or DU before installing Linux. Any SRM firmware from VMS should
be replaced by SRM firmware for DU.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.5.4. Updated Firmware</h3>

<p>Your system firmware (ARC, AlphaBIOS, or SRM) should be
up to date.  In many cases, it won't matter whether it is an older
version. But generally, we recommend updating your firmware
before installing Linux.  In the case of AlphaBIOS software, updating
is expected and necessary.</p>

<p>Follow your hardware manual's directions for upgrading firmware. You can get firmware upgrades from <a href="../../../../../../ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/">http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/</a>.</p>

<p>Some users advise you not to update firmware unless you know you need
to do so.  In other words, you can upgrade firmware if Linux fails to
install properly on your system.  Indeed, some Linux installations
require some systems to be "downgraded" to an earlier firmware
version to succeed.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">C.5.5. Mice and Serial Ports</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-127" />
<a name="INDEX-128" />
<a name="INDEX-129" />
A commonly reported problem in Linux installations is
connecting a serial mouse to the system.  Some Linux installation
programs map device definitions to the serial ports incorrectly during
kernel configuration. Most of these complaints involve autodetection
of a mouse installed on the first serial port.  We recommend that you
install a three-button PS/2-type mouse, if your system has a PS/2 hardware
port rather than a serial mouse. Moreover, do not put a modem on
serial port 1 as Milo will echo its output to serial port 1 and this
can cause some strange results.</p>
