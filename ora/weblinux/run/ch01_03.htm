<h2 class="sect1">1.3. Who's Using Linux?</h2>

<p>Application developers, system administrators, network providers,
kernel hackers, multimedia
authors: these are a few of the categories of people who find that
Linux has a particular charm.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-407" />
Unix programmers are increasingly using Linux
because of its cost--they can pick up a complete programming
environment for a few dollars and run it on cheap PC hardware--and because Linux 
<?troff .ne 10?>offers a great basis for portable
programs.  It's a modern operating system that is
<span class="acronym">POSIX</span>-compliant and looks a lot like System V, so
code that works on Linux should work on other contemporary systems.
Linux on a modest PC runs faster than many Unix
workstations.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-408" />
<a name="INDEX-409" />
Networking is one of Linux's strengths.  It has been adopted with
gusto by people who run community networks like Free-Nets or who want
to connect nonprofit organizations or loose communities of users
through <span class="acronym">UUCP</span>.  Linux makes a good hub for such
networks.  Since Linux also supports Network File System (<span class="acronym">NFS</span>) and Network Information Service
(<span class="acronym">NIS</span>), you can easily merge a personal computer into
a corporate or academic network with other Unix
machines.  It's easy to share files, support remote logins, and run
applications on other systems. Linux also supports the Samba software
suite, which allows a Linux machine to act as a Windows file and print
server--many people are discovering that the combination of Linux
and Samba for this purpose is faster (and cheaper) than running Windows
NT.</p>

<p>Kernel hackers were the first to come to Linux--in fact, the
ones who helped Linus Torvalds create Linux--and are still a
formidable community.  If you want to try tuning buffer sizes and the
number of table entries to make your applications run a little faster,
Linux is one of your best choices.  You'll get a lot of sympathy on
the Net when things go wrong, too.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-410" />
Finally, Linux is becoming an exciting forum for multimedia.  This is
because it's compatible with an enormous variety of hardware,
including the majority of modern sound and video cards.  Several
programming environments, including the MESA
3D toolkit (a free OpenGL implementation), have been ported to Linux.
The <span class="acronym">GIMP</span> (a free Adobe Photoshop work-alike)
was originally developed under Linux, and is becoming the graphics
manipulation and design tool of choice for many artists. For example,
during the production of the movie "Titanic," Linux
machines (with Alpha processors) were used to render some of the trick
effects.</p>

<p>Linux has also had some real-world applications.
Linux systems have traveled the high seas of the
North Pacific, managing telecommunications and data analysis for an
oceanographic research vessel.  Linux systems are being used at
research stations in Antarctica. On a more basic level,
several hospitals are using Linux to maintain patient records. One of
the reviewers of this book uses Linux in the U.S. Marine Corps.
Linux is proving to be as reliable and useful as other implementations
of Unix.</p>

<p>So Linux is spreading out in many directions.  Even naive end users
can enjoy it if they get the support universities and
corporations typically provide their computer users.
Configuration and maintenance require
some dedication.  But Linux proves to be cost-effective, powerful, and
empowering for people who like having that extra control over their
environments.</p>
