<p>Linux/m68k is the port of the Linux operating system to the Motorola
680x0 (or m68k) processors.  Linux/m68k, the first project to port
Linux to a non-Intel processor, was begun in 1993 by Hamish Macdonald
and Greg Harp, who ported the kernel to the Amiga.  Several Atari
users, including Bj&ouml;rn Brauel, Roman Hodek, and Andreas Schwab,
adapted Hamish's kernel beginning later that year to run on Atari's
32-bit ST series of computers.

<p>Since 1996, Linux/m68k has been adapted to run on a number of other
systems, including the pre-PowerPC Apple Macintosh line, several
models of VMEbus single-board computers from Motorola and BVM Ltd.,
Apollo Domain workstations, the HP 9000 series and Sun 3 workstations,
and NeXT.  Most recently, there has been a port to the Q40 and Q60,
two new 680x0-based computers that are being manufactured in Europe.
A related project, Linux/APUS, has ported Linux/PPC (discussed in
<a href="appd_01.htm">Appendix D, "LinuxPPC: Installing Linux
 on PowerPC Computers"</a>) to Amigas with PowerPC
processor cards; it is very much a hybrid of Linux/m68k and Linux/PPC.</p>

<p>As you can see from the diverse list of systems that Linux/m68k runs
on, the challenge facing the m68k port was introducing enough flexibility into the kernel to cope with the
variety of possible environments.  Many of these
abstractions--most notably, Martin Schaller and Geert
Uytterhoeven's framebuffer and console abstractions--have since
been incorporated into the mainstream kernel.  These abstractions have
meant that virtually every binary ever written for
Linux/m68k--including the kernel image itself--can be run on
every m68k platform without recompilation.</p>

<p>Linux/m68k has proven its robustness in the real world: several
publicly accessible web servers, such as <a href="../../../../../../shadow.cabi.net/">http://shadow.cabi.net</a> and <a href="../../../../../../amiga.nvg.org/">http://amiga.nvg.org</a>, are running on
Linux/m68k and one of the developers uses an Amiga running Linux as a
web and mail server for his dormitory.  Thousands of other users use
Linux for myriad tasks from software development to text processing to
academic research.</p>

<p>Linux, along with other free Unix clones, continues to provide m68k
users with a dynamic, rapidly improving operating system not seen on
these platforms since the heyday of the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>

<blockquote><h4 class="objtitle">NOTE</h4>
<p>Apple's choice of the name MkLinux for its microkernel-based Linux
for PowerPCs and other platforms has caused no end of confusion; this
confusion has been further compounded because an early port of Linux to the
m68k Macs (now believed to be vapor as no code has ever been released) was
called MacLinux.</p>

<p>The correct name for Linux on 680x0 processors is Linux/m68k; in
particular, Linux for the pre-PowerPC Macintoshes should be called
Linux/m68k for the Macintosh to avoid confusion with other projects.
Neither of these is based on the microkernel or MkLinux.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">E.1. Software Versions</h2>

<p>As of this writing, active development of the 2.0 kernel series has
stopped; the focus is now on producing a rock-solid 2.2 kernel in the
near future. The latest Linux/m68k kernels can always be downloaded
at <a href="../../../../../../sunsite.auc.dk /ftp/projects/680x0/">http://sunsite.auc.dk/ftp/projects/680x0/</a>;
precompiled images are provided for stable kernels, and complete
source trees and patches (relative to both previous versions and
Linus's releases) are available for all versions.</p>

<p>Like other platforms, Linux/m68k has followed the <tt class="command">libc</tt> roller coaster
closely; thanks to the hard work of Andreas Schwab, our resident <tt class="command">gcc</tt>
and <tt class="command">libc</tt> guru, we've never been left too far behind.  At present, both
major distributions ship with <tt class="command">glibc</tt> 2.0 (<tt class="command">libc</tt> 6); work is underway to
prepare for the transition to <tt class="command">glibc</tt> 2.1 (<tt class="command">libc</tt> 6.1) in upcoming releases
of Linux/m68k distributions.  However, the kernel still supports both
<tt class="command">libc</tt> 4 and <tt class="command">libc</tt> 5 applications, for those users who need them.</p>
