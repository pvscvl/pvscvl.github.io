<h2 class="sect1">2.2. Preparing to Install Linux</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-660" />
<a name="INDEX-661" />
After you have obtained a distribution of Linux, you're ready to
prepare your system for installation. This takes a certain degree of
planning, especially if you're already running other operating
systems. In the following sections, we'll describe how to plan for the
Linux installation.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.2.1. Installation Overview</h3>

<p>While each release of Linux is different, in general the method used to
install the software is as follows:</p>

<ol><li><p><em class="emphasis">Repartition your hard
drive(s)</em>. If you have other operating systems already
installed, you will need to repartition the drives in order to
allocate space for Linux. This is discussed in the section
"<a href="ch02_02.htm">Section 2.2.4, "Repartitioning Your Drives"</a>" later in
this chapter. In some distributions, this step is integrated into the
installation procedure. Check the documentation of your distribution
to see whether this is the case. Still, it won't hurt you to follow
the steps given here and repartition your hard drive in advance.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Boot the Linux installation
media.</em> Each distribution of Linux has some kind of
installation media--usually a "boot
floppy"--or a bootable <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> that is
used to install the software. Booting 
this media will either present you with some kind of installation
program, which will step you through the Linux installation, or allow
you to install the software by hand.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Create Linux partitions.</em> After repartitioning to allocate
space for Linux, you
create Linux partitions on that empty space. This is accomplished with
the Linux <tt class="command">fdisk</tt>
program, covered in the section
"<a href="ch03_01.htm">Section 3.1.3, "Creating Linux Partitions"</a>" in

<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Installation
 and Initial
 Configuration"</a> or some other
distribution-specific program like the <tt class="command">Disk Druid</tt>
that comes with Red Hat Linux.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Create filesystems and swap
space.</em> At this point, you will create one or more
filesystems, used to store files, on the newly
created partitions. In addition, if you plan to use swap space, you
will create the swap space on one of your Linux partitions.  This is
covered in the sections
"<a href="ch03_01.htm">Section 3.1.4, "Creating Swap Space"</a>"
and "<a href="ch03_01.htm">Section 3.1.5, "Creating the Filesystems"</a>,"
both in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Installation
 and Initial
 Configuration"</a>.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Install the software on the new filesystems.</em> Finally, you will
install the Linux software on your newly created filesystems. After this,
if all goes well, it's smooth sailing. This is covered in
the section
"<a href="ch03_01.htm">Section 3.1.6, "Installing the Software"</a>" in
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Installation
 and Initial
 Configuration"</a>.
Later, in the section
"<a href="ch03_03.htm">Section 3.3, "Running Into Trouble"</a>,"
also in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Installation
 and Initial
 Configuration"</a>,
we describe what to do if anything goes wrong.</p></li></ol><p />

<p><a name="INDEX-662" />
People who want to switch back and forth between different
operating systems sometimes wonder which to install first: Linux
or the other system?  We can testify that some people have had
trouble installing Windows 95 after Linux.  Windows 95 tends to
wipe out existing boot information when it's installed, so you're
safer installing it first and then installing Linux afterward
using the information in this chapter.</p>

<p>We don't know whether Windows 98 will demonstrate the same
cavalier behavior as Windows 95.  Windows NT seems to be more
tolerant of existing boot information.</p>

<p>Many distributions of Linux provide an installation program,
that will step you through the installation process and automate
one or more of the previous steps for you. Keep in mind throughout this
chapter and the next that any number of the previous steps may be
automated for you, depending on the distribution.</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">Important hint:</em> While preparing to install Linux,
the best advice we can give is to take notes
during the entire procedure.  Write down everything you do,
everything you type, and everything you see that might be
out of the ordinary. The idea here is simple: if (or when!) you run
into trouble, you want to be able to retrace your steps and find out
what went wrong. Installing Linux isn't difficult, but there are many
details to remember. You want to have a record of all these details
so that you can experiment with other methods if something goes
wrong. Also, keeping a notebook of your Linux installation experience
is useful when you want to ask other people for help, for example,
when posting a message to one of the Linux-related Usenet groups. Your
notebook is also something you'll want to show to your
grandchildren someday.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-13">[13]</a></p><blockquote>

<a name="FOOTNOTE-13" /><p>[13]Matt
shamefully admits that he kept a notebook of all of his tribulations
with Linux for the first few months of working with the system. It is
now gathering dust on his bookshelf.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">2.2.2. Repartitioning Concepts</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-663" />
<a name="INDEX-664" />
<a name="INDEX-665" />
<a name="INDEX-666" />
In general, hard drives are divided into
<em class="emphasis">partitions</em>, where  one or more partitions are devoted
to an operating system. For example, on one hard drive, you may
have several separate partitions--one devoted to, say,
Windows, another to OS/2, and another two to Linux.</p>

<p>If you already have other software installed on your system, you may
need to resize those partitions in order to free up space for
Linux. You will then create one or more Linux partitions on the
resulting free space for storing the Linux software and swap space. We
call this process <em class="emphasis">repartitioning</em>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-667" />
Many <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> systems utilize a single partition
inhabiting the entire drive. To <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>, this
partition is known as <tt class="literal">C:</tt>. If you have more than one
partition, <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> names them <tt class="literal">D:</tt>,
<tt class="literal">E:</tt>, and so on.

In a way, each partition acts like a separate hard drive.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-668" />
<a name="INDEX-669" />
<a name="INDEX-670" />
  On the first sector of the disk is a
<em class="emphasis">master boot record</em> along with a
<em class="emphasis">partition table</em>. The boot record (as the name
implies) is used to boot the system. The partition table contains
information about the locations and sizes of your partitions.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-671" />
There are three kinds of partitions: <em class="emphasis">primary</em>,
<em class="emphasis">extended</em>, and <em class="emphasis">logical</em>. Of
these, primary partitions are used most often.  However, because of a
limit on the size of the partition table, you can only have four
primary partitions on any given drive. This is due to the poor design
of <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>; even other operating systems of the same 
era do not have such limits.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-672" />
<a name="INDEX-673" />
The way around this four-partition limit is to use an extended
partition.  An extended partition doesn't hold any data by itself;
instead, it acts as a "container" for logical
partitions. Therefore, you could create one extended partition,
covering the entire drive, and within it create many logical
partitions. However, you may have only one extended partition per
drive.</p>
</div>




<a name="x-100-3-sec-install-linux-reqs" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.2.3. Linux Partition Requirements</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-674" />
<a name="INDEX-675" />
<a name="INDEX-676" />
<a name="INDEX-677" />
Before we explain how to
repartition your drives, you need an idea of how much space
you will be allocating for Linux.

We will be discussing how to create
these partitions later, in the section "<a href="ch03_01.htm">Section 3.1.3, "Creating Linux Partitions"</a>" in
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Installation
 and Initial
 Configuration"</a>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-678" />
On Unix systems, files are stored on a
<em class="emphasis">filesystem</em>, which is
  essentially a
section of the hard drive (or other medium, such as
<span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> or floppy) formatted to hold files. Each
filesystem is associated with a specific part of the directory tree;
for example, on many systems, there is a filesystem for all the
files in the directory <em class="filename">/usr</em>, another
for <em class="filename">/tmp</em>, and so on. The <em class="emphasis">root
filesystem</em> is the primary filesystem, which corresponds to
the topmost directory, <em class="filename">/</em>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-679" />
<a name="INDEX-680" />
<a name="INDEX-681" />
Under Linux, each filesystem lives
on a separate partition on the hard drive. For instance, if you have a
filesystem for <em class="filename">/</em> and another for
<em class="filename">/usr</em>, you will need two partitions to hold the
two filesystems.</p>

<p>Before you install Linux, you will need to prepare filesystems for
storing the Linux software. You must have at least one filesystem (the
root filesystem), and therefore one partition, allocated to Linux.
Many Linux users opt to store all their files on the root
filesystem, which, in most cases, is easier to manage than several
filesystems and partitions.</p>

<p>However, you may create multiple filesystems for Linux if you
wish--for example, you may want to use separate filesystems for
<em class="filename">/usr</em> and <em class="filename">/home</em>. Those
readers with Unix system administration experience
will know how to use multiple filesystems creatively. In

the section "<a href="ch06_01.htm">Section 6.1.4, "Creating Filesystems"</a>" in
<a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Managing
 Filesystems, Swap,
 and Devices"</a>, we discuss the use of multiple
partitions and filesystems.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-682" />
Why use more than one filesystem? The most
commonly stated reason is safety; if, for some reason, one of your
filesystems is damaged, the others will (usually) be unharmed. On the
other hand, if you store all your files on the root filesystem, and
for some reason the filesystem is damaged, you may lose all
your files in one fell swoop. 
<?troff .ne 10?>
This is, however, rather uncommon; if
you back up the system regularly, you should be quite safe.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-14">[14]</a></p><blockquote>

<a name="FOOTNOTE-14" /><p>[14]Matt uses a single 200-MB
filesystem for all his Linux files and hasn't had any problems (so
far).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, using several filesystems has the advantage that
you can easily upgrade your system without endangering your own
precious data. You might have a partition for the users' home
directories, and when upgrading the system, you leave this partition
alone, wipe out the others, and reinstall Linux from scratch. Of
course, nowadays distributions all have quite elaborate update
procedures, but from time to time, you might want a
"fresh start."</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-683" />
Another reason to use multiple filesystems is to divvy up storage
among multiple hard drives. If you have, say, 100 MB free on one hard
drive, and 2 GB free on another, you might want to create a
100-MB root filesystem on the first drive and a 2-GB
<em class="filename">/usr</em> filesystem on the other. Currently it is not
possible for a single filesystem to span multiple drives; if your free
hard drive storage is fragmented between drives, you need to use
multiple filesystems to use all the storage.</p>

<p>In summary, Linux requires at least one partition, for the root filesystem.
If you wish to create multiple filesystems, you need a separate
partition for each additional filesystem. Some distributions of Linux
automatically create partitions and filesystems for you, so you may not need
to worry about these issues at all.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-684" />
<a name="INDEX-685" />
<a name="INDEX-686" />
<a name="INDEX-687" />
Another issue to consider when planning your partitions is swap space.
  You have two
options. The first is to use a <em class="emphasis">swap file</em> that
exists on one of your Linux filesystems. You will create the swap file
for use as virtual <span class="acronym">RAM</span> after you install the
software. The second option is to create a <em class="emphasis">swap
partition</em>, an individual partition to be used only as swap
space. Most people use a swap partition instead of a swap file.</p>

<p>A single swap file or partition may be up to 128 MB (more with the
latest kernels).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-15">[15]</a>
 If you
wish to use more than 128 MB of swap (hardly ever necessary), you can
create multiple swap partitions or files--up to 16 in all. For
example, if you need 256 MB of swap, you can create two 128-MB swap
partitions.</p><blockquote>

<a name="FOOTNOTE-15" /><p>[15]This value applies to machines with Intel
			processors. On other architectures like the Alpha, it can
			be higher.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Setting up a swap partition is covered in the section

"<a href="ch03_01.htm">Section 3.1.4, "Creating Swap Space"</a>" in
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Installation
 and Initial
 Configuration"</a>, and setting up a swap file in
the section "<a href="ch06_02.htm">Section 6.2, "Managing Swap Space"</a>" in
<a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Managing
 Filesystems, Swap,
 and Devices"</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, in general, you will create at least two partitions for
Linux: one for use as the root filesystem, and the other for use as
swap space.  There are, of course, many variations on partitioning, but
this is the minimal setup. You are not required to use swap space with
Linux, but if you have less than 32 MB of physical
<span class="acronym">RAM</span>, it is strongly suggested that you do.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-688" />
<a name="INDEX-689" />
<a name="INDEX-690" />
  Of course, you need to know how
much <em class="emphasis">space</em> these partitions will require. The
size of your Linux filesystems (containing the software itself)
depends greatly on how much software you're installing and what
distribution of Linux you are using. Hopefully, the documentation that
came with your distribution will give you an approximation of the
space requirements. A small Linux system can use 40 MB or less; a
larger system anywhere from 100 to 300 MB, or more. Keep in mind that
in addition to the space required by the software itself, you need to
allocate extra space for user directories, room for future expansion,
and so forth.</p>

<p>If you use several partitions, you can use a rather small partition
for the root directory. 32 MB should suffice--use at least 30-50 MB
more if you keep <em class="filename">/var</em> on the same partition, as most people do. On
the other hand, you will probably want to have a largish
<em class="filename">/usr</em> partition.</p>

<p>The size of your swap partition (should you elect to use one) depends
on how much virtual <span class="acronym">RAM</span> you require. A rule of
thumb is to use a swap partition that is twice the space of your
physical <span class="acronym">RAM</span>; for example, if you have 4 MB of
physical <span class="acronym">RAM</span>, an 8-MB swap partition should
suffice.  Of course, this is mere speculation; the actual amount
of swap space you require depends on the software you will be
running. If you have a great deal of physical <span class="acronym">RAM</span>
(say, 64 MB or more), you may not wish to use swap space at all.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-691" />
<img src="figs/bomb.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because of
<span class="acronym">BIOS</span> limitations, it is usually not possible to
boot from partitions using cylinders numbered over 1023. Therefore,
when setting aside space for Linux, keep in mind you may not want
to use a partition in the  over-1023 cylinder range for your Linux root
filesystem.  Linux can still <em class="emphasis">use</em> partitions with
cylinders numbered over 1023, but you may not be able to
<em class="emphasis">boot</em> Linux from such a partition. This advice may
seem premature, but it is important to know when planning your drive
layout, and today, many people have large disks with more than 1023
cylinders.</p>

<p>If you absolutely must use a partition with cylinders numbered over
1023 for your Linux root filesystem, you can always boot Linux from floppy.
This is not so bad, actually; it takes only a few seconds longer to boot
than from the hard drive. At any rate, it's always an option.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">2.2.4. Repartitioning Your Drives</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-696" />
<a name="INDEX-697" />
In this section,
we'll describe how to resize your current partitions (if any) to make
space for Linux. If you are installing Linux on a "clean"
hard drive, skip this section and proceed to
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Installation
 and Initial
 Configuration"</a>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-698" />
The usual way to resize an existing partition is to delete it (thus
destroying all data on that partition) and recreate it. Before
repartitioning your drives, <em class="emphasis">back up your
system</em>. After resizing the partitions, you can reinstall
your original software from the backup.  However, there are several
programs available for <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> that
resize partitions nondestructively. One of these is known as
<span class="acronym">FIPS</span> and can be found on many Linux
<span class="acronym">FTP</span> sites.</p>

<?troff .Nd 10?><p><a name="INDEX-699" />
Also, keep in mind that because you'll be shrinking your original
partitions, you may not have space to reinstall everything. In this case,
you need to delete enough unwanted software to allow the rest to fit on
the smaller partitions.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-700" />
<a name="INDEX-701" />
<a name="INDEX-702" />
 The program used to repartition is known as
<tt class="command">fdisk</tt>. Each operating system has its own analogue
of this program; for example, under <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>, it is
invoked with the <span class="acronym">FDISK</span> command. You should consult
your documentation for whatever operating systems you are currently
running for information on repartitioning. Here, we'll discuss how to
resize partitions for <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> using
<tt class="command">fdisk</tt>, but this information should be easily
extrapolated to other operating systems.</p>

<p>The <tt class="command">fdisk</tt> program (on any operating system) is
responsible for reading the partition table on a given drive and
manipulating it to add or delete partitions. However, some versions of
<tt class="command">fdisk</tt> do more than this, such as adding information
to the beginning of a new partition to make it usable by a certain
operating system. For this reason, you should usually only create
partitions for an operating system with the version of
<tt class="command">fdisk</tt> that comes with it. You can't  create
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> partitions with Linux
<tt class="command">fdisk</tt>; partitions created in this way can't
be used correctly by <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> (actually, if you
really know what you are doing, you might be lucky in creating
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> partitions from Linux, but we would not
advise doing so). Similarly,
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> <tt class="command">fdisk</tt> may not be able to
recognize Linux partitions. As long as you have a version of
<tt class="command">fdisk</tt> for each operating system you use, you should
be fine. (Note that not all systems name this program
<tt class="command">fdisk</tt>; some refer to it as a "disk
manager" or "volume manager.")</p>

<p>
Later, in the section "<a href="ch03_01.htm">Section 3.1.3, "Creating Linux Partitions"</a>" in
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Installation
 and Initial
 Configuration"</a>,
we describe how to create new Linux partitions, but for now we are
concerned with resizing your current ones.</p>

<p>
<img src="figs/bomb.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="emphasis">Please</em> consult the documentation for your
current operating systems before repartitioning your drive. This
section is meant to be a general overview of the process; there are
many subtleties we do not cover here.  You can lose all the
software on your system if you do not repartition the drive correctly.</p>

<p>Let's say that you have a single hard drive on your system, currently
devoted entirely to <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>. Hence, your drive
consists of a single <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> partition, commonly
known as <tt class="literal">C:</tt>. Because this repartitioning method
will destroy the data on that partition, you need to create a bootable
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> "system disk," which contains
everything necessary to run <span class="acronym">FDISK</span> and restore the
software from backup after the repartitioning is complete.</p>

<p>In many cases, you can use the <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> installation
disks for this purpose.  However, if you need to create your own
system disk, format a floppy with the
<?troff \p?> command:
<?troff-ps_indent0?>
<blockquote><pre class="code">FORMAT /s A:</pre></blockquote>



<?troff .Nd 10?>
Copy onto this floppy all necessary <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>
utilities (usually most of the software in the directory
<em class="emphasis">\DOS</em> on your drive), as well as the programs
<em class="emphasis">FORMAT.COM</em> and
<em class="emphasis">FDISK.EXE</em>. You should now be able to boot this
floppy and run the command:

<blockquote><pre class="code">FDISK C:</pre></blockquote>


to start up <span class="acronym">FDISK</span>.</p>

<p>Use of <span class="acronym">FDISK</span> should be self-explanatory, but
consult the <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> documentation for details. When
you start <span class="acronym">FDISK</span>, use the menu option to display the
partition table, and write down the information displayed there. It is
important to keep a record of your original setup in case you want to
back out of the Linux installation.</p>

<p>To delete an existing partition, choose the <span class="acronym">FDISK</span>
menu option "<tt class="literal">Delete an MS-DOS Partition or Logical DOS
Drive</tt>." Specify the type of partition you wish to
delete (primary, extended, or logical) and the number of the
partition. Verify all of the warnings. Poof!</p>

<p>To create a new (smaller) partition for <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>,
choose the <span class="acronym">FDISK</span> option "<tt class="literal">Create an
MS-DOS Partition or Logical DOS Drive</tt>." Specify the
type of partition (primary, extended, or logical) and the size of the
partition to create (specified in megabytes). <span class="acronym">FDISK</span>
should create the partition, and you're ready to roll.</p>

<p>After you're done using <span class="acronym">FDISK</span>, exit the program and
reformat any new partitions. For example, if you resized the first
<span class="acronym">DOS</span> partition on your drive
(<tt class="literal">C:</tt>), you should run the command:

<blockquote><pre class="code">FORMAT /s C:</pre></blockquote>

You may now reinstall your original software from backup.</p>
