<h2 class="sect1">15.3. PPP over ISDN</h2>

<p>ISDN has offered convenient, high-speed data
<a name="INDEX-3123" />
<a name="INDEX-3124" />
<a name="INDEX-3125" />
          communications--at a price--for many years; it is
          particularly popular in Europe where rates and marketing
          have been more favorable to its use than in the United States. ISDN,
          which integrates data and regular voice transmission over a
          single line, offers both a faster connection setup and much
          better throughput than traditional modems.</p>

<p>          <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> lines can transfer 64 kbits/second.
          And unlike analog lines, they can achieve this speed all the
          time, because their transmission does not depend on the
          vagaries of analog transmission with interference by various
          kinds of noise. A newer protocol called ADSL (Asymmetric
          Digital Subscriber Line) is upping the ante for fast data
          access over phone lines, but ISDN still has a bigger market
          right now.</p>

<p>In this section, we describe how to configure dial-up access to
          your Internet provider over an <span class="acronym">ISDN</span>
          line. We'll cover only the most common style of connection,
          synchronous <span class="acronym">PPP</span>, not the special mode called
          <em class="emphasis">Raw IP</em> over <span class="acronym">ISDN</span>.
          Furthermore, this section discusses just internal
          <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> boards, which require a very
          different kind of setup from the dial-up access covered in
          the previous section.  To set up external
          <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> devices, or the so-called
          <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> modems (a term that is an oxymoron, because
          there is no modulation and demodulation), you can use
          commands similar to those in the previous section,    
          because these devices present themselves to the computer and the
          operating system like a normal modem that offers some additional
          commands, faster connection setup, and higher throughput.</p>

<p>In a way, setting up <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> connections is much easier than
          setting up analog connections, because many of the problems
          (bad lines, long connection setup times, and so on) simply cannot
          occur with digital lines. Once you dial the number, the
          connection is set up within milliseconds. But this can lead to
          problems. Since the connections are set up and shut down so fast, 
          a misconfigured system that dials out again and again can cost
          you a fortune. This is even more so because with internal 
          <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> cards, you hear no clicking and whistling like with modems,
          and there are no lights that inform you that a connection has
          been made. You can check the status of your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> line with some
          simple programs, though.</p>

<p>Setting up dial-up <span class="acronym">PPP</span> over <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> is done in two
          steps:</p>

<ol><li><p>Configure your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> hardware.</p></li><li><p>Configure and start the <span class="acronym">PPP</span> daemon and change the
                  routing table to use your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> line.</p></li></ol><p>We will cover those steps in the next sections.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.3.1. Configuring Your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> Hardware</h3>

<p>The first step involves making your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> board
<a name="INDEX-3126" />
<a name="INDEX-3127" />
<a name="INDEX-3128" />
<a name="INDEX-3129" />
                accessible to the kernel. Like with any other hardware board, 
                you need a device driver that must be configured with the
                correct parameters for your board.</p>

<p>Linux supports a large number of <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> hardware
                boards. We cannot cover every single board here, but the
                procedure is more or less the same for each one. Reading the documentation
                for your specific card in the directory
                <em class="filename">Documentation/isdn</em> in the Linux kernel
                sources will help you a lot if your board is not covered
                here.</p>

<p>We will concentrate here on boards that use the so-called 
<a name="INDEX-3130" />
                <em class="emphasis">HiSax</em> driver. This device driver works
                with most cards that use the Siemens HSCX chipset. That
                includes, for instance, the USR Sportster internal TA and the well-known 
                Teles, ELSA, and Fritz boards. Other boards are similarly
                configured.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is configure the kernel 
                so that it includes <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> support.  It is very
                advisable to compile everything <span class="acronym">ISDN</span>-related as
                modules, especially while you are
                experimenting with setting it up.
                You will need the following
<?troff \p?> modules:</p>

<ul><li><p><span class="acronym">ISDN</span> support.</p></li><li><p>Support for synchronous <span class="acronym">PPP</span>.</p></li><li><p>One device driver module for your hardware. If you
                        pick the HiSax driver, you will also have to specify which 
                        specific brand of <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> card you have and which <span class="acronym">ISDN</span>
                        protocol you want to use. The latter is almost certainly
                        EURO/DSS1, unless you live in Germany
                        and have had your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> for a long time in which case
                        it might be 1TR6. When in doubt, ask
                        your phone company.</p></li></ul><p>                
		Compile and install the modules as described in <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "Upgrading Software and the Kernel"</a>. Now you are ready to
                configure your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> hardware. Some distributions 
                like SuSE make setting up <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> lines very easy and
                comfortable. We cover the hard way here in case your
                distribution is not so user friendly, the automatic
                configuration does not work, or you simply want to know what is 
                going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Now you need to load the device driver module
using <tt class="command">modprobe</tt>. This will 
                automatically load the other modules as well. All the device
                driver modules accept a number of module parameters; the
                <tt class="literal">hisax</tt> modules accepts, among others, the
<?troff \p?>
                following:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">id=</tt><em class="replaceable">boardid</em></b></dt><dd><p>Sets an identifier for the <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> board. You can
                          pick any name you like here, but you cannot have the
                          same identifier for more than one board in your
<?troff \p?>
                          system.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">type=</tt><em class="replaceable">boardtype</em></b></dt><dd><p>Specifies the exact board brand and type. For
                          example, a value of 16 for
                          <em class="replaceable">boardtype</em> selects the support 
                          for the USR Sportster internal TA. See
                          <em class="filename">Documentation/isdn/README.hisax</em> in
                          the kernel sources for the full list of board types.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">protocol=</tt><em class="replaceable">protocoltype</em></b></dt><dd><p>Selects an <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> subprotocol. Valid values for
                          <em class="replaceable">protocoltype</em> are 1 for the
                          old German <tt class="literal">1TR6</tt> protocol, 2 for the
                          common <tt class="literal">EDSS1</tt> (so-called Euro <span class="acronym">ISDN</span>)
                          and 3 for leased lines.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">irq=</tt><em class="replaceable">irqno</em></b></dt><dd><p>Specifies the interrupt line to use. Not all
                          boards need this.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">io=</tt><em class="replaceable">addr</em></b></dt><dd><p>Specifies the I/O address to use. Not all boards need this. Some
                          boards need two I/O addresses.  In this
                          case, the parameters to use are
                          <tt class="literal">io0</tt> and
                          <tt class="literal">io1</tt>.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>For example, the following command loads the HiSax
                driver for use with a Teles 16.3 board, Euro <span class="acronym">ISDN</span>, IO address
                0x280, and IRQ line 10 (a very common case):</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>modprobe hisax type=3 protocol=2 io=0x280 irq=10 </b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<?troff .Nd 10?><p>Please see
                <em class="filename">Documentation/isdn/README.HiSax</em> or the
                equivalent file for your hardware for more information.</p>

<p>This module is not much of a talker; if there is no
                output from the <tt class="command">modprobe</tt> command, it is
                likely that everything went well. You might also want to check 
                your system log at <em class="filename">/var/log/messages</em>. You
                should see a few lines starting with <tt class="literal">HiSax:</tt> 
                (or the name of the driver you are using), ending with:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">HiSax: module installed</pre></blockquote>

<p>If the module did not load, you will most likely find the
                answer also in <em class="filename">/var/log/messages</em>. The most
                common problem is that the IRQ or I/O address was wrong or that
                you selected the wrong card type. If all else fails, and you
                have Windows installed on the same machine, boot up Windows
                and check what it reports for the IRQ and I/O address
                lines.</p>

<p>You should do one more check before you jump to the next 
                section, and this check involves calling yourself. This can
                work because, with <span class="acronym">ISDN</span>, you always have two phone lines at
                your disposition. Thus one line will be used for the outgoing
                "phone call" and the other line will be used for
                the incoming one.</p>

<p>In order to have the <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> subsystem report what is going 
                on with your phone lines, you will need to configure it to be
                more verbose than it is by default. You do this by means of
                three utility programs that are all part of the
                isdn4k-utils package that you can find at
                your friendly Linux <span class="acronym">FTP</span> server around the
                corner.</p>

<p>The isdn4k-utils contain, among other
                things, the three utilities <tt class="command">hisaxctrl</tt> for
                configuring the device driver, <tt class="command">isdnctrl</tt> for 
                configuring the higher levels of the <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> subsystem, and
                <tt class="command">isdnlog</tt>, a very useful tool that logs
                everything happening on your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> lines. While you can use
                <tt class="command">hisactrl</tt> and <tt class="command">isdnctrl</tt>
                without any configuration, you will need to provide a small
                configuration file for <tt class="command">isdnlog</tt>. For now, we 
                will content ourselves with a quick solution, but once your
                <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> connection is up and running, you will want to configure
                <tt class="command">isdnlog</tt> to see where your money is going. So for now, copy one 
                of the sample configuration files contained in the
                <tt class="command">isdnlog</tt> package to
                <em class="filename">/etc/isdn/isdn.conf</em>. You will at least
                need to edit the following lines:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">COUNTRYCODE=</tt></b></dt><dd><p>Add your phone country code here, for example, 1 for the
                          United States and Canada, 44 for the United Kingdom, 46
                          for Sweden, and so on.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">AREAPREFIX=</tt></b></dt><dd><p>If the area codes in your country are prefixed by
                          a fixed digit, put this in here. The prefix is
                          0 for most European
                          countries, 9 for Finland, and nothing
                          for the United States, Denmark, and Norway.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">AREACODE=</tt></b></dt><dd><p>Put your area code in here. If you have specified
                          an <tt class="literal">AREAPREFIX</tt> in the last step, don't repeat that
                          here. For example, Stockholm, Sweden, has the area code
                          08. You put 0 into <tt class="literal">AREAPREFIX</tt> and 8 into <tt class="literal">AREACODE.</tt></p></dd>

</dl>

<p>Once you have set this up, execute the following
                commands to make your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> system more verbose:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"><tt class="computeroutput">tigger #</tt> <tt class="userinput"><b>/sbin/hisaxctrl</b></tt> <em class="replaceable">boardid</em> 1 4
<tt class="computeroutput">tigger #</tt> <tt class="userinput"><b>/sbin/isdnctrl verbose 3</b></tt>
<tt class="computeroutput">tigger #</tt> <tt class="userinput"><b>/sbin/lsdnlog /dev/isdnctrl0 &amp;</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>If you need to use a different driver from HiSax, you
                might need to use a different command. For example, for the
                PCBit driver, the command <tt class="command">pcbitctl</tt> is
                available in the isdn4k-utils
                package.</p>

<p>Now you can go ahead and phone yourself. You should try 
                all your MSNs (multiple subscriber numbers, which are your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> phone
                numbers) to see that the board can detect all of them. During
                or after each call, check
                <em class="filename">/var/log/messages</em>. You should see lines
                like the following:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Mar 16 18:34:22 tigger kernel: isdn_net: call from 4107123455,1,0 -&gt; 123456
Mar 16 18:34:33 tigger kernel: isdn_net: Service-Indicator not 7, ignored</pre></blockquote>

<p>This shows that the kernel has detected voice call (the
                service indicator is 0) from the phone number 123455 in the
                area with the area code (0)4107 to the MSN 123456.</p>

<p>Note how the number called is specified,
                because you will need this information later. The number is
                sent with the area code in some phone networks, but
                without the area code in others.
                Anyway, congratulations if you have come this far.
                Your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> hardware is now correctly configured.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">15.3.2. Setting Up Synchronous <span class="acronym">PPP</span></h3>

<p>Setting up the <span class="acronym">PPP</span> daemon again involves several
<a name="INDEX-3135" />
<a name="INDEX-3136" />
<a name="INDEX-3137" />
                substeps. On Linux, the <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> board is treated like a network
                interface that you have to configure with special
                commands. In addition, you need to specify the username and
                password that your <span class="acronym">ISP</span> has assigned
                you. When everything is configured, you start up the
<a name="INDEX-3138" />
<a name="INDEX-3139" />
                <tt class="command">ipppd</tt> daemon, which lurks in the background
                until a connection request is made.</p>

<p>First, let's configure the "network
                interface." This involves a number of commands that most 
                system administrators simply put into a script that they
                store in a file like <em class="filename">/sbin/pppon</em>. Here is 
                a sample file that you can modify to your needs:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">/sbin/isdnctrl addif ippp0
/sbin/isdnctrl addphone ippp0 out 0123456789
/sbin/isdnctrl dialmax ippp0 2
/sbin/isdnctrl eaz ippp0 123456

/sbin/isdnctrl encap ippp0 syncppp
/sbin/ifconfig ippp0 1.1.1.1 pointopoint 123.45.67.89 metric 1</pre></blockquote>

<p>Let's go through these commands one by one:</p>

                          check with your provider, because the phone number for
                          <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> access could be different.</p></dd>

                          yourself, the kernel will do that for

                          since this provides only very weak authentication
                          facilities, few providers still use it, even though it
                          gives slightly better throughput because it has less

                          connections), you need to specify your IP address
                          instead of the 1.1.1.1 here. Also, you need to change
                          the 123.45.67.89 to the IP address of your provider's
                          dial-up server.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>Phew! But we are not finished yet. Next, you need to
                configure the <tt class="command">ipppd</tt> daemon itself. This is
                done in the file <em class="filename">/etc/ppp/ioptions</em>. You
                can also have a configuration file specific to each
                <tt class="command">ipppd</tt> daemon, but that is necessary only if 
                you want to be able to use different <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> connections, that is,
                if you have multiple dial-up accounts.</p>

<p>The following is an <em class="filename">ioptions</em> file
                that is generic enough to work with most providers. It does
                not give maximum throughput but is quite stable. If you want
                to optimize it, ask your provider about the possible
                settings and read the manual page for
                <tt class="command">ipppd</tt> :</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">debug
/dev/ippp0
user yourusername
name yourusername
mru 1500
mtu 1500
ipcp-accept-local
ipcp-accept-remote
noipdefault
-vj -vjccomp -ac -pc -bsdcomp
defaultroute</pre></blockquote>

<p>You have to change only two things here: change
                <tt class="literal">yourusername</tt> in the third and
fourth lines to the username that your
                provider has assigned you for connecting to his system. We
                won't go through all the options here; see the manual page
                when in doubt.</p>

<p>ISDN access requires the same security as an
                analog modem. See the section "PAP and CHAP" earlier
                in this chapter for directions on setting up your
                <em class="filename">pap-secrets</em> or
                <em class="filename">chap-secrets</em> file as required by
                your service provider.</p>

<p>Now we have got our things together and can start having 
                fun! First run the <tt class="command">ipppd</tt> daemon:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>/sbin/ipppd pidfile /var/run/ipppd.ippp0.pid file /etc/ppp/ioptions &amp;</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="command">ipppd</tt> daemon will now wait for
                connection requests. Since we have not configured it yet to
                automatically make a connection, we have to manually trigger 
                the connection. This is done with the following
                command:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>isdnctrl dial ippp0</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>You should now check
                <em class="filename">/var/log/messages</em>. There should be lots
                of messages that start with <tt class="literal">ipppd</tt>. The last 
                of those messages should be contain the words <tt class="literal">local
                IP address</tt> and <tt class="literal">remote IP address</tt>
                together with the IP addresses. Once you find those messages, you are
                done. Because we have used the <tt class="literal">defaultroute</tt> 
                option previously, the kernel has set up the default route to use
                the <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> connection, and you should now be able to access the
                wide, wide world of the Internet. Start by pinging your
                provider's IP address. Once you are done and want to shut down 
                the connection, enter:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>isdnctrl hangup ippp0</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<a name="INDEX-3140" /><a name="INDEX-3,141" /><a name="INDEX-3,142" />
</div>




<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.3.3. And If It Does Not Work?</h3>

<p>If you have no connection even though your hardware was successfully recognized and you have 
<a name="INDEX-3143" />
<a name="INDEX-3144" />
<a name="INDEX-3145" />
<a name="INDEX-3146" />
                set up everything as described here, <em class="filename">/var/log/messages</em> is 
                again your friend. It is very likely that you will find the
                cause of the error there, even though it might be buried a
                bit.</p>

<p>The most common error is specifying the password or the
                username incorrectly. You know
                that you have a problem with the authentification if you see a 
                line like:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PAP authentification failed</pre></blockquote>

<p>or:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">CHAP authentification failed</pre></blockquote>

<p>in the log file. Check your
                <em class="filename">chap-secrects</em> or
                <em class="filename">pap-secrets</em> very carefully. Your provider 
                might also be able to see from her log files where exactly the
                authentification went wrong.</p>

<p>Of course, it could also be the case that your provider
                does not support synchronous <span class="acronym">PPP</span> as described here, even
                though most providers do nowadays. If this is the case, ask
                your provider for exact settings.</p>

<p>If it still does not work, ask your provider. A good ISP 
                has a phone support line and can help you
                connect your Linux box. If your provider tells you that they
                "only support Windows," then it's time to
                switch. There are many Linux-friendly providers out there.
                Often the support staff is using Linux and can
                help you even though the provider's official policy is not to
                support Linux.</p>

<p>If for some reason you are stuck with an uncooperative provider, try
                finding other customers of this provider that also use
                Linux. Setting up your connection in nonstandard cases means
                fiddling with the options and parameters of the <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> subsystem 
                in the kernel and the <tt class="command">ipppd</tt> daemon, and if
                somebody else has already found out what to do, you don't have 
                to.</p>

</div>




<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.3.4. Where to Go from Here?</h3>

<p>Once your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> connection works and you can access the
                Internet, you might want to set up some conveniences
or other customizations. Here are some 
                suggestions:</p>

<ul><li><p>Make <tt class="command">ipppd</tt> dial your remote site
                        automatically. This can be done by setting the default
                        route to the <tt class="command">ippp0</tt> device like
                        this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">/sbin/route add default netmask 0.0.0.0 ippp0</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now, whenever the kernel needs to send an IP packet
                        to an IP address for which it has no specific route
                        configured, it will trigger the <tt class="command">ipppd</tt>
                        daemon to build a connection. </p>
<p><img src="figs/bomb.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;

Use this only if
                        you have also specified the <tt class="literal">huptimeout</tt>

                        option of the <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> subsystem, otherwise you could pay a
                        fortune to your telephone company (unless you have a flat
                        rate).</p>

<p>Since there are programs that try to build up
                        Internet connections from time to time (Netscape is one of 
                        those candidates), setting this up can be dangerous for
                        your wallet. If you use this, make sure to check the state 
                        of the connection often (see later in this section).</p></li><li><p>Try tools that monitor your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> connection. The
                        <em class="emphasis">isdn4k-utils</em> package contains a number
                        of those tools, including the command-line tools
                        <tt class="command">imon</tt> and <tt class="command">imontty</tt> and 
                        X-based tools.</p></li><li><p>Configure <tt class="command">isdnlog</tt> to log exactly
                        what you need, and use <tt class="command">isdnrep</tt> to get
                        detailed reports about the usage of your <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> line. This
                        works not only for calls to and from computer
systems but for calls to other <span class="acronym">ISDN</span>-enabled devices like
                        phones and fax machines. There is only one caveat: Your
                        <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> board cannot capture outgoing phone numbers for
                        connections being set up by other devices. Most telephone companies
                        provide a service, though, that echos this phone number
                        back to you and thus lets the <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> subsystem pick it
                        up. This service is often available for free or for a
                        nominal fee. Ask your telephone company.</p></li><li><p>For the truly adventurous: Experiment with
                        Multilink-<span class="acronym">PPP</span>. As you know, with <span class="acronym">ISDN</span> you have at least
                        two lines. If you need extra high capacity, why not use
                        both? That's what Multilink-<span class="acronym">PPP</span> does. In order to use
                        this, you need to turn on the <tt class="literal">Support generic
                        MP</tt> option during kernel configuration and see
                        the files
                        <em class="filename">Documentation/isdn/README.syncppp</em> and 
                        <em class="filename">Documentation/isdn/syncppp.FAQ</em> in the 
                        kernel sources for hints on how to do this. Of course, your
                        provider has to support this, too.</p></li></ul>
