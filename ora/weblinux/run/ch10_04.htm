<h2 class="sect1">10.4. Configuring XFree86</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-2213" />
<a name="INDEX-2214" />
<a name="INDEX-2215" />
Setting up XFree86 is not difficult in most cases. However, if you happen to 
be using hardware for which drivers are under development, or wish
to obtain the best performance or resolution from an accelerated
graphics card, configuring XFree86 can be somewhat time-consuming.</p>

<p>In this section, we describe how to create and edit the
<em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file, which configures the XFree86
server. In many cases, it is best to start out with a
"basic" XFree86 configuration--one that uses a low
resolution.  A good choice is 640x480, which should be supported on
all video cards and monitor types. Once you have XFree86 working at a
lower, standard resolution, you can tweak the configuration to exploit
the capabilities of your video hardware. The idea is that you want to
make sure XFree86 works at least minimally on your system and that something
isn't wrong with your installation before attempting the sometimes
difficult task of setting up XFree86 for real use. With current
hardware, you should easily be able to get up to 1024x768 pixels.</p>

<p>But before you start to write a
	  <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file yourself, try one of the
	  configuration programs that are available. In many cases, you
	  can avoid going through the hassle that will be described on the 
	  next pages. Some programs that may help you are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="command">XF86Setup</tt></b></dt><dd><p>This graphical configuration program is provided by
<a name="INDEX-2216" />
			the XFree86 team themselves. It starts up a VGA X server
			with 16 colors (which is quite sure to run on just about any
			display hardware) and then lets you select your graphics
			board, your monitor type, your mouse type, and other
			options. At the end, it tries to start up a server as
			configured, and if you are satisfied, it offers to write
			the configuration file for you. We have found this program
			to be very useful and reliable in many cases.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="command">ConfigXF86</tt></b></dt><dd><p>This is a text-based program that asks you a number
<a name="INDEX-2217" />
			of questions and then generates a configuration file from
			your answers. It is by no means as comfortable to use as
			<tt class="command">XF86Setup</tt> (and is slightly outdated),
			but it has been reported to work in cases where
			<tt class="command">XF86Setup</tt> has failed.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">Distribution-specific configuration tools</em></b></dt><dd><p>Some distributions also have their own configuration 
			tools. For example, SuSE has <tt class="command">SaX</tt> and
			Red Hat has <tt class="command">Xconfigurator</tt>. Caldera
			OpenLinux now even configures the mouse and the video
			board automatically during installation.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>If one of these tools is able to configure your X server
	  for you, you should use it and save yourself a lot of
	  trouble. However, if all of the tools fail or if you really want 
	  to fine-tune your X server, you will have to know how to edit
	  the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file yourself.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2218" />
In addition to the information here, you should read the following
documentation:</p>

<ul><li><p> The XFree86 documentation in <em class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</em> (contained
within the <em class="filename">Xdoc</em> package). You should especially see the
file <em class="filename">README.Config</em>, which is an XFree86 configuration tutorial.</p></li><li><p> The <em class="filename">README</em> file for your video chipset, if one exists,
 in the directory
<em class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</em>.  These <em class="filename">README</em> files have names such as
<em class="filename">README.Cirrus</em> and <em class="filename">README.S3</em>.</p></li><li><p> The manual page for <em class="filename">XFree86</em>.</p></li><li><p> The manual page for <em class="filename">XF86Config</em>.</p></li><li><p> The manual page for the particular server that you are using (such as 
<em class="filename">XF86_SVGA</em> or <em class="filename">XF86_S3</em>).</p></li></ul><p />

<p>The main configuration file you need to create is
<em class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</em> (some distributions 
put this in <em class="filename">/etc/XF86Config</em> or
<em class="filename">/etc/X11</em> instead).  This file
contains information on your mouse, video card parameters, and so
on. The file <em class="filename">XF86Config.eg</em> is provided with the
XFree86 distribution as an example. Copy this file to
<em class="filename">XF86Config</em> and edit it as a starting point.</p>

<p>The <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> manual page explains the format of
this file in detail.  Read this manual page now if you have not done
so already.</p>

<p>We are going to present a sample <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file,
piece by piece.  This file may not look exactly like the sample file
included in the XFree86 distribution, but the structure is the same.</p>

<p>The <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file format may change with each
version of XFree86; this information is only valid for XFree86 Version
3.3.3.1.</p>

<p>
<img src="figs/bomb.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, you should not simply copy the configuration file listed
here to your own system and attempt to use it. Attempting to use a
configuration file that doesn't correspond to your hardware could
drive the monitor at a frequency that is too high for it; there have
been reports of monitors (especially fixed-frequency monitors) being
damaged or destroyed by using an incorrectly configured
<em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file. The bottom line is this: make
absolutely sure your <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file
corresponds to your hardware before you attempt to use it.</p>

<p>Each section of the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file is surrounded
by the pair of lines <tt class="literal">Section
"</tt><em class="replaceable">section-name</em><tt class="literal">"</tt>&#133;<tt class="literal">EndSection</tt>. The first part of the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file is
<tt class="literal">Files</tt>, which looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Section "Files"
    RgbPath     "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb"
    FontPath    "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
    FontPath    "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
EndSection</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">RgbPath</tt> line sets the path to the X11R6
<span class="acronym">RGB</span>
color database, and each <tt class="literal">FontPath</tt> line sets the
path to a directory containing X11 fonts. In general, you shouldn't
have to modify these lines; just be sure there is a
<tt class="literal">FontPath</tt> entry for each font type you have
installed (i.e., for each directory in
<em class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts</em>). If you add the string
<tt class="literal">:unscaled</tt> to a <tt class="literal">FontPath</tt>, the
fonts from this directory will not be scaled. This is often an
improvement because fonts that are vastly scaled look ugly. In addition to
<tt class="literal">FontPath</tt> and <tt class="literal">RgbPath</tt>, you can
also add a <tt class="literal">ModulePath</tt> to this section, to point
to a directory with dynamically loaded modules. Those modules are
currently used for some special input devices, as well as the PEX and
XIE extensions.</p>

<p>The next section is <tt class="literal">ServerFlags</tt>, which specifies
several global flags for the server. In general this section is empty:

<blockquote><pre class="code">Section "ServerFlags"
# Uncomment this to cause a core dump at the spot where a signal is 
# received.  This may leave the console in an unusable state, but may
# provide a better stack trace in the core dump to aid in debugging
#    NoTrapSignals
# Uncomment this to disable the &lt;Crtl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;BS&gt; server abort sequence
#    DontZap
EndSection</pre></blockquote>


Here, we have all lines within the section commented out.</p>

<p>The next section is <tt class="literal">Keyboard</tt>:

<blockquote><pre class="code">Section "Keyboard"
    Protocol    "Standard"
    AutoRepeat  500 5
    ServerNumLock
EndSection</pre></blockquote>


Other options are available as well: see the
<em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file if you wish to modify the
keyboard configuration. The previous example  should work for most systems with U.S. 
keyboards. If you have another keyboard, you will have to add
additional lines. For example, the following works for a
standard German keyboard:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">XkbRules	"xfree86"
XkbModel	"pc102"
XkbLayout	"de"
XkbVariants	""
XkbOptions	""</pre></blockquote>

<p>The next section is <tt class="literal">Pointer</tt>, which specifies
parameters for the mouse device:

<blockquote><pre class="code">Section "Pointer"

    Protocol    "MouseSystems"
    Device      "/dev/mouse"

<?troff .ne 10?>
# Baudrate and SampleRate are only for some Logitech mice
#    BaudRate   9600
#    SampleRate 150

# Emulate3Buttons is an option for 2-button Microsoft mice
#    Emulate3Buttons

# ChordMiddle is an option for some 3-button Logitech mice
#    ChordMiddle

EndSection</pre></blockquote>


The only options you should concern yourself with now are
<tt class="literal">Protocol</tt> and
<tt class="literal">Device</tt>. <tt class="literal">Protocol</tt> specifies the
mouse <em class="emphasis">protocol</em> your mouse uses (not the make
or brand of mouse). Valid types for <tt class="literal">Protocol</tt> (under
Linux--there are other options available for other operating
systems) are:</p>

<ul><li><p> <tt class="literal">BusMouse</tt></p></li><li><p> <tt class="literal">Logitech</tt></p></li><li><p> <tt class="literal">Microsoft</tt></p></li><li><p> <tt class="literal">MMSeries</tt></p></li><li><p> <tt class="literal">Mouseman</tt></p></li><li><p> <tt class="literal">MouseManPlusPS/2</tt></p></li><li><p> <tt class="literal">MouseSystems</tt></p></li><li><p> <tt class="literal">PS/2</tt></p></li><li><p> <tt class="literal">MMHitTab</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">GlidePoint</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">GlidePointPS/2</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">IntelliMouse</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">IMPS/2</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">NetMousePS/2</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">NetScrollPS/2</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">SysMouse</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">ThinkingMouse</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">ThinkingMousePS/2</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Xqueue</tt></p></li></ul><p>
<a name="INDEX-2219" />
<tt class="literal">BusMouse</tt> should be used for the Logitech busmouse. Note that
older Logitech mice that are not bus mice should use
<tt class="literal">Logitech</tt>, but newer Logitech 
mice that are not bus mice use either the <tt class="literal">Microsoft</tt> or
the <tt class="literal">Mouseman</tt> protocol. 
This is a case where the protocol doesn't necessarily have anything
to do with the make of the mouse.</p>

<p>If you have a modern serial mouse, you could also
	  try to specify <tt class="literal">Auto</tt>, which will try to
	  autoselect a mouse driver.</p>

<p>It is easy to check whether you have selected the correct
	  mouse driver once you have started up X; when you move your
	  mouse, the mouse pointer on the screen should follow this
	  movement. If it does this, your setup is very likely to be
	  correct. If it doesn't, try another driver, and also check
	  whether the device you specified is correct.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2220" />
<a name="INDEX-2221" />
<tt class="literal">Device</tt> specifies the device file where the mouse can be
accessed. On most Linux systems, this is <em class="filename">/dev/mouse</em>.
<em class="filename">/dev/mouse</em> is usually a link to the appropriate
serial port (such as <em class="filename">/dev/ttyS0</em>) for serial mice or to the
appropriate busmouse device for busmice. At any rate, be sure
that the device file listed in <tt class="literal">Device</tt> exists.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2222" />
The next section is <tt class="literal">Monitor</tt>, which specifies the characteristics
of your monitor. As with other sections in the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em>
file, there may be more than one <tt class="literal">Monitor</tt> section. This is useful
if you have multiple monitors connected to a system, or use the same
<em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file under multiple hardware configurations. 
In general though, you will need only a single <tt class="literal">Monitor</tt> section:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Section "Monitor"

    Identifier  "CTX 5468 NI"

    # These values are for a CTX 5468NI only! Don't attempt to use 
    # them with your monitor (unless you have this model)

    HorizSync    30-38,47-50
    VertRefresh  50-90

    # Modes: Name      dotclock  horiz                vert 

    ModeLine "640x480"  25       640 664 760 800      480 491 493 525
    ModeLine "800x600"  36       800 824 896 1024     600 601 603 625
    ModeLine "1024x768" 65       1024 1088 1200 1328  768 783 789 818

EndSection</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">Identifier</tt> line is used to give an arbitrary name to the
<tt class="literal">Monitor</tt> entry. This can be any string; you will use it to refer to 
the <tt class="literal">Monitor</tt> entry later in the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">HorizSync</tt> specifies the valid horizontal sync frequencies for
your monitor in kHz. If you have a multisync monitor, this can be
a range of values (or several comma-separated ranges), as seen in the <tt class="literal">Monitor</tt> section. 
If you have a fixed-frequency monitor, this will be a list of discrete 
values, such as: 
<blockquote><pre class="code">    HorizSync    31.5, 35.2, 37.9, 35.5, 48.95</pre></blockquote>

Your monitor
manual should list these values in the technical specifications 
section. If you do not have this information, you
should contact either the manufacturer or the vendor of your monitor
to obtain it. There are other sources of information, as well;
they are listed later.</p>

<p>You should be careful with those settings. While the
	  settings <tt class="literal">VertRefresh</tt> and
	  <tt class="literal">HorizSync</tt> (described next) help to make sure
	  that your monitor will not be destroyed by wrong settings, you
	  won't be very happy with your X setup if you get these values
	  wrong. Unsteady pictures, flickering, or just plain snow can
	  result.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2223" />
<a name="INDEX-2224" />
<tt class="literal">VertRefresh</tt> specifies the valid vertical refresh rates (or 
vertical synchronization frequencies) for your monitor in Hz. 
Like <tt class="literal">HorizSync</tt>, this can be a range or a list of discrete
values; your monitor manual should list them.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">HorizSync</tt> and <tt class="literal">VertRefresh</tt> are used only
to double-check that the monitor resolutions you specify are in
valid ranges. This reduces the chance that you will damage your
monitor by attempting to drive it at a frequency for which it wasn't
designed.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> directive is used to specify a single resolution mode
for your monitor. The format of <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> is:
<blockquote><pre class="code">ModeLine <em class="replaceable">name</em> <em class="replaceable">dot-clock</em> <em class="replaceable">horiz-values</em> <em class="replaceable">vert-values</em></pre></blockquote>

<em class="replaceable">name</em> is an arbitrary string, which you will use to refer to the
resolution mode later in the file. <em class="replaceable">dot-clock</em> is the driving
clock frequency or <em class="emphasis">dot clock</em> associated with the resolution mode.
A dot clock is usually specified in MHz and is the rate at which the 
video card must send pixels to the monitor at this resolution. 
<em class="replaceable">horiz-values</em> and <em class="replaceable">vert-values</em> are four numbers each;
they specify when the electron gun of the monitor should fire and
when the horizontal and vertical sync pulses fire during a sweep across the screen.</p>

<p>How can you determine the <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> values for your monitor?
The file <em class="filename">VideoModes.doc</em>, included with the XFree86 distribution,
describes in detail how to determine these values for each resolution
mode your monitor supports. First of all, <em class="replaceable">clock</em> must
correspond to one of the dot-clock values that your video card can
produce. Later in the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file, you will specify these
clocks; you can use only video modes that have a <em class="replaceable">clock</em> value
supported by your video card.</p>

<p>Two files included in the XFree86 distribution may include
<tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> data for your monitor. These files are
<em class="filename">modeDB.txt</em> and <em class="filename">Monitors</em>, both of which are found in
<em class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</em>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2225" />
You should start with <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> values for the
<span class="acronym">VESA</span> standard monitor
timings, which most monitors support. <em class="filename">modeDB.txt</em> includes timing
values for <span class="acronym">VESA</span> standard resolutions. In that file,
you will see entries such as:
<blockquote><pre class="code"># 640x480@60Hz Non-Interlaced mode
# Horizontal Sync = 31.5kHz
# Timing: H=(0.95us, 3.81us, 1.59us), V=(0.35ms, 0.064ms, 1.02ms)
#
# name        clock   horizontal timing     vertical timing      flags
 "640x480"     25.175  640  664  760  800    480  491  493  525</pre></blockquote>

This is a VESA standard timing for a 640x480 video mode. It uses a 
dot clock of 25.175, which your video card must support to use this
mode (more on this later).</p>

<p>To include this entry in the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em>
file, you'd use the line:
<blockquote><pre class="code">ModeLine "640x480" 25.175  640 664 760 800  480 491 493 525</pre></blockquote></p>

<p>Note that
the <em class="replaceable">name</em> argument to <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> (in this
case <tt class="literal">"640x480"</tt>) is an arbitrary string; the convention
is to name the mode after the resolution, but <em class="replaceable">name</em> can
technically be anything descriptive that describes the mode to you.</p>

<p>For each <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> used, the server checks that the specifications
for the mode fall within the range of values specified with
<tt class="literal">HorizSync</tt> and <tt class="literal">VertRefresh</tt>. If they do not,
the server will complain when you attempt to start up X (more on this
later).</p>

<?troff .hw mode-DB.txt?><p>If the VESA standard timings do not work for you (you'll know after 
trying to use them later when the screen is unsteady, flickers, or
shows snow), the files <em class="filename">modeDB.txt</em> and
<em class="filename">Monitors</em> include specific mode values for many monitor types. 
You can create <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> entries from the values found in those
two files as well. Be sure to use values only for your specific
model. Note that many 14- and 15-inch monitors cannot
support higher-resolution modes and often can support
resolutions of 1024x768 at low dot clocks only or not at all. This means
that if you can't find high-resolution modes for your monitor in these
files, your monitor probably does not support those resolution modes.</p>

<?troff .hw modeDB.txt?><p>If you are completely at a loss, and can't find working <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt>
values for your monitor, you can follow the instructions in the
<em class="filename">VideoModes.doc</em> file included in the XFree86 distribution to 
generate <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> values from the specifications listed in your
monitor's manual. While your mileage will certainly vary when attempting 
to generate <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> values by hand, this is a good place to look
if you can't find the values you need. <em class="filename">VideoModes.doc</em> also
describes the format of the <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> directive and other
aspects of the XFree86 server in gory detail.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you do obtain <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> values that are almost, but not
quite, right, it may be possible to simply modify the values slightly
to obtain the desired result. For example, if while running XFree86 the 
image on the monitor shifts slightly or seems to "roll," you can
follow the instructions in the <em class="filename">VideoModes.doc</em> file to try to fix
these values. Also, be sure to check the knobs and controls on the monitor
itself! In many cases it is necessary to change the horizontal or vertical
size of the display after starting up XFree86 in order for the image to
be centered and of the appropriate size. Having these controls on the 
front of the monitor can certainly make life easier. Another option
<a name="INDEX-2226" />
is to use the program <tt class="command">xvidtune</tt> (see the manual page 
for how to use it) that can help you to get all the numbers for the <tt class="literal">modeline</tt>, lets you try your changes, and even allows you to undo them
if you did something wrong.</p>

<p>
<img src="figs/bomb.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;You shouldn't use monitor timing values or <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt>
values for monitors other than the model you own. If you attempt to
drive the monitor at a frequency for which it was not designed, you can
damage or even destroy it.</p>

<p>The next section of the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file is <tt class="literal">Device</tt>,
which specifies parameters for your video card. Here is an example:
<blockquote><pre class="code">Section "Device" 
        Identifier "#9 GXE 64"

        # Nothing yet; we fill in these values later.

EndSection</pre></blockquote></p>

<p>This section defines properties for a particular video card.
<tt class="literal">Identifier</tt> is an arbitrary string describing the
card; you will use this string to refer to the card later.</p>

<p>Initially, you don't need to include anything in the
<tt class="literal">Device</tt> section, except for
<tt class="literal">Identifier</tt>. This is because we will be using the X
server itself to probe for the properties of the video card and
entering them into the <tt class="literal">Device</tt> section later.  The
XFree86 server is capable of probing for the video-card chipset, clocks,
<span class="acronym">RAMDAC</span> (one of the chips on the video board), and
amount of video <span class="acronym">RAM</span> on the board.</p>

<p>Before we do this, however, we need to finish writing the
<em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file. The next section is
<tt class="literal">Screen</tt>, which specifies the monitor/video card
combination to use for a particular server:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"> Section "Screen"
     Driver     "Accel"
     Device     "#9 GXE 64"
     Monitor    "CTX 5468 NI"
     Subsection "Display"
         Depth      16
         Modes      "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
         ViewPort   0 0
         Virtual    1024 768
     EndSubsection
 EndSection</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">Driver</tt> line specifies the X server you will be using.
The possible values for <tt class="literal">Driver</tt> are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">Accel</tt></b></dt><dd><p>For the <em class="filename">XF86_S3</em>,

<dt><b><tt class="literal">VGA16</tt></b></dt><dd><p>For the <em class="filename">XF86_VGA16</em> server</p></dd>

<p>Be sure that <em class="filename">/usr/X11R6/bin/X</em> is a symbolic link
to your server; you might have to create this link yourself if you install
XFree86 for the first time. Make a link with a command like the following:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ln -s /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_SVGA /usr/X11R6/bin/X</pre></blockquote>

<p>Of course, you have to replace the first pathname
	  with that of another server binary if you don't use the SVGA server.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">Device</tt> line specifies the <tt class="literal">Identifier</tt> from the <tt class="literal">Device</tt> 
section.
Earlier, we created a <tt class="literal">Device</tt> section with the line:
<blockquote><pre class="code">Identifier "#9 GXE 64"</pre></blockquote>

Therefore, we use <tt class="literal">"#9 GXE 64"</tt> on the <tt class="literal">Device</tt> line here.</p>

<p>Similarly, the <tt class="literal">Monitor</tt> line specifies the name of the <tt class="literal">Monitor</tt>
section to be used with this server. Here, <tt class="literal">"CTX 5468 NI"</tt> is
the <tt class="literal">Identifier</tt> used in the <tt class="literal">Monitor</tt> section described earlier.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">Subsection "Display"</tt> defines several properties of the 
XFree86 server corresponding to your monitor/video-card combination.
The <em class="filename">XF86Config</em> file describes all these options in detail;
most of them are icing on the cake and are not necessary to get the system
working.</p>

<p>The options you should know about are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">DefaultColorDepth</tt></b></dt><dd><a name="INDEX-2227" /><a name="INDEX-2228" /><p>Specifies the color depth to use in case the X
			  server supports several color depths.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">Depth</tt></b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-2229" />
Defines the number of color planes--the number of
bits per pixel. Usually, <tt class="literal">Depth</tt> is set to 8. For the VGA16
server, you would use a depth of 4, and for the monochrome server a depth
of 1. If you are using an accelerated video card or one of the better
SVGA cards with enough memory to support more bits per pixel, you can
set <tt class="literal">Depth</tt> to 16, 24, or 32.
If you have problems with depths higher than 8, set it back to 8 and 
attempt to debug the problem later.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">Modes</tt></b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-2230" />
Lists of video mode names that have 
been defined using the <tt class="literal">ModeLine</tt> directive in the <tt class="literal">Monitor</tt>
section. In the previous section, we used <tt class="literal">ModeLines</tt> named
<tt class="literal">"1024x768"</tt>, <tt class="literal">"800x600"</tt>, and <tt class="literal">"640x480"</tt>,
so we use a <tt class="literal">Modes</tt> line of:
<blockquote><pre class="code">        Modes    "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"</pre></blockquote>


The first mode listed on this line will be the default when XFree86
starts up. After XFree86 is running, you can switch between the modes
listed here using Ctrl-Alt with the plus or minus on the numeric keypad.</p>

<p>It might be best, when initially configuring XFree86, to use lower
resolution video modes, such as 640x480, which tend to work on most
systems. Once you have the basic configuration working, you can modify
<em class="filename">XF86Config</em> to support higher resolutions.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">Virtual</tt></b></dt><dd><p>Sets the
<a name="INDEX-2231" />
virtual desktop size. XFree86 has the ability to use any additional
memory on your video card to extend the size of your desktop. When you
move the mouse pointer to the edge of the display, the desktop
scrolls, bringing the additional space into view. Therefore, even if
you are running at a lower video resolution, such as 800x600, you can
set <tt class="literal">Virtual</tt> to the total resolution your video
card can support. A 1 MB video card can support 1024x768 at a depth of
8 bits per pixel, while a 2 MB card can support 1280x1024 at depth 8, or 1024x768 at
depth 16.  Of course, the entire area will not be visible at once, but
it can still be used.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">Virtual</tt>
option is a nice way to utilize the memory of your video card, but it
is rather limited. If you want to use a true virtual desktop, we
suggest using a window manager like <tt class="command">kwm</tt> or
<tt class="command">fvwm2</tt> instead. Both
allow you to have rather large virtual desktops (implemented by such
software techniques as
hiding windows instead of actually storing the entire
desktop in video memory at once). See the next chapter for more
details about this; most Linux 
systems use <tt class="command">kwm</tt>, which is a part of the K Development
Environment, by default.</p></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="literal">ViewPort</tt></b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-2232" />
If you are using the <tt class="literal">Virtual</tt> option described
earlier, <tt class="literal">ViewPort</tt> sets the coordinates of the upper-left corner 
of the virtual desktop when XFree86 starts up. <tt class="literal">ViewPort 0 0</tt> is often
used, putting the screen at the top left corner of the desktop; if
this is unspecified, the desktop is centered on the virtual
desktop display (which may be undesirable to you).</p></dd>

</dl>

<p />

<p>Many other options for this section exist; see the <em class="filename">XF86Config</em>
manual page for a complete description. In practice, these other options
are not necessary to get XFree86 working initially.</p>
