<h2 class="sect1">0.5. Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>This book is the result of many people's efforts, and as expected, it
would be impossible to list them all here. First of all, we would like
to thank Andy Oram, who did an excellent job of editing, writing, and
whip-cracking to get this book into shape. Apart from being the
overall editor, Andy contributed the Unix tutorial
chapter as well as material for the X and Perl sections.  It was Andy who
approached us about writing for O'Reilly in the first
place, and he has demonstrated the patience of a saint when waiting
for our updates to trickle in.</p>

<p>Those of you who are already familiar with Linux may notice that some
portions of this book, such as the introductory and installation
chapters, have been released as part of <em class="emphasis">Linux Installation
and Getting Started</em>, a free book available via the
Internet. O'Reilly allowed us to release those portions (originally
written for this book) to the I&amp;GS, so they could benefit the
Internet-based Linux community and we would get feedback and
corrections from its readership. Thanks to everyone who contributed
edits to those sections.</p>

<p>We would also like to thank the following people for their work on the
Linux operating system--without all of them, there wouldn't be
anything to write a book about: Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman,
Donald Becker, Alan Cox, Remy Card, Eric Raymond, Ted T'so, H.J. Lu,
Miguel de Icaza, Ross Biro, Drew Eckhardt, Ed Carp, Eric Youngdale,
Fred van Kempen, Steven Tweedie, Patrick Volkerding, Dirk Hohndel,
Matthias Ettrichand, and all of the other hackers, from the kernel grunts
to the lowly docos, too numerous to mention here.</p>

<p>Special thanks to the following people for their contributions to the
Linux Documentation Project, technical review of this book, or general
friendliness and support: Phil Hughes, Melinda McBride, Bill Hahn, Dan
Irving, Michael Johnston, Joel Goldberger, Michael K. Johnson, Adam Richter,
Roman Yanovsky, Jon Magid, Erik Troan, Lars Wirzenius, Olaf Kirch,
Greg Hankins, Alan Sondheim, Jon David, Anna Clark, Adam Goodman,
Lee Gomes, Rob Walker, Rob Malda, Jeff Bates, and Volker Lendecke.
We are grateful to Shawn Wallace and Umberto Crenca for the gorgeous
shot in <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Editors, Text Tools,
 Graphics,
 and Printing"</a> of The Gimp in use.</p>

<p>For the third edition, we thank Phil Hughes, Robert J. Chassell, Tony
Cappellini, Craig Small, Nat Makarevitch, Chris Davis, Chuck Toporek,
Frederic HongFeng, and David Pranata for wide-ranging comments and
corrections.  Particularly impressive were the efforts put in by an
entire team of Debian developers and users, organized for us by Ossama
Othman and Julian T. J. Midgley. Julian set up a CVS repository for
comments and the book was examined collectively by him, Chris
Lawrence, Robert J. Chassell, Kirk Hilliard, and Stephen Zander.</p>

<p>As you can see from a glance at the first pages of the appendices, we
had a lot of contributions from porters and developers to document
Linux support and installation on non-Intel systems.  Barrett G. Lyon
and Richard Payne (Alpha), Jason Haas (LinuxPPC), Chris Lawrence
(Linux/m68k), and David S. Miller (SPARC) all gave up a lot of their
personal time to create the appendices.  Kostas Gewrgiou, Jambi
<?troff \p?>
Ganbar, Sanjeev Gupta, Roman Hodek, Geert Uytterhoeven, Jes Sorensen, Hubert
Figuiere, and Christopher F. Miller reviewed the appendices for
various systems and offered corrections.</p>
