<h2 class="sect1">5.5. Shutting Down the System</h2>

Fortunately, shutting down the Linux system is much simpler than
booting and startup. However, it's not just a matter of hitting the
reset switch. Linux, like all Unix systems, buffers disk reads and
writes in memory. This means disk writes are delayed until
absolutely necessary, and multiple reads on the same disk block are
served directly from <span class="acronym">RAM</span>. This greatly increases performance as
disks are extremely slow relative to the <span class="acronym">CPU</span>.</p>

<p>
The problem is that if the system were to be suddenly powered down or
rebooted, the buffers in memory would not be written to disk, and
data could be lost or corrupted.

<em class="filename">/sbin/update</em> is a program
started from <em class="filename">/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</em> on most
systems; it flushes dirty buffers (ones that have been changed since
they were read from the disk) back to disk every five seconds to
prevent serious damage
from occurring should the system crash. However, to be completely safe,
the system needs to undergo a "safe" shutdown before rebooting.
This will not only ensure that disk buffers are properly synchronized, but
also allow all running processes to exit cleanly.</p>

<p><tt class="command">shutdown</tt> is the general, all-purpose command used to halt or
reboot the system. As root, you can issue the command:
<blockquote><pre class="code">/sbin/shutdown -r +10</pre></blockquote>


to cause the system to reboot in ten minutes.

The <span class="option">-r</span> switch indicates the system should be
rebooted after shutdown, and <tt class="literal">+10</tt> is the amount of time to wait
(in minutes) until shutting down. The system will print a warning message
to all active terminals, counting down until the shutdown time.
You can add your own warning message by including it on the command
line, as in:
<blockquote><pre class="code">/sbin/shutdown -r +10 "Rebooting to try new kernel"</pre></blockquote></p>

<p>You can also specify an absolute time to shutdown, as in:
<blockquote><pre class="code">/sbin/shutdown -r 13:00</pre></blockquote>

to reboot at 1:00 pm. Likewise, you can say:
<blockquote><pre class="code">/sbin/shutdown -r now</pre></blockquote>

to reboot immediately (after the safe shutdown process).</p>

<p>Using the <span class="option">-h</span> switch, instead of <span class="option">-r</span>, will cause the system to
simply be halted after shutdown; you can then turn off the system power
without fear of losing data. If you specify neither
<span class="option">-h</span> nor <span class="option">-r</span>, the system
will go into single-user mode.</p>

As we saw in the section "<a href="ch05_03.htm">Section 5.3.2, "init, inittab, and rc files"</a>," you can have
<tt class="command">init</tt> catch the Ctrl-Alt-Del key sequence and
execute a <tt class="command">shutdown</tt> command in response to it. If
you're used to rebooting your system in this way it might be good idea
to check that your <em class="filename">/etc/inittab</em> contains a
<tt class="literal">ctrlaltdel</tt> entry. Note that you should never reboot
your Linux system by pressing the system power switch or the reboot
switch on the front panel of your machine. Unless the system is
flat-out hung (a rare occurrence), you should always use
<tt class="command">shutdown</tt>. The great thing about a multiprocessing
system is that one program may hang, but you can almost always switch
to another window or virtual console to recover.</p>

<p>
<tt class="command">shutdown</tt> provides a number of other options. The
<span class="option">-c</span> switch will cancel a currently running
<tt class="command">shutdown</tt>. (Of course, you can kill the process by
hand using <tt class="command">kill</tt>, but <tt class="command">shutdown
-c</tt> might be easier.) The <span class="option">-k</span>
switch will print the warning messages but not  actually shut down the system. See
the manual page for <tt class="command">shutdown</tt> if you're interested
in the gory details.</p>
