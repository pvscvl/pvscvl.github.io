<h2 class="sect1">1.8. Differences Between Linux
 and Other Operating Systems</h2>

It's important to understand the differences between Linux and other
operating systems, such as Windows 95/98, Windows NT, OS/2, and other
implementations of Unix for the personal
computer. First of all, it should be made clear that Linux will
coexist happily with other operating systems on the same
machine: that is, you can run Windows NT and OS/2
along with Linux on the same system without problems.  There are even
ways to interact between the various operating systems, as you'll see.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.8.1. Why Use Linux?</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-560" />
Why use Linux instead of a commercial operating system? We could
give you a thousand reasons. One of the most important, however, is
that Linux is an excellent choice for personal Unix
computing. If you're a Unix software developer, why
use Windows at home? Linux will allow you to develop
and test Unix software on your PC, including
database and X applications.  If you're a student, chances are that
your university computing system runs Unix. With
Linux, you can run your own Unix system and tailor
it to your own needs. Installing and running Linux is also an
excellent way to learn Unix if you don't have
access to other Unix machines.</p>

<p>But let's not lose perspective. Linux isn't just for personal
Unix users. It's robust and complete enough to
handle large tasks, as well as distributed computing needs. Many
businesses are moving to Linux in
lieu of other Unix-based workstation environments.
Linux has an excellent price-performance ratio, is one of the most
stable and powerful operating systems available, and because of its
Open Source nature, is completely customizable for your needs.
Universities are finding Linux to be perfect for teaching courses in
operating systems design. Larger commercial software vendors are
starting to realize the opportunities a free operating system can
provide.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.8.2. Linux Versus Windows 95 and 98</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-561" />
<a name="INDEX-562" />
It's not uncommon to run both Linux
and Windows 95/98 on the same system.  Many Linux users
rely on Windows for applications such as word
processing and productivity tools. While Linux provides its own
analogs for these
applications (for example, TeX), and commercial software support for Linux
is increasing, there are various reasons why a
particular user would want to run Windows as well as
Linux.  If your entire dissertation is written using Microsoft Word,
you may not be able to easily convert it to
TeX or some other format (although the Star Office suite for Linux can
probably do the trick). There are many commercial applications for
Windows that aren't available for Linux, and there's
no reason why you can't use both.</p>

<p>As you might know, Windows 95 and 98 do not fully utilize the
functionality of the x86 processor. On the other hand, Linux runs
completely in the processor's protected mode and exploits all of the
features of the machine, including multiple processors.</p>

<p>We could debate the pros and cons of Windows and
Linux for pages on end.  However, suffice it to say that Linux and
Windows are completely different
entities. Windows is inexpensive (compared to other
commercial operating systems) and has a strong foothold in the PC
computing world.  No other operating system for the PC has reached the
level of popularity of Windows, largely
because the cost of these other operating systems is unapproachable for
most personal computer users. Very few PC users can imagine spending
a thousand dollars or more on the operating system alone. Linux, however, is free,
and you finally have the chance to decide.</p>

<p>We will allow you to make your own judgments of Linux and
Windows based on your expectations and needs. Linux
is not for everybody. But if you have always wanted to run a complete
Unix system at home, without the high cost of other
Unix implementations for the PC, Linux may be what
you're looking for.</p>

<p>There are tools available to allow you to interact between Linux and
Windows. For example, it's easy to access
Windows files from Linux. Development is proceeding on the Wine Windows
emulator, which allows you to run
many popular applications.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.8.3. Linux Versus Windows NT</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-563" />
A number of other advanced operating systems are on the rise in the PC
world. Specifically, Microsoft's Windows NT is becoming very popular
for server computing.</p>

<p>Windows NT, like Linux, is a full multitasking operating system,
supporting multiprocessor machines, several CPU architectures,
virtual memory, networking, security, and so on.
However, the real difference between Linux and Windows NT
is that Linux is a version of Unix and
hence benefits from the contributions of the Unix
community at large.</p>

<p>There are many implementations of Unix from many
vendors.
There is a large push in the Unix community for
standardization in the form of open systems, but no single corporation
controls this design.  Hence, any vendor (or, as it turns out, any
hacker) may implement these standards in an implementation of
Unix.</p>

<p>Windows NT, on the other hand, is a proprietary system. The
interface and design are controlled by a single corporation, Microsoft,
and only that corporation may implement the design. (Don't expect to see
a free version of Windows NT anytime in the near future.) In one sense, this
kind of organization is beneficial: it sets a strict standard for the
programming and user interface unlike that found even in the open systems
community. NT is NT wherever you go.</p>

<p>It seems likely that in the coming years, Linux and Windows NT will be
battling it out for their share of the server computing market. Windows NT
has behind it the full force of the Microsoft marketing machine, while
Linux has a community of thousands of developers helping to advance the
system through the Open Source model. So far, benchmarks of Linux versus
Windows NT have demonstrated that each system has its strengths and
weaknesses; however, Linux wins hands-down in a number of areas, most
notably networking performance. Linux is also much smaller than Windows
NT, has a much better
price-performance ratio, and is generally seen as more stable. (While Windows NT
is known to crash quite often, Linux machines run continuously for months.)
It might seem amazing that "little" Linux gives Microsoft
serious competition, but it's not surprising when you realize how effective
the Open Source development process really is.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.8.4. Other Implementations of Unix</h3>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-565" />
There are several other implementations of Unix for the
personal computer. The Intel x86 architecture lends itself to the
Unix design, and a number of
vendors have taken advantage of this, including Sun (with Solaris x86),
SCO, and BSDI.</p>

<p>
In terms of features, other implementations of Unix
for the PC are quite similar to Linux. You will see that almost all
commercial versions of Unix support roughly the
same software, programming environment, and networking features.
However, there are some major differences between Linux and
commercial versions of Unix. This stems primarily
from Linux's roots as a "personal" Unix
system, rather than one that runs only on large servers (although Linux
is perfectly at home in either environment).</p>

<p>First of all, Linux supports a much wider range of hardware than other
Unix implementations, simply because there is more
demand under Linux to support every crazy brand of sound, graphics,
network, and SCSI board. Plus, under the Open Source model, anyone with
enough time and interest to write a driver for a particular board is
able to do so. We'll cover the hardware requirements for Linux in
the next section.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-566" />
The most important factor to consider for many users is price. The
Linux software is free if you have access to the Internet (or another
computer network) and can download it. If you do not have access to
such a network, you may need to purchase it via mail order on
<span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span>, and such packages often include bundled
documentation and support. Of course, you
may copy Linux from a friend who may already have the software or
share the cost of purchasing it with someone else. If you are planning
to install Linux on a large number of machines, you need only purchase
a single copy of the software; Linux is not distributed with a
"single machine" license.
<a name="INDEX-567" /></p>

<p>The value of commercial Unix implementations should
not be demeaned: along with the price of the software itself, you
usually pay for documentation, support, and assurance of
quality. These are important factors for large institutions, but
personal computer users may not require these benefits. A number of
companies, including Red Hat and LinuxCare, are now providing commercial
Linux support. Caldera, another Linux distributor, offers 24x7
support. In any case,
many businesses and universities are finding that running Linux in a
lab of inexpensive personal computers is preferable to running a
commercial version of Unix in a lab of
workstations. Linux can provide the functionality of a workstation on
PC hardware at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-568" />
<a name="INDEX-569" />
There are other free or inexpensive implementations of
Unix for the x86. One of the most well known is
Free<span class="acronym">BSD</span>, an implementation and port of <span class="acronym">BSD</span>
Unix for the 386. Free<span class="acronym">BSD</span> is
comparable to Linux in many ways, but deciding which one is
"better" depends on your own needs and
expectations. The only strong distinction we can make is that
Linux is developed openly (where any volunteer can aid in the
development process),
while Free<span class="acronym">BSD</span> is developed within a closed team of
programmers who maintain the system. Because of this, serious
philosophical and design differences exist between the two
projects. The goals of the two projects are entirely different: the
goal of Linux is to develop a complete Unix system
from scratch (and have a lot of fun in the process), and the goal of
Free<span class="acronym">BSD</span> is in part to modify the existing
<span class="acronym">BSD</span> code for use on the x86.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-570" />
Net<span class="acronym">BSD</span> is another port of the
<span class="acronym">BSD</span> <span class="acronym">NET</span>/2 distribution to a
number of machines, including the x86. Net<span class="acronym">BSD</span> has a
slightly more open development structure and is comparable to
Free<span class="acronym">BSD</span> in many
respects. Open<span class="acronym">BSD</span> is still another version of
<span class="acronym">BSD</span>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-571" />
<a name="INDEX-572" />
Another project of note is the <span class="acronym">HURD</span>, an effort by the
Free Software Foundation to develop and distribute a free version of
Unix for many platforms. Contact the Free Software
Foundation for more information about this
project.  At the time of this writing, <span class="acronym">HURD</span> is
still in early stages of development and interest in it has been
mostly superseded by Linux.</p>

<p>  Other
inexpensive versions of Unix exist as well, such as
Minix (an academic but useful Unix clone upon which
the early development of Linux was based). Some of these
implementations are of mostly academic interest, while others are
full-fledged systems for real productivity. But many personal
Unix users are moving to Linux.</p>
