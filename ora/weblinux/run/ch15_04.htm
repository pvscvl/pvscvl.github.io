Once you have <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> enabled on your system, you
may wish to configure your system to use the Network File System
(<span class="acronym">NFS</span>) or Network Information Service
(<span class="acronym">NIS</span>). <span class="acronym">NFS</span> allows your system to share files
directly with a network of machines.  File access across
<span class="acronym">NFS</span> is transparent; you simply access the files as
if they were stored on your local disk.  In system administration
terms, one system mounts another's filesystem on a local directory,
just as a local filesystem can be mounted.  <span class="acronym">NFS</span>
also allows you to export filesystems, allowing other systems on the
network to mount your disks directly.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-3157" />
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> (formerly known as the Yellow Pages, or YP, service) is a system
that allows your host to obtain information automatically on user
accounts, groups, filesystem mount points, and other system databases
from servers on the network. For example, let's say you have a
large collection of machines that should have the same user accounts
and groups (information usually found in
<em class="filename">/etc/passwd</em> and
<em class="filename">/etc/group</em>). Users should be able to log into any
of these machines and access their files directly (say, by mounting
their home filesystem from a central location using
<span class="acronym">NFS</span>). Obviously, maintaining user accounts across
many machines would be problematic; in order to add a new user, you
would need to log into each machine and create the user account on
each. When you use <span class="acronym">NIS</span>, however, the system automatically consults
centrally maintained databases across the network for such
information, in addition to local files such as
<em class="filename">/etc/passwd</em>. NIS+ is an enhanced NIS service that is coming into use at some sites.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-3158" />
If your Linux system is to interact with other systems on a
<span class="acronym">LAN</span>, it's quite possible that
<span class="acronym">NFS</span> and <span class="acronym">NIS</span> are in wide use on
your <span class="acronym">LAN</span>. In this section, we'll show you how to
configure your system as an <span class="acronym">NFS</span> and
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> client; that is, to mount remote filesystems
and to participate in an existing <span class="acronym">NIS</span> domain. It is
possible to configure your system as an <span class="acronym">NFS</span> and
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> server, but there are many subtle issues
involved in configuring any Unix or Linux system as
an <span class="acronym">NFS</span>/<span class="acronym">NIS</span> server. Instead of
providing a dangerously incomplete account of server configuration

here, we refer you to O'Reilly's <em class="emphasis">Managing <span class="acronym">NFS</span> and
<span class="acronym">NIS</span></em> by Hal Stern. If you are already familiar with
<span class="acronym">NFS</span>/<span class="acronym">NIS</span> configuration on other
Unix systems, Linux is really no different; the manual
pages and Linux <span class="acronym">HOWTO</span> documents provide all of the specifics.</p>

<a name="INDEX-3163" />
Configuring your system to mount remote filesystems over
<span class="acronym">NFS</span> is a breeze. Assuming that you have
<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> configured and hostname lookup works
correctly, you can simply add a line to your
<em class="filename">/etc/fstab</em> file such as the following:
<blockquote><pre class="code"># device          directory           type    options
allison:/usr	  /fsys/allison/usr   NFS     defaults</pre></blockquote>

<?troff .ne 10?>
As with regular filesystem mounts, be sure to create the mount-point
directory (in this case <em class="filename">/fsys/allison/usr</em>) first.
The line in <em class="filename">/etc/fstab</em> example allows your system
to mount the directory <em class="filename">/usr</em> from the machine
allison on the network.</p>

<p>Before the example <span class="acronym">NFS</span> mount will work, however, the system administrator
for the <span class="acronym">NFS</span> server (here allison) must configure
the system to <em class="emphasis">export</em> the given directory 
(here, <em class="filename">/usr</em>) to your system. On most Unix systems,
this is simply a matter of editing a file, such as 
<em class="filename">/etc/exports</em>, or running a simple command. Exporting
a directory makes it available for other systems to mount it using <span class="acronym">NFS</span>.
It is not necessary for the exported directory to be the root of a filesystem
itself; that is, you can export <em class="filename">/usr</em> even if 
<em class="filename">/usr</em> does not have its own separate filesystem.</p>

<p>In exporting a directory, the administrator may choose to make the directory
available for <em class="emphasis">read-only</em> access. In this case you will
not be able to write to the filesystem when mounted on your system.
You should set the <tt class="literal">options</tt> field of the<em class="filename">/etc/fstab</em> line in the previous example to <tt class="literal">ro</tt>
instead of <tt class="literal">defaults</tt>.</p>

<p>A few words of warning about <span class="acronym">NFS</span>.</p><p>
<img src="figs/bomb.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all,
<span class="acronym">NFS</span> is not very happy when the servers for remote
filesystems go down or the network connection fails. When the
<span class="acronym">NFS</span> server is unreachable for any reason, your
system prints warning messages to the console (or system logs)
periodically. If this is a problem, you can attempt to unmount any
remote filesystems from the affected servers.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-3164" /> <a name="INDEX-3,165" />
<img src="figs/bomb.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another detail to watch out for when
mounting <span class="acronym">NFS</span> filesystems is the owner (UIDs) and
group IDs (GIDs) of the files on the remote filesystem. In order to
access your own files via <span class="acronym">NFS</span>, the user and group
ID for your own account must match those on the <span class="acronym">NFS</span>
server. One easy way to check this is with an <em class="emphasis">ls -l</em>
listing: If the <span class="acronym">UID</span> or <span class="acronym">GID</span> does
not match any local user, <tt class="command">ls</tt> displays the
<span class="acronym">UID</span>/<span class="acronym">GID</span> of files as numbers;
otherwise, the user or group name is printed.</p>

<p>If IDs do not match, you have a few ways to remedy this problem. One is to simply change
the <span class="acronym">UID</span> of your user account (and the <span class="acronym">GID</span> of your primary group) to match
those on the <span class="acronym">NFS</span> server (say, by editing your local 
<em class="filename">/etc/passwd</em> ). This approach requires you to 
<tt class="command">chown</tt> and <tt class="command">chgrp</tt> all of your local
files after making the change. Another solution is to create a separate 
account with matching <span class="acronym">UID</span>/<span class="acronym">GID</span>. However, the best approach may be to use
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> to manage your user and group databases. With this solution, you do not
create your user and group accounts locally; instead, they are provided to
you by an <span class="acronym">NIS</span> server. More on this later.</p>

<p>
<img src="figs/bomb.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Another <span class="acronym">NFS</span> caveat is the restriction of <b class="emphasis-bold">root</b> permissions on <span class="acronym">NFS</span>-mounted filesystems. Unless the
<span class="acronym">NFS</span> server explicitly grants your system <b class="emphasis-bold">root</b>
access on <span class="acronym">NFS</span>-mounted filesystems, you will not
have total access to files when logged in as <b class="emphasis-bold">root</b> on your local system. The reason for this is security: allowing unlimited <b class="emphasis-bold">root</b> access to files on a remote-mounted <span class="acronym">NFS</span> filesystem opens itself up to abuse, especially when the <span class="acronym">NFS</span> server and the <span class="acronym">NFS</span> client are maintained or owned by different people. For this reason, you will not have omnipotent power to access or modify remote-mounted files when logged in as root on your local system.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">15.4.2. Configuring NIS</h3>

<p><span class="acronym">NIS</span> is a complex system, simply because it
is so flexible. <span class="acronym">NIS</span> is a general-purpose network database system, allowing
your machine to transparently access information on user accounts, groups,
filesystems, and so forth, from databases stored across the network. One goal
of <span class="acronym">NIS</span> is to ease network management. Allowing user account information
(such as that stored in <em class="filename">/etc/passwd</em> ), for example, to
be maintained on a single server makes it easy for many machines to share
the same user accounts. In the previous section on <span class="acronym">NFS</span>, we showed how user
and group IDs on the <span class="acronym">NFS</span> server and client should match in order to 
effectively access your files remotely. Using <span class="acronym">NIS</span>
allows your <span class="acronym">UID</span> and <span class="acronym">GID</span> to
be defined from a remote site, not locally.</p>

<p>If your machine is connected at a site where <span class="acronym">NIS</span> is used, chances are you can add your machine as an <span class="acronym">NIS</span> client, thus allowing it to obtain user, group, and other databases directly from the network. To some extent this makes it unnecessary to create local user accounts or groups at all; apart from the locally defined users such as <b class="emphasis-bold">root</b>, <b class="emphasis-bold">bin</b>, and so forth, all other users will be created from the <span class="acronym">NIS</span> server. If you couple the use of <span class="acronym">NIS</span> with mounting user home directories from an <span class="acronym">NFS</span> server, it's also unnecessary to set aside local storage for users. <span class="acronym">NIS</span> can greatly lessen the amount of work you need to do as a system administrator.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-3166" />
<a name="INDEX-3167" /> In an
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> configuration, there may be
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> <em class="emphasis">servers</em>,
<em class="emphasis">slaves</em>, and <em class="emphasis">clients</em>.  As you
can guess, servers are the systems where <span class="acronym">NIS</span>
databases originate and are maintained. <span class="acronym">NIS</span> slaves
are systems to which the server copies its databases. The slaves can
provide the information to other systems, but changes to the databases
must be made from the server. <span class="acronym">NIS</span> clients are those
systems that request database information from servers or slaves.
Slaves are simply used as a way to ease the load on the
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> server; otherwise, all <span class="acronym">NIS</span>
requests would have to be serviced by a single machine.</p>

<p>To completely understand how <span class="acronym">NIS</span> works and to
maintain an <span class="acronym">NIS</span> server is enough material for a
whole book (again, <em class="emphasis">Managing <span class="acronym">NFS</span> and
<span class="acronym">NIS</span></em>). However, when reading about
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> you are likely to come across various terms.
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> was originally named YP. This usage has been discontinued as Yellow Pages is trademarked
in the United Kingdom (it's the phone book, after all).</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-3168" />
There are at least two implementations of <span class="acronym">NIS</span> for Linux: the 
"traditional" <span class="acronym">NIS</span> implementation and a separate implementation
known as "<span class="acronym">NYS</span>" (standing for <span class="acronym">NIS</span>+, YP, and Switch). The <span class="acronym">NIS</span>
client code for the "traditional" implementation is contained
within the standard C library and is already installed on most Linux systems.
(This is necessary to allow programs such as <tt class="command">login</tt>
to transparently access <span class="acronym">NIS</span> databases as well as local system files.)
<a name="INDEX-3169" />
The <span class="acronym">NYS</span> client code is contained within the Network Services Library,
<em class="emphasis">libnsl</em>. Linux systems using <span class="acronym">NYS</span> should have compiled
programs such as <tt class="command">login</tt> against this library. On the other
hand, the new <em class="emphasis">glibc2</em> standard C library comes with support for NIS+.
Different Linux distributions use different versions of the <span class="acronym">NIS</span> or <span class="acronym">NYS</span>
client code, and some use a mixture of the two. To be safe, we'll 
describe how to configure a system for both traditional the <span class="acronym">NIS</span> and 
<span class="acronym">NYS</span> implementations, meaning that no matter which is installed on your
system, it should be able to act as a client.</p>

<p>We do assume here that you have installed and started all the necessary
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> daemon processes (such as
<tt class="command">ypbind</tt> ) used by traditional
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> to talk to the <span class="acronym">NIS</span> server. If your Linux system does not appear to have any
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> support, consult documents such as the
Linux <span class="acronym">NIS HOWTO</span> to configure
it from scratch. Nearly all current Linux distributions come
prepackaged with <span class="acronym">NIS</span> client (and server) support,
and all that's required of you is to edit a few configuration files.</p>

<p>The first step is to set the <span class="acronym">NIS</span> domain in which
your system will be operating. Your network administrators can provide
this information to you. Note that the <span class="acronym">NIS</span> domain
name is not necessarily identical to the <span class="acronym">DNS</span> domain
name, which can be set with the <tt class="command">hostname</tt>
command. For example, if the full hostname of your system is
loomer.vpizza.com, your
<span class="acronym">DNS</span> domain name is vpizza.com. However, your
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> domain name could be entirely different, for
example, vpizzas. The
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> domain name is selected by the
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> server administrators and is not related to the
<span class="acronym">DNS</span> domain name described earlier.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-3170" />
Setting the domain name is usually a matter of running the 
<tt class="command">domainname</tt> command at boot time, perhaps in one
of your system <em class="filename">rc</em> files (such as 
<em class="filename">/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</em> described earlier). You should first
check that <tt class="command">domainname</tt> is not being executed in one
of the existing <em class="filename">rc</em> files. 
The command takes the format:

<blockquote><pre class="code">domainname <em class="replaceable">domain-name</em></pre></blockquote>


for example, <tt class="literal">domainname vpizzas</tt>. The
command itself is usually found in <em class="filename">/sbin/domainname</em>
and may have a slightly different name, such as 
<em class="filename">domainname-yp</em>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-3171" />
<a name="INDEX-3172" />

A slightly different method sets the domain name under
<span class="acronym">NYS</span>.  You should create (or edit) the file
<em class="filename">/etc/yp.conf</em>.  This file should contain two
lines: one specifying the name of your <span class="acronym">NIS</span> domain
and another specifying the hostname of the <span class="acronym">NIS</span>
server.  As an example:

<blockquote><pre class="code">domain vpizzas
ypserver allison.vpizza.com</pre></blockquote>


sets the <span class="acronym">NIS</span> domain name to vpizzas and specifies that allison.vpizza.com should be used as the
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> server. If no <tt class="literal">ypserver</tt> line
is included in this file, the system broadcasts a message on the
network at boot time to determine the name of the
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> server.  Your network administrators can
provide you with the hostname of your preferred <span class="acronym">NIS</span>
server.</p>

<?troff .wcon_off?><p>Once these two steps are complete, your system should be able to
transparently access <span class="acronym">NIS</span> databases. One way to test
this is to query the system for a password database entry from the
<?troff .ne 10?>
<span class="acronym">NIS</span> server.  <a name="INDEX-3173" /> The <tt class="command">ypwhich</tt> queries
specific <span class="acronym">NIS</span> databases, for example:
<blockquote><pre class="code">ypwhich <em class="replaceable">username</em> passwd</pre></blockquote>

If this returns the line from the <span class="acronym">NIS</span> <em class="filename">passwd</em> database 
for the given user, you have successfully queried the <span class="acronym">NIS</span> database.
(One way to verify that the information returned is correct is to run
this same command on another system in your <span class="acronym">NIS</span> domain whose <span class="acronym">NIS</span>
configuration is known to be working.) The <span class="acronym">NIS</span> <em class="filename">passwd</em> 
database is not identical to the <em class="filename">/etc/passwd</em>
file on your system, although it is in the same format.
The Linux <span class="acronym">HOWTO</span> documents contain additional information on troubleshooting
your NIS configuration.</p>
