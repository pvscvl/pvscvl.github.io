<h2 class="sect1">4.14. Changing the Owner, Group,
 and Permissions</h2>

<p>As we said, most of the time you can get by with the default security
the system gives you.  But there are always exceptions,
particularly for system administrators.  To take a simple example,
suppose you are creating a directory under <em class="filename">/home</em> for a
new user.  You have to create everything as root, but when you're
done you have to change the ownership to the user; otherwise, that
user won't be able to use the files!  (Fortunately, if you use the
<tt class="command">adduser</tt> command discussed in the section

"<a href="ch05_07.htm">Section 5.7.5, "Creating Accounts"</a>" in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Essential System Management"</a>, it takes
care of ownership for you.)</p>

<p>Similarly, there are certain utilities such as <span class="acronym">UUCP</span> and News that have
their own users.  No one ever logs in as UUCP or News, but
 
 
those users and groups must exist so that the utilities can do their
job in a secure manner.  In general, the last step when installing
software is usually to change the owner, group, and permissions as the
documentation tells you to do.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1131" />
<a name="INDEX-1132" />
The <tt class="command">chown</tt> command changes the owner of a file, and the
<tt class="command">chgrp</tt> command changes the group.  On Linux, only
root can use
<tt class="command">chown</tt> for changing ownership of a file, but any
user can change the group to another group he belongs to.</p>

<p>  
So after installing some
software named <em class="filename">sampsoft</em>, you might change both the owner and
the group to bin by executing:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>chown bin sampsoft</b></tt> 
# <tt class="userinput"><b>chgrp bin sampsoft</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>You could also do this in one step by using the dot notation:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># <tt class="userinput"><b>chown bin.bin sampsoft</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="INDEX-1133" />
The syntax for changing permissions is more complicated.  The
permissions can also be called the file's "mode," and the command
that changes permissions is <tt class="command">chmod</tt>.  Let's start our exploration of
this command through a simple example; say you've written a neat
program in Perl or Tcl named <em class="filename">header</em>, and you want to be able to
execute it. You would type the following command:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>chmod +x header</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>The plus sign means "add a permission," and the <tt class="literal">x</tt> indicates
which permission to add.</p>

<p>If you want to remove execute permission, use a minus sign in
place of a plus:
<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>chmod -x header</b></tt></pre></blockquote></p>

<p>This command assigns permissions to all levels--user,
group, and other.  Let's say that you are secretly into software
hoarding and don't want anybody to use the command but yourself.
(No, that's too cruel; let's say instead that you think the script is
buggy and want to protect other people from hurting themselves until
you've exercised it.)  You can assign execute permission just to
yourself through the command:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>chmod u+x header</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>Whatever goes before the plus sign is the level of permission, and
whatever goes after is the type of permission.  User permission (for
yourself) is u, group permission is
<tt class="literal">g</tt>, and other is <tt class="literal">o</tt>. So, to assign permission to both
yourself and the file's group, enter:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>chmod ug+x header</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p> 
You can also assign multiple types of permissions:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>chmod ug+rwx header</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>There are a few more shortcuts you can learn from the
<tt class="command">chmod</tt> manual page in order to impress someone looking over
your shoulder, but they don't offer any functionality besides what
we've shown you.</p>

<p>As arcane as the syntax of the mode argument may seem, there's another
syntax that is even more complicated.  We have to describe it though,
for several reasons.  First of all, there are several situations that 
cannot be covered by the syntax, called <em class="emphasis">symbolic
mode</em>, that we've just shown. Second, people often use the other syntax, called <em class="emphasis">absolute
mode,</em> in their documentation.  Third, there are times you may
actually find the absolute mode more convenient.</p>

<p>To understand absolute mode, you have to think in terms of bits and octal notation.  Don't worry, it's not too hard.  A typical mode
contains three characters, corresponding to the three levels of
permission (user, group, and other).  These levels are illustrated in
<a href="ch04_14.htm">Figure 4-3</a>.  Within each level, there are three bits
corresponding to read, write, and execute permission.</p>

<a name="x-100-3-mode-layout" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/rl3_0403.gif" alt="Figure 4-3" />
</div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-3. Bits in absolute mode</h4><p>Let's say you want to give yourself read permission and no permission
to anybody else.  You want to specify just the bit represented by the
number 400.  So the <tt class="command">chmod</tt> command would be:

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>chmod 400 header</b></tt></pre></blockquote></p>

<p>To give read permission to everybody, choose the correct bit from each
level: 400 for yourself, 40 for your group, and 4 for other.  The full
command is:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>chmod 444 header</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<?troff .Nd 10?><p> 
This is like using a mode <tt class="literal">+r</tt>, except that it simultaneously
removes any write or execute permission.  (To be precise, it's just
like a mode of <tt class="literal">=r</tt>, which we didn't mention earlier.  The equal
sign means "assign these rights and no others.")</p>

<p>To give read and execute permission to everybody, you have to add up
the read and execute bits.  400 plus 100 is 500, for instance.</p>

<p>So the
corresponding command is:
<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>chmod 555 header</b></tt></pre></blockquote></p>

<p> 
which is the same as <tt class="literal">=rx</tt>.  To give someone full access, you
would specify that digit as a 7--the sum of 4, 2, and 1.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1134" />

One final trick: how to set the default mode that is assigned to each
file you create (with a text editor, the &gt; redirection operator, and so on). You do so by executing a <tt class="command">umask</tt> command, or
putting one in your shell's start-up file.  This file could be called
<em class="filename">.bashrc</em>, <em class="filename">.cshrc</em>, or something else depending on the
shell you use (we'll discuss startup files in the next section).</p>

<p> 
 
 
 
 
The <tt class="command">umask</tt> command takes an argument like the absolute mode
in <tt class="command">chmod</tt>, but the meaning of the bits is inverted.  You have
to determine the access you want to grant for user, group, and other,
and subtract each digit from 7.  That gives you a three-digit mask.</p>

<p>For instance, say you want yourself to have all permissions (7), your
group to have read and execute permissions (5), and others to have no
permissions (0).  Subtract each bit from 7 and you get 0 for yourself,
2 for your group, and 7 for other.  So the command to put in your
start-up file is:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">umask 027</pre></blockquote>

<p>A strange technique, but it works.  The <tt class="command">chmod</tt> command looks
at the mask when it interprets your mode; for instance, if you assign
execute mode to a file at creation time, it will assign execute permission for you
and your group, but will exclude others because the mask doesn't
permit them to have any access.
