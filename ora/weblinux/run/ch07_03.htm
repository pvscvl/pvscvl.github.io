<h2 class="sect1">7.3. Using RPM</h2>

<p>RPM, the Red Hat Package Manager, is a tool that automates
<a name="INDEX-1616" />
<a name="INDEX-1617" />
<a name="INDEX-1618" />
<a name="INDEX-1619" />
<a name="INDEX-1620" />
	  the installation of
	  software binaries and remembers what files are needed
	  so that you can be assured the software will run properly.
	  Despite the name, RPM is not Red 
	  Hat-specific, but is used in many other distributions nowadays,
<?troff .ne 10?>
	  
including SuSE and Caldera. Using RPM makes installing 
	  and uninstalling software a lot easier.</p>

<p>The basic idea of RPM is that you have a database of
	  packages and the files that belong to a package. When you
	  install a new package, the information about this package is
	  recorded in the database. Then, when you want to uninstall the
	  package, for every file of the package, RPM checks whether there 
	  are other packages installed using this file, too. If this is
	  the case, the file in question is not deleted.</p>

<p>In addition, RPM tracks dependencies. Each package can be
	  dependent on one or more other packages. When you install a
	  package, RPM checks whether the packages the new package is
	  dependent on are already installed. If not, it
	  informs you about the dependency and refuses to install the
	  package.</p>

<p>The dependencies are also used for removing packages: when 
	  you want to uninstall a package that other packages are still
	  dependent upon, RPM tells you about this, too, and refuses to
	  execute the task.</p>

<p>The increased convenience of using RPM packages comes at a 
	  price, however: First, as a developer, it is significantly more
	  difficult to make a RPM package than to simply pack everything
	  in a <tt class="command">tar</tt> archive. And
	  second, it is not
	  possible to retrieve just one file from a RPM package; you have
	  to install everything or nothing.</p>

<p>If you already have an RPM system, installing RPM packages
	  is very easy. Let's say that you have a RPM package called
	  <em class="filename">SuperFrob-4.i386.rpm</em> (RPM package always have 
	  the extension <em class="filename">.rpm</em>; the
	  <em class="filename">i386</em> indicates that this is a binary
	  package compiled for Intel machines). You could then install it
	  with:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -i SuperFrob-4.i386.rpm</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>Instead of <em class="emphasis">-i</em>, you can also use the
	  long-named version of this option; choose whatever you like
	  better:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm --install SuperFrob-4.i386.rpm</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>If everything goes well, there will be no output. If you
	  want RPM to be more verbose, you can try:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -ivh SuperFrob-4.i386.rpm</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>This prints the name of the package plus a number of hash
	  marks, so that you can see how the installation progresses.</p>

<p>If the package you want to install needs another package
	  that is not yet installed, you will get something like the
	  following:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -i SuperFrob-4.i386.rpm</b></tt>
failed dependencies:
        frobnik-2 is needed by SuperFrob-4</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you see this, you have to hunt for the package
	  <em class="emphasis">frobnik-2</em> and install this first. Of course,
	  this package can itself be dependent on other packages
	  again.</p>

<p>If you want to update a package, use the
	  <em class="emphasis">-U</em> or <em class="emphasis">- -update</em> option
	  (which is just the 
	  <em class="emphasis">-i</em> option combined with a few more implied options):</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -U SuperFrob-5.i386.rpm</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>Uninstalling a package is done with the
	  <em class="emphasis">-e</em> or <em class="emphasis">--erase</em> option. In
	  this case, you do not specify 
	  the package file (you might not have that around any longer),
	  but the package name and version number:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -e SuperFrob-5</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>Besides the options described so far that alter the state
		of your system, the <em class="emphasis">-q</em> option
		provides various kinds of informations about everything that is 
		recorded in the RPM database as well as package files. Here are some 
		useful things you can do with <em class="emphasis">-q</em>:</p>

<ul><li><p>Find out the version number of an installed package:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger# <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -q SuperFrob</b></tt>
SuperFrob-5</pre></blockquote></li><li><p>Get a list of all installed packages:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger# <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -qa</b></tt>
SuperFrob-5
OmniFrob-3
...
libc-5.4.47-1</pre></blockquote></li><li><p>Find out to which package a file belongs:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger# <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -qf /usr/bin/dothefrob</b></tt>
SuperFrob-5
tigger# <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -qf /home/kalle/.xinitrc</b></tt>
file /home/kalle/.xinitrc is not owned by any package</pre></blockquote></li><li><p>Display information about the specified package:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger# <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -qi <em class="replaceable">rpm</em> </b></tt>

Summary     : rpm - Red Hat Package Manager
Description :
rpm (Red Hat Package Manager) is the main tool for managing software 
packages of the SuSE Linux distribution. rpm can be used to install
<?troff .ne 10?>
and remove software packages; with rpm it's easy to update packages.  
rpm keep track of all these manipulations in a central database. This 
way it is possible to get an overview of all installed packages; rpm 
also supports database queries.</pre></blockquote></li><li><p>Show the files that will be installed for the specified package file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger# <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -qpl SuperFrob-5.i386.rpm</b></tt>
/usr/bin/dothefrob
/usr/bin/frobhelper
/usr/doc/SuperFrob/Installation
/usr/doc/SuperFrob/README
/usr/man/man1/dothefrob.1</pre></blockquote></li></ul><p>What we've just finished showing are the basic modes of operation, which are
	  supplemented by a large number of additional options. You can
	  check those in the manual page for the <tt class="command">rpm</tt>
	  command.</p>

<p>If you are faced with a RPM package that you want to
	  install, but have a system like Slackware or Debian that is not
	  based on RPM, things get a little bit more
<?troff \p?> difficult.</p>

<p>You can either use the fairly self-explanatory command
<tt class="command">alien</tt> that can convert between various package
formats and comes with most distributions, or you can build the RPM
database from scratch.</p>

<p>The first thing 
you have to do in this latter case is to get the <tt class="command">rpm</tt>
program itself. You can download it from <a href="../../../../../../www.rpm.org/">http://www.rpm.org</a>. Follow the installation instructions to build and install it; if you have the C compiler <tt class="command">gcc</tt> installed on your system, there should be no problems with this.</p>

<p>The next task is to initialize the RPM database.
	  Distributions that come with RPM do the initialization
	  automatically, but on other systems you will have to issue
	  the command:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm --initdb</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>This command creates several files in the directory
	  <em class="filename">/var/lib/rpm</em>. The directory
	  <em class="filename">/var/lib</em> should already exist; if
	  it doesn't, create it with the <tt class="command">mkdir</tt>
	  command first.</p>

<p>Now you can install RPM packages the normal way, but since 
	  you have not installed the basic parts of the system like the C
	  library with RPM, you will get errors like the following:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -i SuperFrob-4.i386.rpm</b></tt>
failed dependencies:
        libm.so.5 is needed by SuperFrob-4
        libdl.so.1 is needed by SuperFrob-4
        libc.so.5 is needed by SuperFrob-4</pre></blockquote>

<p>because those files are not recorded in the RPM
	  database. Of course, you really do have those files on your system;
	  otherwise most programs wouldn't run. For RPM to work, you
	  must tell it not to care about any dependencies. You do this by
	  specifying the command-line option
	  <em class="emphasis">- -nodeps</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">tigger # <tt class="userinput"><b>rpm -i --nodeps SuperFrob-4.i386.rpm</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>Now, RPM will install the package without complaining.</p>

<p>With this information, you should be able to administer
	  your RPM-based system. If you want to know more, read the manual 
	  page for the <tt class="command">rpm</tt> command or check out
	  <a href="../../../../../../www.rpm.org/">http://www.rpm.org</a>.</p>
