<h2 class="sect1">1.6. About Linux's Copyright</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-532" />
<a name="INDEX-533" />
<a name="INDEX-534" />
<a name="INDEX-535" />
Linux is covered by what is known as the <span class="acronym">GNU</span>
<em class="emphasis">General Public License</em>, or
<em class="emphasis">GPL</em>. The <span class="acronym">GPL</span>, which is sometimes
referred to as a "copyleft" license, was developed for
the <span class="acronym">GNU</span> project by the Free Software Foundation. It
<a name="INDEX-536" />
makes a number of provisions for the distribution and modification of
"free software." "Free," in this sense, refers
to freedom, not just cost. The <span class="acronym">GPL</span> has always been
subject to misinterpretation, and we hope that this summary will help
you to understand the extent and goals of the <span class="acronym">GPL</span>
and its effect on Linux. A complete copy of the <span class="acronym">GPL</span>
is available at <a href="../../../../../../www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-537" />
Originally, Linus Torvalds released Linux under a license more
restrictive than the <span class="acronym">GPL</span>, which allowed the
software to be freely distributed and modified, but prevented any
money changing hands for its distribution and use.  The
<span class="acronym">GPL</span> allows people to sell and make profit from free
software, but doesn't allow them to restrict the right for others to
distribute the software in any way.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-538" />
<a name="INDEX-539" />
First, we should explain that "free software" covered
by the <span class="acronym">GPL</span> is <em class="emphasis">not</em> in the public domain. Public
domain software is software that is not copyrighted and is literally
owned by the public. Software covered by the <span class="acronym">GPL</span>,
on the other hand, is copyrighted to the author or authors. This means
that the software is protected by standard international copyright
laws and that the author of the software is legally defined. Just
because the software may be freely distributed doesn't mean it
is in the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-540" />
<span class="acronym">GPL</span>-licensed software is also not
"shareware." Generally, "shareware" software
is owned and copyrighted by the author, but the author requires users
to send in money for its use after distribution. On the other hand,
software covered by the <span class="acronym">GPL</span> may be distributed and used free of
charge.</p>

<p>The <span class="acronym">GPL</span> also allows people to take and modify free software, and distribute
their own versions of the software. However, any derived works from <span class="acronym">GPL</span>
software must also be covered by the <span class="acronym">GPL</span>. In other words, a company could
not take Linux, modify it, and sell it under a restrictive license. If any
software is derived from Linux, that software must be covered by the <span class="acronym">GPL</span>
as well.</p>

<p>People and organizations can distribute <span class="acronym">GPL</span> software
for a fee and can even make a profit from its sale and distribution. However,
in selling <span class="acronym">GPL</span> software, the distributor can't take those rights away from
the purchaser; that is, if you purchase <span class="acronym">GPL</span> software from some source, you
may distribute the software for free or sell it yourself as well.</p>

<p>This might sound like a contradiction at first. Why sell software for
profit when the <span class="acronym">GPL</span> allows anyone to obtain it for free?
When a company bundles a large amount of free software on a
<span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> and distributes it, they need to charge for the
overhead of producing and distributing the <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span>,
and they may
even decide to make profit from the sale of the software. This is allowed
by the <span class="acronym">GPL</span>.</p>

<p>Organizations that sell free software must follow certain restrictions set
forth in the <span class="acronym">GPL</span>. First, they can't restrict the rights of users who purchase
the software. This means that if you buy a <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> of <span class="acronym">GPL</span> software, you can
copy and distribute that <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> free of charge, or
you can resell it yourself.
Second, distributors must make it obvious to users that the software is
indeed covered by the <span class="acronym">GPL</span>. Third, distributors must provide, free of charge, the complete
source code for the software being distributed, or they must point their
customers on demand to where the software can be downloaded. This will
allow anyone who
purchases <span class="acronym">GPL</span> software to make modifications of that software.</p>

<p>Allowing a company to distribute and sell free software is a very good thing.
Not everyone has access to the Internet to download software, such as Linux,
for free. The <span class="acronym">GPL</span> allows companies to sell and distribute software
to those people who do not have free (cost-wise) access to the software.
For example, many organizations sell Linux on floppy, tape, or <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span>
via mail order, and make profit from these sales. The developers of Linux
may never see any of this profit; that is the understanding that is reached
between the developer and the distributor when software is licensed by the
<span class="acronym">GPL</span>. In other words, Linus knew that companies may wish to sell Linux and
that he may not see a penny of the profits from those sales.</p>

<p>In the free software world, the important issue is not money.
The goal of free software is always to develop and
distribute fantastic software and to allow anyone to obtain and use it.
In the next section, we'll discuss how this applies to the development
of Linux.</p>
