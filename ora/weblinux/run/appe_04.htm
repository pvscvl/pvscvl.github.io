<h2 class="sect1">E.4. Installation</h2>

<p>Each distribution uses a different installation method; in addition,
the procedure for each major platform is somewhat different.  Hence,
it is impossible to go into any great depth in this appendix.  A few
particular issues are worth examining, however.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">E.4.1. Booting Linux</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-247" />

While it is technically possible to boot directly into Linux on
virtually any system, there are numerous challenges involved in
writing a bootloader that can operate outside any operating system.
At the moment, Amigas, Ataris, and VME systems can be booted without
launching native operating systems (using m68k-specific versions of
LILO).</p>

<p>For other platforms, and for specialized applications on Amigas,
booters that run under the native OS (similar to Loadlin on Intel) are
available.  The Amiga and Atari booters are fairly rudimentary,
although the latter does include some support for obtaining kernels
over the network.  The Macintosh booter, called Penguin, is a native
MacOS application that provides a more user-friendly interface and
allows configuration of some settings (such as screen settings) that
the Mac porters haven't been able to determine how to change under
Linux.  Other systems are currently using hacked bootloaders from
other operating systems or are launched from hardware boot
managers.</p>

<p>Allowed boot options for Linux/m68k are covered in the file
<em class="filename">kernel-options.txt</em> in the <em class="filename">Documentation/m68k</em>
directory of the kernel source tree.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">E.4.2. Partitioning and Filesystems</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-252" />
<a name="INDEX-253" />

<a name="INDEX-255" />
<a name="INDEX-256" />
Each platform uses its own partitioning scheme or one adapted from
another operating system.  As a general rule, however, the
partitioning schemes are more straightforward than those based on MS-DOS
systems.  Amigas, Ataris, and Macs don't distinguish between primary
and logical partitions and can generally be configured without the
disk-size issues that plague Intel systems (the 1024-cylinder limit,
for example).  Because of the extensive support in the Linux kernel
for myriad disk-partitioning schemes, native HP/UX and SunOS
partition tables can be used on those platforms.</p>

<p>Although each partitioning scheme is different, under Linux they
generally use <tt class="command">fdisk</tt> utilities based on the original
<tt class="command">fdisk</tt> for DOS-based platforms, so the menus are
similar with a few exceptions; for example, the Amiga
<tt class="command">fdisk</tt> program provides the ability to set the AmigaOS
mountable flag in the partition table.</p>

<p>Before booting Linux for the first time, some people may want to use a
more familiar GUI-based partitioning tool under their existing OS.
Amiga users should use either <tt class="command">HDToolbox</tt> or the tool
that came with their SCSI controller; Atari users should use a TOS-partition editor like SCSITool; and Mac users can use Apple's
<tt class="command">HD SC Setup</tt> or the m68k version of the
<tt class="command">pdisk</tt> utility from LinuxPPC Inc. (see <a href="appd_01.htm">Appendix D, "LinuxPPC: Installing Linux
 on PowerPC Computers"</a> for detailed instructions on how to
use it).  VME systems, along with the Q40 and Q60, use the MS-DOS
partition format (like Linux on Intel and Alpha).  Users of other
platforms should consult their native operating system's documentation.</p>

<p>Native filesystems are highly supported in recent kernels. All of the
Amiga's filesystem formats (OFS and FFS) are supported, as are the
Atari's GEMDOS (actually a variant of the MS-DOS filesystem) and the
Mac's HFS.  The native filesystems on other platforms are generally
available as well, through the kernel's support for System V and
Berkeley FFS filesystems.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">E.4.3. The X Window System</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-257" />

Most people have a love-hate relationship with configuring X.  On
Linux/m68k, the situation is no different; however, due to the
capabilities of the framebuffer device interface, configuration is
somewhat easier than on other platforms.</p>

<p>Linux/m68k uses the FBDev X server from XFree86, which is a standard
XFree86 server designed for the framebuffer device.  This allows video
settings to be inherited from the Linux console instead of requiring
you to extensively edit your <tt class="command">XF86Config</tt> file.  You
may want to adjust the depth settings, but you can leave other
settings alone.</p>

<p>Users of machines with high-resolution graphics cards may be
interested in using one resolution for the console and higher
resolutions for X. This option requires that the framebuffer driver in
question supports programming the video mode (i.e., it does not inherit
the mode from the machine's native boot loader or it has only one fixed
mode). Programmable video modes may be added to the
<tt class="command">XF86Config</tt> file. The format of the mode information
is identical to the format used in <tt class="command">XF86Config</tt> on
all other architectures; you can also output appropriate mode lines
from the <tt class="command">fbset</tt> utility.</p>

<p>The X server and console also work together in that you can adjust
framebuffer settings on the command line using the
<tt class="command">fbset</tt> program and then output the settings in a
format that can be copied into your <tt class="command">XF86Config</tt> file
for switching modes within X.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the <tt class="command">XF86Config</tt> files shipped with
distributions usually include extraneous information that is not
relevant to m68k users (and only serves to confuse them).  This is an
area of concern that the Linux/m68k team plans to address in the near
future.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">E.4.4. Rebooting the System</h3>

<p>Linux/m68k uses the PC-style Ctrl-Alt-Del key combination to reboot the
system.  Because of hardware limitations, Linux/m68k is not able to
safely trap the machine-specific reboot keys (like the Amiga's
Ctrl-Amiga-Amiga sequence) and reset buttons. You can also reboot
the system using the <tt class="command">shutdown</tt> command as described in <a href="ch05_05.htm">Section 5.5, "Shutting Down the System"</a> in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Essential System Management"</a>.</p>
