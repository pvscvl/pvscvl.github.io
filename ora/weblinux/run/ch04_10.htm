<h2 class="sect1">4.10. What Is a Command?</h2>

<p>We've said that Unix offers a huge number of
commands and that you can add new ones.  This makes it radically
different from most operating systems, which contain a strictly
limited table of commands.  So what are Unix
commands, and how are they stored? On Unix, a command is simply a file.  For instance,
the <tt class="command">ls</tt> command is a binary file located in the
directory <em class="filename">bin</em>.  So, instead of
<tt class="command">ls</tt>, you could enter the full pathname, also known
as the <em class="emphasis">absolute pathname</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>/bin/ls</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p>This makes Unix very flexible and powerful.  To
provide a new utility, a system administrator can simply install it in
a standard directory where commands are located.  There can also be
different versions of a command--for instance, you can offer a
new version of a utility for testing in one place while leaving the
old version in another place, and users can choose the one they want.</p>

<p> 
Here's a common problem: sometimes you enter a command that you expect
to be on the system, but you receive a message such as "Not found."
The problem may be that the command is located in a directory that
your shell is not searching.  The list of directories where your shell looks
for commands is called your path.  Enter the following to see what
your path is (remember the dollar sign!):
<a name="INDEX-1097" />
<a name="INDEX-1098" />
<a name="INDEX-1099" />
<a name="INDEX-1100" />
<a name="INDEX-1101" /></p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>echo $PATH</b></tt> 
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/bin:/usr/lib/java/bin:\
/usr/games:/usr/bin/TeX:.</pre></blockquote>

<p> 
This takes a little careful eyeballing.  The output is a series of
pathnames separated by colons.  The first pathname, for this
particular user, is <em class="filename">/usr/local/bin</em>.  The second is
<em class="filename">/usr/bin</em>, and so on.  So if two versions of a
command exist, one in <em class="filename">/usr/local/bin</em> and the other in
<em class="filename">/usr/bin</em>, the one in <em class="filename">/usr/local/bin</em> will execute. The last pathname in this example is simply a dot; it refers to the
current directory.  Unlike <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>, Unix does not look automatically in
your current directory.  You have to tell it to explicitly, as shown
here.  Some people think it's a bad idea to look in the current
directory, for security reasons.  (An intruder who gets into your
account might copy a malicious program to one of your working
directories.) However, this mostly applies to root, normal users
generally do not need to worry about this.</p>

<?troff .wcon_off?><p> 
 
If a command is not found, you have to figure out where it is on the
system and add that directory to your path.  The manual page should tell
you where it is.  Let's say you find it in <em class="filename">/usr/sbin</em>, where
a number of system administration commands are installed.  You
realize you need access to these system administration commands,
so you enter the following (note that the first <tt class="literal">PATH</tt> doesn't have a
dollar sign, but the second one does):</p>

<p> 
 
 
<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin</b></tt></pre></blockquote></p>

<p>This command adds <em class="filename">/usr/sbin</em>, but makes it the
last directory that is searched.  The
command is saying, "Make my path equal to the old path plus
<em class="filename">/usr/sbin</em>."</p>

<p>The previous command works for some shells but not others.
It's fine for most Linux users, who are working in a Bourne-compatible
shell like <tt class="command">bash</tt>.  But if you use <tt class="command">csh</tt> or <tt class="command">tcsh</tt> you need to
issue the following command instead:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">set path = ( $PATH /usr/sbin )</pre></blockquote>

<p> 
 
Finally, there are a few commands that are not files; <tt class="command">cd</tt> is
one.  Most of these commands affect the shell itself, and therefore
have to be understood and executed by the shell.  Because they are
part of the shell, they are called built-in commands.</p>
