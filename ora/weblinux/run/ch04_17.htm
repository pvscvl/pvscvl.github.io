We're including this section because you should start to be interested
in what's running on your system behind your back.</p>

<p>Many modern computer activities are too complex for the system
simply to look at a file or some other static resource.  Sometimes
these activities need to
interact with another running process.</p>

<p>For instance, take <span class="acronym">FTP</span>, which you may have used to download
some Linux-related documents or software.
When you <span class="acronym">FTP</span> to
another system, another program has to be running on that system to
accept your connection and interpret your commands.   So there's a
program running on that system called <tt class="command">ftpd</tt>.  The <em class="emphasis">d</em> in
 
 
the name stands for <em class="emphasis">daemon</em>, which is a quaint Unix term for a
server that runs in the background all the time.  Most daemons handle
network activities.</p>

<p> 
You've probably heard of the buzzword <em class="emphasis">client/server</em> enough to
make you sick, but here it is in action--it has been in action for
years on Unix.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1178" />
<a name="INDEX-1179" />
Daemons start up when the system is booted.  To see how they get
started, look in the <em class="filename">/etc/inittab</em> and <em class="filename">/etc/inetd.conf</em>
files, as well as distribution-specific configuration files. We won't
go into their formats here.  But each line in these 
files lists a program that runs when the system starts. You can find
the distribution-specific files either by checking the documentation
that came with your system or by
<?troff \p?> looking for pathnames that occur more 
often than others in <em class="filename">/etc/inittab</em>. Those normally 
indicate the directory tree where your distribution stores its system
startup-files.</p>

<p> 
To give an example of how your system uses <em class="filename">/etc/inittab</em>,
look at one or more lines
with the string <tt class="literal">getty</tt> or <tt class="literal">agetty</tt>.  This is the program that
listens at a
terminal (tty) waiting for a user to log in.  It's the program that
displays the <tt class="literal">login :</tt> prompt we talked about at the beginning of
this chapter.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1180" />

The <em class="filename">/etc/inetd.conf</em> file represents a more complicated way of
running programs--another level of indirection.  The idea behind
<em class="filename">/etc/inetd.conf</em> is that it would waste a lot of system
resources if a dozen or more daemons were spinning idly, waiting for a
request to come over the network.
So, instead, the system starts up a single daemon named
<tt class="command">inetd</tt>.  This daemon listens for connections from
clients on other machines, and when an incoming connection is made,
starts up the appropriate daemon to handle it. For example, when an
incoming <span class="acronym">FTP</span> connection is made,
<tt class="command">inetd</tt> starts up the <span class="acronym">FTP</span> daemon
(<tt class="command">ftpd</tt>) to manage the connection. In this way, the
only network daemons running are those actually in use.</p>

<p>In the next section, we'll show you how to see which daemons are
running on your system.  There's a daemon for every service offered by
the system to other systems on a network: <tt class="command">fingerd</tt> to handle
remote <tt class="command">finger</tt> requests, <tt class="command">rwhod</tt> to handle
<tt class="command">rwho</tt> requests, and so on.  A few daemons also handle
nonnetworking services, such as <tt class="command">kerneld</tt>, which 
handles the automatic loading of modules into the kernel.</p>
