<h2>Linux Documentation Project Manuals</h2>


<p><b>Linux Installation and Getting Started</b>, <em>Matt Welsh, et. al., 1992-1994</em><p> A user's guide for Linux, a prototype for this book.  The manual is
 targeted primarily for the Unix novice and as
 such does not contain the broad scope of information that is in this
 book. If you are new to Unix and need more
 information, Linux Installation and Getting
 Started is a great place to look.
    <p><b>Linux Users' Guide</b>, <em>Larry Greenfield, 1993-1994</em><p> An introduction to the most important commands and programs people
 use on Linux.  It is not limited to common Unix
 utilities and the use of the shell (although it has a lot of
 essential information in these areas).  It also covers a wide range
 of activities that you will find yourself doing on Linux, such as
 manipulating windows on the X Window System and using the
 <tt class="command">vi</tt> and Emacs editors.  The book is particularly
 helpful for people who have not used Unix or X
 before.
    </p><p>
 

 
<p><b>The Linux System Administrator's Guide</b>, <em>Lars Wirzenius, 1995</em><p> This is a guide to running and configuring a Linux system. There are
 many issues relating to systems administration that are specific to
 Linux, such as the needs for supporting a user community, filesystem
 maintenance, backups, and more. This guide covers many of the associated tasks.
    </p><p>
 
<p><b>Linux Network Administrator's Guide</b>, <em>Olaf Kirch, 1995, O'Reilly &amp; Associates</em><p> An extensive and complete guide to networking under Linux, including 
 <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span>, <span class="acronym">UUCP</span>, <span class="acronym">SLIP</span>, and more. This book is a very good read; it
 contains a wealth of information on many subjects, clarifying the
 many confusing aspects of network configuration.  It has been
 published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates as a companion volume to this
 book.
    

<p><b>Linux Programmer's Guide</b>, <em>Sven Goldt, John D. Harper, Svenvan der Meer, Matt Welsh, 1995</em><p> A listing of functions and programming techniques, some familiar to
 those who have programmed on other common versions of
 Unix and some quite specific to Linux.  While
 there are some hints and examples, it currently is a brief
 description of what is available. Contains particularly full
 sections on interprocess communication, curses, and porting from
 other Unix systems to Linux.
    
<p><b>The Linux Kernel</b>, <em>David A. Rusling, 1999</em><p>Principals and concepts behind the design of Linux.

 creator of LaTeX.
    </p><p>

<p><b>Practical SGML, Second Edition</b>, <em>Eric van Herwijnen, 1994, Kluwer Academic Publishers</em><p> Provides an excellent introduction to the Standard Generalized
 Markup Language (ISO 8879-1986) for creating structured documents.

 Language.  Contains the complete text of the standard for SGML, ISO
 8879-1986, with the author's annotations. Charles Goldfarb is the
 father of SGML and was the technical leader of the committee that developed the standard.
