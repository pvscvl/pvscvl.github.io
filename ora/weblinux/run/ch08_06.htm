It's not difficult to make a simple mistake as root that
can cause real problems on your system, such as not being able to
log in or losing important files. This is especially true for 
novice system administrators who are beginning to explore the system.
Nearly all new system admins learn their lessons the hard way, by
being forced to recover from a real emergency. In this section, we'll
give you some hints about what to do when the inevitable happens.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1948" />
<a name="INDEX-1949" />
You should always be aware of preventative measures that reduce the
impact of such emergencies. For example, take backups of all important
system files, if not the entire system. If you happen to have a Linux
distribution on <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span>, the
<span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> itself acts as a wonderful backup for most
files (as long as you have a way to access the
<span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> in a tight situation--more on this
later). Backups are vital to recovering 

from many problems; don't let
the many weeks of hard work configuring your Linux system go to waste.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1950" />
Also, be sure to keep notes on your system configuration, such as your
partition table entries, partition sizes and types, and
filesystems. If you were to trash your partition table somehow, fixing
the problem might be a simple matter of rerunning
<tt class="command">fdisk</tt>, but this only helps as long as you can
remember what your partition table used to look like. (True story: one of the
authors once did this by booting a blank floppy, and had
<em class="emphasis">no</em> record of the partition table contents.
Needless to say, some guesswork was necessary to restore the partition
table to its previous state!)</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1951" />

Of course, for any of these measures to work, you'll need a way
to boot the system and access your files, or recover from backups, in
an emergency. This is best accomplished with an "emergency
disk," or "root disk." Such a disk contains a small
root filesystem with the basics required to run a Linux system from floppy--just the essential commands and system
files, as well as tools to repair problems. Such a disk is used by
booting a kernel from another floppy (see the section

"<a href="ch05_02.htm">Section 5.2.1, "Using a Boot Floppy"</a>" in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Essential System Management"</a>) and telling the kernel to use the
emergency disk as the root filesystem.</p>

<p>Most distributions of Linux include such a boot/root floppy
combination as the original installation floppies. The installation disks
usually contain a small Linux system that can be used to install the
software as well as perform basic system maintenance.  Some systems
include both the kernel and root filesystem on one floppy, but this
severely limits the number of files that can be stored on the
emergency disk. How useful these disks are as a maintenance
tool depends on whether they contain the tools (such
as <tt class="command">fsck</tt>, <tt class="command">fdisk</tt>, a small editor
such as <tt class="command">vi</tt>, and so on) necessary for problem
recovery. Some distributions have such an elaborate installation
process, the installation floppies don't have room for much else.</p>

<p>At any rate, you can create such a root floppy yourself. Being able to
do this from scratch requires an intimate knowledge of what's required
to boot and use a Linux system, and exactly what can be trimmed down
and cut out. For example, you could dispose of the startup programs
<tt class="command">init</tt>, <tt class="command">getty</tt>, and
<tt class="command">login</tt>, as long as you know how to rig things so
that the kernel starts a shell on the console instead of using a real
boot procedure.  (One way to do this is to have
<em class="filename">/etc/init</em> be a symbolic link to
<em class="filename">/sbin/bash</em>, all on the floppy filesystem.)</p>

<p>While we can't cover all of the details here, the first step in
creating an emergency floppy is to use <tt class="command">mkfs</tt> to
create a filesystem on a floppy (see the section "<a href="ch06_01.htm">Section 6.1.4, "Creating Filesystems"</a>" in 

<a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Managing
 Filesystems, Swap,
 and Devices"</a>). You then mount the
floppy and place whatever files on it that you'll need, including
appropriate entries in <em class="filename">/dev</em> (most of which can be
copied from <em class="filename">/dev</em> on your hard drive root
filesystem). You'll also need a boot floppy, which merely contains a
kernel. The kernel should have its root device set to
<em class="filename">/dev/fd0</em>, using <tt class="command">rdev</tt>. This is
covered in the section "<a href="ch05_02.htm">Section 5.2.1, "Using a Boot Floppy"</a>" in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Essential System Management"</a>. You'll also have to
decide if you want the root floppy filesystem loaded into a ramdisk
(which can be set using <tt class="command">rdev</tt> as well). If you have
more than 4 MB of <span class="acronym">RAM</span>, this is a good idea because
it can free up the floppy drive to be used for, say, mounting another
floppy containing additional tools. If you have two floppy drives, you
can do this without using a ramdisk. If you feel that setting up an
emergency floppy is too hard for you now after reading all this, you
might also want to try some of the scripts available that do it for
you. But whatever you do, be sure to try the emergency floppy 
<em class="emphasis">before</em> disaster happens!</p>

<p>At any rate, the best place to start is your installation floppies.
If those floppies don't contain all of the tools you need, create
a filesystem on a separate floppy and place the missing programs on it.
If you load the root filesystem from floppy into a ramdisk, or 
have a second floppy drive, you can mount the other floppy to access
your maintenance tools.</p>

<p>What tools do you need? In the following sections, we'll talk about
common emergencies and how to recover from them; this should
guide you to what programs would be required for
various situations.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">8.6.1. Repairing Filesystems</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1952" />
<a name="INDEX-1953" />
<a name="INDEX-1954" />
As discussed in the section
"<a href="ch06_01.htm">Section 6.1.5, "Checking and Repairing Filesystems"</a>"

in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Managing
 Filesystems, Swap,
 and Devices"</a>, you can use
<tt class="command">fsck</tt> to recover from several kinds of filesystem
corruption.  Most of these filesystem problems are relatively minor, however, and
can be repaired by booting your system in the usual way and running
<tt class="command">fsck</tt> from the hard drive. However, it is usually
better to check and repair your root filesystem while it is
unmounted. In this case, it's easier to run <tt class="command">fsck</tt>
from an emergency floppy.</p>

<p>There are no differences between running <tt class="command">fsck</tt> from floppy and from
the hard drive; the syntax is exactly the same as described earlier
in the chapter. However, remember that <tt class="command">fsck</tt> is usually a frontend
to tools such as <tt class="command">fsck.ext2</tt>. On other systems, you'll need to
use <tt class="command">e2fsck</tt> (for Second Extended Filesystems).</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1955" />
<a name="INDEX-1956" />
It is possible to corrupt a filesystem so that it cannot be mounted. 
This is usually the result of damage to the filesystem's <em class="emphasis">superblock</em>,
which stores information about the filesystem as a whole. If the superblock
is corrupted, the system won't be able to access the filesystem at all,
and any attempt to mount it will fail (probably with an error to the
effect of "can't read superblock").</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1957" />
<a name="INDEX-1958" />
Because of the importance of the superblock, the filesystem keeps backup
copies of it at intervals on the filesystem. Second Extended Filesystems
are divided into "block groups," where each group has, by default, 8192
blocks. Therefore, there are backup copies 
<?troff .ne 10?>
of the superblock at block
offsets 8193, 16385 (that's 8192 &times; 2 + 1), 24577, and so on. 
If you use the <em class="emphasis">ext2</em> filesystem, check that the filesystem has 
8192-block groups with the following command:
 
<blockquote><pre class="code">dumpe2fs <em class="replaceable">device</em> | more</pre></blockquote>


(Of course, this works only when the master superblock is intact.)
This command will print a great deal of information about the 
filesystem, and you should see something like:

<blockquote><pre class="code">Blocks per group:         8192</pre></blockquote>


If another offset is given, use it for computing offsets to the superblock
copies, as mentioned earlier.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1959" />
<a name="INDEX-1960" />
If you can't mount a filesystem because of superblock problems, chances
are that <tt class="command">fsck</tt> (or <tt class="command">e2fsck</tt>) will fail as well. You can tell 
<tt class="command">e2fsck</tt> to use one of the superblock copies, instead, to repair
the filesystem. The command is:
 
<blockquote><pre class="code">e2fsck -f -b <em class="replaceable">offset</em> <em class="replaceable">device</em></pre></blockquote>


where <em class="replaceable">offset</em> is the block offset to a superblock copy; usually,
this is 8193. The <span class="option">-f</span> switch is used to force a check of the filesystem;
when using superblock backups, the filesystem may appear "clean," in
which case no check is needed. <span class="option">-f</span> overrides this. For example, to 
repair the filesystem on <em class="filename">/dev/hda2</em> with a bad superblock, we can say:
<blockquote><pre class="code">e2fsck -f -b 8193 /dev/hda2</pre></blockquote>

Superblock copies save the day. The previous commands can be executed from an emergency floppy system
and will hopefully allow you to mount your filesystems again.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">8.6.2. Accessing Damaged Files</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1964" />
<a name="INDEX-1965" />
<a name="INDEX-1966" />
You might need to access the files on your hard-drive
filesystems when booting from an emergency floppy. In order to do
this, simply use the <tt class="command">mount</tt> command as described in the
section "<a href="ch06_01.htm">Section 6.1.2, "Mounting Filesystems"</a>"

in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Managing
 Filesystems, Swap,
 and Devices"</a>, mounting your filesystems
under a directory such as <em class="filename">/mnt</em>. (This directory must exist
on the root filesystem contained on the floppy.) For example:

<blockquote><pre class="code">mount -t ext2 /dev/hda2 /mnt</pre></blockquote>


will allow us to access the files on the Second Extended filesystem stored
on <em class="filename">/dev/hda2</em> in the directory <em class="filename">/mnt</em>. You can then access the
files directly and even execute programs from your hard-drive filesystems.
For example, if you wish to execute <tt class="command">vi</tt> from the hard drive,
normally found in <em class="filename">/usr/bin/vi</em>, you would use the command:

<blockquote><pre class="code">/mnt/usr/bin/vi <em class="replaceable">filename</em></pre></blockquote>




You could even place subdirectories of <tt class="command">/mnt</tt> on your path to
make this easier.</p>

<p>Be sure to unmount your hard-drive filesystems before rebooting the
system. If your emergency disks don't have the ability to do a clean
shutdown, unmount your filesystems explicitly with <tt class="command">umount</tt>, to be
safe.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1967" />
<a name="INDEX-1968" />
One problem that is easily fixed by doing this is forgetting 
the root password or 
trashing the contents of <em class="filename">/etc/passwd</em>.
In either case, it might be impossible to log in to the system or
<tt class="command">su</tt> to root. 
To repair this problem, boot from your emergency
disks, mount your root filesystem under <em class="filename">/mnt</em>, and edit
<em class="filename">/mnt/etc/passwd</em>. (It might be a good idea to keep a backup copy
of this file somewhere in case you delete it accidentally.)
For example, to clear the root password altogether, change
the entry for root to:
<blockquote><pre class="code">root::0:0:The root of all evil:/:/bin/bash</pre></blockquote>

Now root will have no password; you can reboot the system from
hard drive and use the <tt class="command">passwd</tt> command to reset it.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1969" />
<a name="INDEX-1970" />
<a name="INDEX-1971" />
Another common problem is corrupt links to system shared libraries. 
The shared library images in <em class="filename">/lib</em> are generally accessed through
symbolic links, such as <em class="filename">/lib/libc.so.5</em>, which point to
the actual library, <em class="filename">/lib/libc.so.<em class="replaceable">version</em></em>. If this link
is removed or is pointing to the wrong place, many commands on the 
system won't run. You can fix this problem by mounting your 
hard-drive filesystems and re-linking the library with a command such as:
<blockquote><pre class="code">cd /mnt/lib; ln -sf libc.so.5.4.47 libc.so.5</pre></blockquote>

to force the <em class="filename">libc.so.5</em> link to point to <em class="filename">libc.so.5.4.47</em>.
Remember that symbolic links use the pathname given on the <tt class="command">ln</tt>
command line. For this reason, the command:
<blockquote><pre class="code">ln -sf /mnt/lib/libc.so.5.4.47 /mnt/lib/libc.so.5</pre></blockquote>

won't do the right thing; <em class="filename">libc.so.5</em> will point to 
<em class="filename">/mnt/lib/libc.so.5.4.47</em>. When you boot from the hard drive,
<em class="filename">/mnt/lib</em> can't be accessed, and the library won't be located.
The first command works because the symbolic link points to a file 
in the same directory.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">8.6.3. Restoring Files from Backup</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1972" />
<a name="INDEX-1973" />
<a name="INDEX-1974" />

<a name="INDEX-1976" />
<a name="INDEX-1977" />
<a name="INDEX-1978" />
If you have deleted important system files, it might be necessary to
restore backups while booting from an emergency disk. For this reason,
it's important to be sure your emergency disk has the tools
you need to restore backups; this includes programs such as
<tt class="command">tar</tt> and <tt class="command">gzip</tt>, as well as the drivers necessary to access
the backup device. For instance, if your backups are made using the
floppy tape device driver, be sure that the <em class="filename">ftape</em> module and
<tt class="command">insmod</tt> command are available on your emergency disk. See
the section "<a href="ch07_05.htm">Section 7.5, "Loadable Device Drivers"</a>"

in <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "Upgrading Software and the Kernel"</a>
for more about this.</p>

<p>All that's required to restore backups to your hard-drive filesystems
is to mount those filesystems, as described earlier, and unpack the
contents of the archives over those filesystems (using the appropriate 
<tt class="command">tar</tt> and <tt class="command">gzip</tt> commands, for example; see the section
"<a href="ch08_01.htm">Section 8.1, "Making Backups"</a>") earlier in this chapter. Remember that every time you
restore a backup you will be overwriting other system files;
be sure you're doing everything correctly and not make
the situation worse. With most archiving programs, you can extract
individual files from the archive.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you want to use your original <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> to restore files,
be sure the kernel used on your emergency disks has the drivers
necessary to access the <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> drive. You can then mount the <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span>
(remember the <tt class="command">mount</tt> flags <span class="option">-r -t iso9660</span>) and copy files from
there.</p>

<p>The filesystems on your emergency disks should also contain important
system files; if you have deleted one of these from your system, it's
easy to copy the lost file from the emergency disk to your hard-drive
filesystem.</p>
