<p>In 1992, Digital introduced a 64-bit, superscaler, RISC-based
architecture called the Alpha, winning impressive reviews in the
industry for speed. Linux is an attractive alternative to the official
operating systems shipped with the Alpha. But installation varies from
system to system because the Alpha has evolved rapidly and has been
shipped over the years with a wide variety of hardware and firmware
(startup programs stored in ROM). This appendix is an introduction to
the main issues and tasks in installing Linux, but you will also need
to carefully read the documents for Linux installation and your
hardware, and show a somewhat adventurous willingness to experiment.

<p>A discussion of Alpha systems must cover years of hardware evolution
from the older style UDB system to the current DS and AS series
systems, as well as standard OEM configurations.  Because there are so
many different BIOS configurations and boot options, it's impossible to give detailed installation instructions for every type of
Alpha system. We hope this discussion will be a guide to help
users who are new to the Alpha architecture understand what to do when installing a new system.</p>

<blockquote><h4 class="objtitle">NOTE</h4>
<p>This discussion does not cover VAX, MIPS, AMD, or Intel CPU-based
systems or hardware that share peripheral and packaging technologies
with Alpha-based systems. We will focus only on the installation of Linux
on Alpha systems and components manufactured by Compaq or licensees of
Alpha technology, such as Samsung Semiconductor USA or Mitsubishi
Semiconductor.</p>

In 1992, Digital Equipment Corporation, also known as DEC or Digital,
introduced the Alpha with support for seven hardware platforms, three
operating systems, multiple networking protocols, and multiple
language compilers.</p>

<p>The Alpha constitutes the largest engineering project ever undertaken
by Digital, involving more than 30 engineering groups spread across 10
countries.  It was not the first RISC-based semiconductor that Digital
produced, but it was the first that Digital decided to sell in the
open market.  Digital Semiconductor (DS) was created as an internal
business group to manufacture, sell, and distribute Digital's
semiconductors on the merchant market.</p>

<p>To keep up with demand and evolving semiconductor manufacturing
technology, Digital outsourced manufacturing of the Alpha
semiconductor, which included agreements with Samsung Electronics and
Mitsubishi Electric to manufacturer current and future implementations
of the Alpha semiconductors.  In addition, the agreements granted
Samsung and Mitsubishi licenses to market, sell, and distribute Alpha
semiconductors worldwide and included joint development projects
related to the Alpha semiconductor family.</p>

<p>The relatively small installed base of Alpha systems and the fact
that most existing systems are "development platforms" that allow
tinkering and tuning supported by massive archives of hardware
documentation have encouraged continued development of Alpha chipsets. However, it also
makes it hard for Linux developers to gather the wide range of
systems under one simple installation procedure.</p>

<p>Compaq had its eyes set on having its own enterprise server
architecture and operating system--an alternative to Microsoft
and Intel.  On January 26, 1998, Digital and the Compaq Computer
Corporation announced a $9.6 billion-dollar merger where Digital
became a wholly owned subsidiary of Compaq.  DS came with the
multibillion dollar package, and the name Digital was absorbed into
Compaq as a brand name.</p>

<p>To summarize, Alpha architecture is a superscaler, open-industry
standard, 64-bit, RISC-based architecture that is engineered by Compaq
and manufactured in volume by Samsung, Mitsubishi, and their
subsidiaries.</p>
