<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>

<p>This is a book about Linux, a free implementation of
<?troff \p?> Unix for Intel
386 (or higher), Alpha, SPARC, PowerPC, Motorola 680x0 (m68k), and other personal computer and server
architectures. In this book, we want to show how you can completely
change the way you work with computers by exploring the world of a
powerful and free operating system--one that goes against the
grain of the traditional PC world. Setting up and running a Linux
system can be challenging, rewarding, and a lot of fun; we think that
Linux brings a great deal of excitement back into computing.  We
invite you to dive in, enjoy yourself, and be the first on your block
to know what it means to tweak your dot clocks and
<em class="emphasis">rdev</em> your kernel image.</p>

<p>We aim this book at readers who are inquisitive and creative
enough to delve full-tilt into the world of Linux. Linux represents
something of a rebellion against commercial operating systems, and
many of its users are the kind of people who like living on the edge
of the latest technological trends. Sure, the casual reader can set up
and run a Linux system (or hundreds of them!) without much trouble,
but the purpose of this book is to dig deeper into the system and
bring you completely into the Linux mentality. Rather than gloss over
the messier details, we explain the concepts by which the system
actually works, so that you can troubleshoot problems on your own. By
sharing the accumulated expertise of several Linux experts, we hope to
give you enough confidence so that one day you can call yourself a
true Linux Guru.</p>

<p>This is the third edition of <em class="emphasis">Running Linux</em>.
In this edition, we have completely updated the installation, configuration,
and tutorial information to be up-to-date with the latest Linux software
distributions (including Red Hat, SuSE, and Debian) and many application
packages. The core of the book, however, has not changed much. This was
intentional: in the first two editions we made a great effort to make the book
as robust as possible, even though Linux itself is under constant
development. This philosophy worked remarkably well and has been preserved
in this new, updated edition. We think this book will be of use to you
for a long time to come.</p>

<p>This book concentrates on the version of Linux for the Intel
x86 family of processors (the 386/486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, and
Pentium II/III chips).  We have also included appendices detailing the
installation and basic configuration procedures for several other
architectures, including Alpha, SPARC, m68k, and PowerPC ports of
Linux. However, apart from the basic installation procedures, the rest
of this book, which focuses on using the system, applies to any port
of Linux.</p>

<p>Kalle Dalheimer has joined Matt Welsh and Lar Kaufman as co-authors for
this third edition. Kalle has been active in the Linux community for
some time and was instrumental in the development of KDE (a popular desktop
environment for Linux). Kalle has authored most of the new material in this
edition, and his particular expertise has brought a fresh perspective to the
technical aspects of this book.</p>

In the preface to the first edition, we said that "Linux has the
potential to completely change the face of the PC operating system
world." Looking back, we think it's obvious that this has already
happened. Linux has erupted into the computing mainstream with an
amazing force: it has been covered by every major media channel, has
helped usher in the so-called "Open Source Revolution,"
and is widely claimed as the most viable competitor to Microsoft's
dominance in the operating systems market. Today, most estimates place
the number of Linux users worldwide at over 10 million.  Linux has
matured to the point where many people don't need to know much about
their systems: they can simply install the software and use it. So,
perhaps you will find much of the detailed advice in this volume
superfluous; at the very least, retain it for historical evidence.</p>

<p>In writing this book, we wanted to make Linux a real choice for the
many personal computer users who find themselves trapped within the
limitations of commercial operating systems. Because of the cooperative
nature of the system, certain aspects of Linux can be confusing or
apparently ad hoc. In this book, we've attempted to condense as much
wisdom as possible based on correspondence with thousands of users
worldwide (and far too much time playing with our own Linux systems).
Linux really can change the way you think about computing--this
book will show you how.</p>

<p>The world of Linux has changed a lot between the previous edition of
<em class="emphasis">Running Linux</em> and this one.  But most of these changes have been in
its image rather than its substance: Forbes magazine and the Economist
are excited about the growth of Linux, major computer companies like
IBM, Hewlett Packard, Oracle, and Compaq are supporting Linux in various
ways, and the "open source" model (originally known as free software)
that Linux exemplifies is all over the news.</p>

<p>Linux itself has improved along the way, and the programs you run on
Linux have matured impressively.  Linux can now be used for massive,
mission-critical servers with multiple processors, clusters, and RAID
disk arrays.  Since this is a getting-started book, we don't talk
about those things. Rather, we concentrate on the more introductory
aspects of the system, but we do cover several server-related topics
(specifically, setting up Samba and web servers).</p>

<p>A major new development covered in this third edition is KDE. KDE (and GNOME, a similar project) has
brought a new, modern look-and-feel to the Linux desktop, making the
system poised to conquer the personal productivity computing market
once and for all.</p>

<p>In addition to new sections on KDE and Samba, this edition offers
introductions to PPP and to building Java<img align="absmiddle" src="figs/U2122.gif"> programs on Linux.  Of
course, all the other information has been completely updated as well.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Why People Like Linux</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-377" />
Why on earth would you want to run Linux? Good question. What you have
now works, doesn't it? Windows 98 is a good operating system,
but it has a lot of limitations. Being tailored for low-end home
users, Windows doesn't deliver the performance or flexibility that
many people expect out of a PC operating system. Here are a few
reasons why people are switching to Linux:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><em class="emphasis">It's free.</em></b></dt><dd><p>That is, Linux is a freely redistributable
clone of the Unix operating system (OS).  You can
get Linux free from someone
who has it, from the World Wide Web, or you can buy it at a reasonable price
on <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> from a vendor who has packaged it
(probably with added value), possibly with support services.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">It's popular.</em></b></dt><dd><p> It
runs on inexpensive Pentium Pro, Pentium II, AMD, and Cyrix chips, and
even older 386/486 machines. Linux also runs on personal PCS based on the Intel Pentium architecture, higher-end
workstations based on the SPARC or Alpha architecture, PowerPCs, and
68k-based Macs. Linux supports a broad range of video cards, sound
cards, <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> and disk drives, printers, scanners,
and other devices.</p>

<p>Linux has an enormous user community presence on the World Wide Web,
with many web sites devoted to providing information and discussion
about the system. A growing number of commercial software vendors are
developing applications for Linux, including Corel WordPerfect, the
StarOffice suite from Star Division, and a number of database products
from big names such as Oracle, Informix, and IBM.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">It's powerful.</em></b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-378" />
<a name="INDEX-379" />
<a name="INDEX-380" />
You will be pleased to see how fast the
system runs, even with many processes running and with multiple windows open.  Linux
makes excellent use of the hardware. Many commercial operating systems
(including Windows 98) make little use of the advanced multitasking
capabilities of the Pentium processor. Linux is native to this architecture
and uses them all. A Linux machine with a reasonably fast processor and
a sufficient amount of <span class="acronym">RAM</span> can perform as well, or
better, than Unix workstations costing $10,000 or more.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">It is of good quality, and runs high-quality software
applications.</em></b></dt><dd><p>  
Linux is being developed publicly with hundreds of
programmers and users refining it, but with the individual vision and
focus of its originator, Linus Torvalds.  It incorporates the work of
universities, companies, and individuals in the form of
highly developed compilers, editors, utilities, and scripts that have
been developed over the last quarter century.  Unlike other new
operating systems, Linux already has an enormous base of applications
freely available for your use--from major scientific applications, to
multimedia tools, to games.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">It has full Unix features.</em></b></dt><dd><p>Linux is a true multiuser,
multitasking operating system that supports multiple processors on
some systems.
It uses the X Window System graphical user interface (<span class="acronym">GUI</span>) and
offers several different integrated desktop environments, including KDE and
GNOME.
Full networking support (<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span>,
<span class="acronym">SLIP</span>, <span class="acronym">PPP</span>, and <span class="acronym">UUCP</span>, among others) is
available.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">It's highly compatible with Windows 95/98, Windows NT, and <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>.</em></b></dt><dd><p>You can
install Linux along with other disk partitions that contain Windows 98 or
other operating systems.  Linux can directly access files on
Windows systems
from the floppy or hard drive.  Developers
are working on emulators for both Windows 98 and <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>, so that eventually you can run commercial applications built for Windows under Linux.
Linux does not run under Windows; it is completely independent of
it, but features have been added to allow the separate systems to
work together.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">It is small.</em></b></dt><a name="INDEX-381" /><dd><p>The basic OS will run on 8 MB of system memory,
including a <span class="acronym">GUI</span> and window manager.  A good basic system will fit in 10 to 20 MB of
disk storage.  (If this seems like a lot of disk space, it's because Linux
provides a lot of utilities.)
Linux has even been tuned to run on low-memory embedded systems
(such as those used in network routers or robots), and in hand-held Personal Digital Assistants such as the PalmPilot!</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">It is big.</em></b></dt><dd><p>Some of the larger distributions fill more than 1 GB
of uncompressed disk storage in binary files alone.  (Full source code
is freely available for Linux and is
included in many <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> distributions of the
software.)  The number of
powerful utilities and applications ported to Linux grows constantly.
You could probably fill several gigabytes of hard disk with them, even
without loading up on graphics and audio files. Linux has even been
used to build some of the largest supercomputers in the world by
networking together dozens of PCs, each running Linux, and using them as
one large computer.</p>

<p>Most Linux users can run a complete system in 300 MB or so of disk space.
This includes all the basics, as well as nice extras such as
the X Window System <span class="acronym">GUI</span>, text-processing tools, and
development
utilities such as compilers and libraries. But if you're a real power user,
much more is available.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">It's supported.</em></b></dt><dd><p>The biggest line of support is
the many web sites devoted to Linux (along with thousands of newsgroup
participants), but
you can also contract for support from an independent company or buy
a supported version of Linux from one of its distributors.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="emphasis">It's well-documented.</em></b></dt><a name="INDEX-382" /><a name="INDEX-383" /><a name="INDEX-384" /><a name="INDEX-385" /><a name="INDEX-386" /><dd><p><a name="INDEX-387" />
<a name="INDEX-388" />
There is this book (an
excellent start!), which is also available in French, German, Japanese,
and Chinese. The Linux development community established the Linux
Documentation Project (LDP) early on, which maintains a large amount
of online documentation about the system. The many books, FAQ lists,
and "how-to" documents from the LDP can guide you through almost any
task that needs to be done under Linux. Once you get over a few
installation humps, Linux is more or less like any other Unix system,
so the many general books about Unix use and administration will give
you all the help you need.  Finally, there is the popular press, which
has written hundreds of books on Linux--both introductory and advanced--which have been translated into most major languages around the world.</p></dd>
