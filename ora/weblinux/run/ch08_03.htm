<h2 class="sect1">8.3. Managing System Logs</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-1782" />
<a name="INDEX-1783" />
<a name="INDEX-1784" />
The <tt class="command">syslogd</tt> utility logs various kinds of system 
activity, such as debugging output from <tt class="command">sendmail</tt>
and warnings printed by the kernel. <tt class="command">syslogd</tt> runs as a daemon and
is usually started in one of the <em class="filename">rc</em> files at boot time.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1785" />
<a name="INDEX-1786" />
The file <em class="filename">/etc/syslog.conf</em> is used to control where <tt class="command">syslogd</tt>
records information. Such a file might look like the following:
<blockquote><pre class="code">*.info;*.notice    /var/log/messages 
mail.debug         /var/log/maillog 
*.warn             /var/log/syslog 
kern.emerg         /dev/console</pre></blockquote>

The first field of each line lists the kinds of messages that should
be logged, and the second field lists the location where they should be logged.
The first field is of the format:

<blockquote><pre class="code"><em class="replaceable">facility</em>.<em class="replaceable">level</em> [; <em class="replaceable">facility</em>.<em class="replaceable">level</em> &#133; ]</pre></blockquote>


where <em class="replaceable">facility</em> is the system application or facility generating
the message, and <em class="replaceable">level</em> is the severity of the message.</p>

<p> 
For example, <em class="replaceable">facility</em> can be <tt class="literal">mail</tt> (for the mail daemon),
<tt class="literal">kern</tt> (for the kernel), <tt class="literal">user</tt> (for user programs), or 
<tt class="literal">auth</tt> (for authentication programs such as <tt class="command">login</tt> or <tt class="command">su</tt>). 
An asterisk in this field specifies all facilities.</p>

<p><em class="replaceable">level</em> can be (in increasing severity): <tt class="literal">debug</tt>, <tt class="literal">info</tt>,
<tt class="literal">notice</tt>, <tt class="literal">warning</tt>, <tt class="literal">err</tt>, <tt class="literal">crit</tt>, <tt class="literal">alert</tt>, or
<tt class="literal">emerg</tt>.</p>

<p>In the previous <em class="filename">/etc/syslog.conf</em>, we see that all messages of severity
<tt class="literal">info</tt> and <tt class="literal">notice</tt> are logged to <em class="filename">/var/log/messages</em>, all
<tt class="literal">debug</tt> messages from the mail daemon are logged to <em class="filename">/var/log/maillog</em>,
and all <tt class="literal">warn</tt> messages are logged to <em class="filename">/var/log/syslog</em>. Also, any
<tt class="literal">emerg</tt> warnings from the kernel are sent to the console (which is the
current virtual console, or an <tt class="command">xterm</tt> started with the <span class="option">-C</span> option).</p>

<p>The messages logged by <tt class="command">syslogd</tt> usually include the date,
an indication of what process or facility delivered the message, and the
message itself--all on one line. For example, a kernel error message
indicating a problem with data on an <em class="emphasis">ext2fs</em> filesystem might
appear in the log files as:
<blockquote><pre class="code">Dec  1 21:03:35 loomer kernel: EXT2-fs error (device 3/2): 
  ext2_check_blocks_bit map: Wrong free blocks count in super block, 
  stored = 27202, counted = 27853</pre></blockquote>



Similarly, if an <tt class="command">su</tt> to the root account succeeds,
you might see a log message such as:
<blockquote><pre class="code">Dec 11 15:31:51 loomer su: mdw on /dev/ttyp3</pre></blockquote>

<?troff .ne 10?>
<a name="INDEX-1787" />
<a name="INDEX-1788" />
Log files can be important in tracking down system problems. If
a log file grows too large, you can delete it using <tt class="command">rm</tt>; it will
be recreated when <tt class="command">syslogd</tt> starts up again.</p>

<p>Your system probably comes equipped with a running <tt class="command">syslogd</tt> and an 
<em class="filename">/etc/syslog.conf</em> that does the right thing. However, it's important
to know where your log files are and what programs they represent. If you
need to log many messages (say, debugging messages from the kernel, 
which can be very verbose) you can edit <em class="filename">syslog.conf</em> and tell 
<tt class="command">syslogd</tt> to reread its configuration file with the command:
<blockquote><pre class="code">kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslog.pid`</pre></blockquote>

Note the use of backquotes to obtain the process ID of <tt class="command">syslogd</tt>,
contained in <em class="filename">/var/run/syslog.pid</em>.</p>

<p>Other system logs might be available as well. These include:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><em class="filename">/var/log/wtmp</em></b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-1789" />
<a name="INDEX-1790" />
This file contains binary data indicating the login times and duration
for each user on the system; it is used by the <tt class="command">last</tt> command to
generate a listing of user logins. The output of <tt class="command">last</tt> might look
like:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">mdw      tty3                Sun Dec 11 15:25   still logged in
mdw      tty3                Sun Dec 11 15:24 - 15:25  (00:00)
mdw      tty1                Sun Dec 11 11:46   still logged in
reboot   ~                   Sun Dec 11 06:46</pre></blockquote>

<p>A record is also logged in <em class="filename">/var/log/wtmp</em> when the system is
rebooted.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="filename">/var/run/utmp</em></b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-1791" />
<a name="INDEX-1792" />
<a name="INDEX-1793" />
This is another binary file that contains information on users
currently logged into the system. Commands, such as 
<tt class="command">who</tt>, <tt class="command">w</tt>, and
<tt class="command">finger</tt>, use this file to produce information on
who is logged in. For example, the <tt class="command">w</tt> command might print:
<blockquote><pre class="code">  3:58pm  up  4:12,  5 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.02, 0.00
User     tty       login@  idle   JCPU   PCPU  what
mdw      ttyp3    11:46am    14                -
mdw      ttyp2    11:46am            1         w
mdw      ttyp4    11:46am                      kermit
mdw      ttyp0    11:46am    14                bash</pre></blockquote>




We see the login times for each user (in this case, one user logged in
many times), as well as the command currently being used.  The <tt class="command">w</tt>
manual page describes all of the fields displayed.</p></dd>


<dt><b><em class="filename">/var/log/lastlog</em></b></dt><dd><p> 
<a name="INDEX-1794" />
<a name="INDEX-1795" />
This file is similar to <em class="filename">wtmp</em>, but is used by
different programs (such as <tt class="command">finger</tt>, to determine
when a user was last logged in.)</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>
<img src="figs/bomb.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the format of the <em class="filename">wtmp</em> and <em class="filename">utmp</em> files differs
from system to system. Some programs may be compiled to
expect one format and others another format. For this reason, commands
that use the files may produce confusing or inaccurate 
information--especially if the files become corrupted by a program
that writes information to them in the wrong format.</p>

<p>Logfiles can get quite large, and if you do not have the
<a name="INDEX-1796" />
	  necessary hard disk space, you have to do something about your
	  partitions being filled too fast. Of course, you can delete the
	  log files from time to time, but you may not want to do this,
	  since the log files also contain information that can be
	  valuable in crisis situations.</p>

<p>One option is to copy the log files from time to time to
<a name="INDEX-1797" />
	  another file and compress this file. The log file itself starts
	  at 0 again. Here is a short shell
	  script that does this for the log file
	  <em class="filename">/var/log/messages</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">mv /var/log/messages /var/log/messages-backup
cp /dev/null /var/log/messages

CURDATE=`date +"%m%d%y"`

mv /var/log/messages-backup /var/log/messages-$CURDATE
gzip /var/log/messages-$CURDATE</pre></blockquote>

<p>First, we move the log file to a different name and then
	  truncate the original file to 0 bytes by copying to it from
	  <em class="filename">/dev/null</em>. We do this so that further
	  logging can be done without problems while the next steps are
	  done. Then, we compute a date string for the current date that is 
	  used as a suffix for the filename, rename the backup file, and
	  finally compress it with <tt class="command">gzip.</tt></p>

<p>You might want to run this small script from
	  <tt class="command">cron</tt>, but as it is presented here, it should
	  not be run more than once a day--otherwise the compressed 
	  backup copy will be overwritten, because the filename
	  reflects the date but not the time of day. If you want to run this script
	  more often, you must use additional numbers to distinguish
	  between the various copies.</p>

<p>There are many more improvements that could be made
	  here. For example, you might want to check the size of the
	  log file first and only copy and compress it if this size exceeds 
	  a certain limit.</p>

<p>Even though this is already an improvement, your partition 
	  containing the log files will eventually get filled. You can
	  solve this problem by keeping only a certain number of
	  compressed log files (say, 10) around. When you have created as
	  many log files as you want to have, you delete the oldest,
	  and overwrite it with the next one to be copied. This
<a name="INDEX-1798" />
<a name="INDEX-1799" />
	  principle is also called <em class="emphasis">log
	  rotation</em>. Some distributions have scripts like
	  <tt class="command">savelog</tt> or <tt class="command">logrotate</tt> that
	  can do this automatically.</p>

<p>To finish this discussion, it should be noted that most recent
	  distributions like SuSE, Debian, and Red Hat already have built-in
	  <tt class="command">cron</tt> scripts that manage your log files and
	  are much more sophisticated than the small one presented
	  here.</p>
