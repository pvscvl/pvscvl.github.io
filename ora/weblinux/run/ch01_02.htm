Unix is one of the most popular operating systems
worldwide because of its large support base and distribution. It was
originally developed as a multitasking system for minicomputers and
mainframes in the mid-1970s.  It has since grown to become one of
the most widely used operating systems anywhere, despite its sometimes
confusing interface and lack of central standardization.</p>

<p>The real reason for Unix's popularity? Many hackers
feel that Unix is the Right Thing--the One
True Operating System. Hence, the development of Linux by an expanding
group of Unix hackers who want to get their hands
dirty with their own system.</p>

<p>Versions of Unix exist for many
systems, ranging from personal computers to supercomputers such
as the Cray <span class="acronym">Y-MP</span>.  Most versions of
Unix for personal computers are quite expensive and
cumbersome. At the time of this writing, a one-machine version of
<span class="acronym">AT&amp;T</span>'s System V for the 386 runs at about $US1500.</p>

Linux is a freely distributable version of Unix,
originally developed by Linus Torvalds, who began work on Linux
in 1991 as a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland.
Linus now works for Transmeta Corporation, a start-up in Santa Clara,
California, and continues to maintain the
Linux <em class="emphasis">kernel</em>, that is, the lowest-level core
component of the operating system.
<a name="INDEX-396" /></p>

<p>Linus released the initial version of Linux for free on the Internet,
inadvertently spawning one of the largest software-development phenomena
of all time. Today, Linux is authored and maintained by a group of several
thousand (if not more) developers loosely collaborating across the Internet.
Companies have sprung up to provide Linux support, to package it into
easy-to-install distributions, and to sell workstations pre-installed with
the Linux software. In March 1999, the first Linux World Expo trade show
was held in San Jose, California, with reportedly well over 12,000
people in attendance.
Most estimates place the number of Linux users worldwide somewhere around
 the 10 million mark (and we expect this number will look small by the time
you read this).</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-397" />

Inspired by Andrew Tanenbaum's Minix operating system (another
free Unix for PCs--albeit a very simple one), Linux began
as a class project in which Linus wanted to build a simple
Unix system that could run on a 386-based PC.
The first
discussions about Linux were on the Usenet newsgroup comp.os.minix. These
<?troff \p?> discussions were
concerned mostly
<?troff .ne 10?> with the development of a small, academic
Unix system for Minix users who wanted more.</p>

<p>The very early development of Linux dealt mostly with the
task-switching features of the 80386 protected-mode interface, all written
in assembly code. Linus writes:</p>


<p>After that it was plain sailing: hairy coding still, but I had some
devices, and debugging was easier.  I started using C at this stage,
and it certainly speeds up development. This is also when I start to
get serious about my megalomaniac ideas to make "a better Minix
than Minix." I was hoping I'd be able to recompile
<tt class="command">gcc</tt> under Linux some day &#133;</p>

<p>Two months for basic setup, but then only slightly longer until I had
a disk driver (seriously buggy, but it happened to work on my machine)
and a small filesystem.  That was about when I made 0.01 available
[around late August of 1991]: it wasn't pretty, it had no floppy
driver, and it couldn't do much anything.  I don't think anybody ever
compiled that version.  But by then I was hooked, and didn't want to
stop until I could chuck out Minix.</p>


<p>No announcement was ever made for Linux Version 0.01. The 0.01 sources
weren't even executable: they contained only the bare rudiments of the
kernel source and assumed that you had access to a Minix machine to
compile and play with them.</p>

<p>On October 5, 1991, Linus announced the first "official"
version of Linux, version 0.02. At this point, Linus was able to run
<tt class="command">bash</tt> (the <span class="acronym">GNU</span> Bourne Again
Shell) and <tt class="command">gcc</tt> (the <span class="acronym">GNU</span> C
compiler), but not much else was working. Again, this was
intended as a hacker's system. The primary focus was kernel
development; none of the issues of user support, documentation,
distribution, and so on had even been addressed. Today, the situation
is quite different--the real excitement in the Linux world
deals with graphical user environments, easy-to-install
distribution packages, and high-level applications such as graphics
utilities and productivity suites.</p>

<p>Linus wrote in comp.os.minix :</p>


<p>Do you pine for the nice days of Minix-1.1, when men were men and
wrote their own device drivers? Are you without a nice project and
just dying to cut your teeth on an OS you can try to modify for your
needs? Are you finding it frustrating when everything works on Minix?
No more all-nighters to get a nifty program working? Then this post
might be just for you.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-399" />
As I mentioned a month ago, I'm working on a free version of a
Minix-lookalike for AT-386 computers.  It has finally reached the
stage where it's even usable (though may not be depending on what you
want), and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution.
It's just version 0.02 &#133; but I've successfully run
<tt class="command">bash</tt>, <tt class="command">gcc</tt>,
<span class="acronym">GNU</span> <tt class="command">make</tt>, <span class="acronym">GNU</span>
<tt class="command">sed</tt>, <tt class="command">compress</tt>, etc. under it.</p>


<p>After Version 0.03, Linus bumped the version number up to 0.10, as
more people started to work on the system. After several further
revisions, Linus increased the version number to 0.95, to reflect his
expectation that the system was ready for an "official"
release very soon. (Generally, software is not assigned the version
number 1.0 until it's theoretically complete or bug-free.) This was in
March 1992. Almost a year and a half later, in late December 1993, the Linux kernel was still at Version
0.99.pl14--asymptotically approaching 1.0. Version 1.0 appeared in March
1994. As of the time of this writing (March 1999), the current kernel
version is 2.2.6, while the 2.3 kernel versions are being concurrently
developed. (We'll explain the Linux versioning conventions in detail
later.)</p>

Linux could not have come into being without the
<span class="acronym">GNU</span> tools created by the Free Software Foundation.
Their <tt class="command">gcc</tt> compiler, which we'll discuss in

<a href="ch13_01.htm">Chapter 13, "Programming
 Languages"</a>, gave life to Linus
Torvalds's code. <span class="acronym">GNU</span>
tools have been intertwined with the development of Linux from the
beginning. Because of the critical contributions of these tools, the
Free Software Foundation even requests that distributions of Linux
with accompanying utilities be called <span class="acronym">GNU</span>/Linux.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-403" />
<a name="INDEX-404" />
Berkeley Unix (<span class="acronym">BSD</span>) has also
played an important role in Linux--not so much in its creation,
but in providing the tools that make it popular.  Most of the
utilities that come with Linux distributions are ported from
<span class="acronym">BSD</span>.  Networking daemons and utilities are
particularly important.  The kernel networking code for Linux was
developed from the ground up (two or three times, in fact), but the
daemons and utilities are vintage <span class="acronym">BSD</span>.</p>

<p>Today, Linux is a complete Unix clone, capable of
running the X Window System, <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span>, Emacs, Web,
mail and news software, you name it. Almost
all major free software packages have been ported to Linux, and
commercial software is becoming available. In fact, many developers
start by writing applications for Linux, and port them to other Unix
systems later. More hardware is
supported than in original versions of the kernel.  Many people have
executed benchmarks on Linux systems and found them to be
faster than workstations from Sun Microsystems and Compaq, and Linux
performs better than or as well as Windows 98 and Windows NT on a wide range of
benchmarks.
Who would have ever guessed that this
"little" Unix clone would have grown up
to take on the entire world of personal and server computing?</p>
