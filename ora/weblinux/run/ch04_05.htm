<h2 class="sect1">4.5. Shells</h2>

<p> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <a name="INDEX-1029" />
As we said before, logging in to the system puts you into a shell (or
a graphical interface if your system is configured to use a display
manager).  So 
does opening an <tt class="command">xterm</tt> window in X.  The shell interprets and
executes all your commands.  Let's look a bit at different shells
before we keep going, because they're going to affect some of the
material coming up.</p>

<p>If it seems confusing that Unix offers many different shells, just
accept it as an effect of evolution.  Believe us, you wouldn't want to
be stuck using the very first shell developed for Unix, the Bourne
shell.  While it was a very powerful user interface for its day (the
mid-1970s), it lacked a lot of useful features for interactive
use--including the ones shown in this section.  So other shells have
been developed over time, and you can now choose the one that best
suits your way of working.</p>

<p>Some of the shells available on Linux are:</p>

<a name="INDEX-1030" /><dl>
<dt><b><tt class="command">bash</tt></b></dt><dd><p>

 
 
Bourne Again shell.  The most commonly used (and most powerful) shell on Linux.
<span class="acronym">POSIX</span>-compliant, compatible with Bourne shell, created and distributed
by the <span class="acronym">GNU</span> project (Free Software Foundation).  Offers command-line
editing, history substitution, and Bourne Shell compatibility.</p>

<a name="INDEX-1031" /></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="command">csh</tt></b></dt><dd><p>
 
 
C shell.  Developed at Berkeley.  Mostly compatible with the Bourne shell for
interactive use, but has a very different interface for programming.
Does not offer command-line editing, although it does have a
sophisticated alternative called history substitution.</p>

<a name="INDEX-1032" /></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="command">ksh</tt></b></dt><dd><p>
 
 
Korn shell.  Perhaps the most popular on Unix systems generally, and
the first to introduce modern shell techniques (including some
borrowed from the C shell) into the Bourne shell.  Compatible with
Bourne shell.  Offers command-line editing.</p>

<a name="INDEX-1033" /></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="command">sh</tt></b></dt><dd><p>
 
 
Bourne shell.  The original shell.  Does not offer command-line
editing.</p>

<a name="INDEX-1034" /></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="command">tcsh</tt></b></dt><dd><p>
 
Enhanced C shell.  Offers command-line editing.</p>

<a name="INDEX-1035" /></dd>


<dt><b><tt class="command">zsh</tt></b></dt><dd><p>
 
 
Z shell.  The newest of the shells.  Compatible with Bourne shell.
Offers command-line editing.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>Try the following command to find out what your shell is.  It
prints out the full pathname where the shell is located.  Don't forget
to type the dollar sign:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>echo $SHELL</b></tt></pre></blockquote>

<p> 
You are probably running <tt class="command">bash</tt>, the Bourne Again Shell.
If you're running
something else, this might be a good time to change to <tt class="command">bash</tt>.
It's powerful, <span class="acronym">POSIX</span>-compliant, well-supported, and very popular on
Linux.  Use the <tt class="command">chsh</tt> command to change your shell:
<a name="INDEX-1036" /></p>

<p> 
<blockquote><pre class="code">$ <tt class="userinput"><b>chsh</b></tt> 
Enter password: <em class="emphasis">Type your password here--this is for security's sake</em> 
Changing the login shell for kalle
Enter the new value, or press return for the default

        Login Shell [/bin/sh]:/bin/bash</pre></blockquote></p>

<p>Before a user can choose a particular shell, that shell must be
	  installed and the system administrator must make it available
	  by entering it in
	  <em class="filename">/etc/shells</em>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to conceptualize the differences between shells.
One is to distinguish Bourne-compatible shells from
<tt class="command">csh</tt>-compatible shells.  This will be of interest to
you when you start to program with the shell, also
known as writing shell scripts.  The Bourne shell and C shell have
different programming constructs.  Most people now agree that
Bourne-compatible shells are better, and there are many
Unix utilities that recognize only the Bourne
shell.</p>

<p>Another way to categorize shells is to identify those that offer command-line
editing (all the newer ones) versus those that do not.  <tt class="command">sh</tt> and
<tt class="command">csh</tt> lack this useful
<?troff \p?> feature.</p>

<p>When you combine the two criteria--being compatible with the Bourne
shell and offering command-line editing--your best choice comes down
to <tt class="command">bash</tt>, <tt class="command">ksh</tt>, or 
<tt class="command">zsh</tt>.  Try out several shells before you make
your choice; it helps to know more than one, in case someday you find yourself
on a system that limits your choice of shells.
