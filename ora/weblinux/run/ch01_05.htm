<h2 class="sect1">1.5. Software Features</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-435" />
In this section, we'll introduce you to many of the software
applications available for Linux and talk about a number of common
computing tasks.  After all, the most important part of the system is
the wide range of software available for it. What's even more
impressive on Linux is that most of this software is freely distributable.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.1. Basic Commands and Utilities</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-436" />
<a name="INDEX-437" />
Virtually every utility you would expect to find on standard
implementations of Unix has been ported to
Linux. This includes basic commands such as <tt class="command">ls</tt>,
<tt class="command">awk</tt>, <tt class="command">tr</tt>, <tt class="command">sed</tt>,
<tt class="command">bc</tt>, <tt class="command">more</tt>, and so on.
There are Linux ports of many popular software packages including Perl,
Python, the Java Development Kit, and more. You name
it--Linux has it.

Therefore, you can expect your familiar working
environment on other Unix systems to be duplicated
on Linux. All of the standard commands and utilities are
there. (Novice Unix users should see
<a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "Basic Unix
 Commands
 and Concepts"</a> for an introduction to these basic
Unix commands.)</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-438" />
<a name="INDEX-439" />
Many text editors are available, including <tt class="command">vi</tt> (as well
as "modern" versions, such as <tt class="command">vim</tt>),
<tt class="command">ex</tt>, <tt class="command">pico</tt>, and
<tt class="command">jove</tt>, as well as <span class="acronym">GNU</span> Emacs and
variants, such as XEmacs (which incorporates extensions for use
under the X Window System) and <tt class="command">joe</tt>. Whatever text
editor you're accustomed to using has more than likely been ported to
Linux.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-440" />
The choice of a text editor is an interesting one. Many
Unix users still use "simple" editors
such as <tt class="command">vi</tt> (in fact, the authors wrote this book
using <tt class="command">vi</tt> and Emacs under Linux). However,
<tt class="command">vi</tt> has many limitations due to its age, and more
<a name="INDEX-441" />
modern (and complex) editors, such as Emacs, are gaining popularity.
Emacs supports a complete <span class="acronym">LISP</span>-based macro language
and interpreter, a powerful command syntax, and other fun-filled
extensions.  Emacs macro packages exist to allow you to read
electronic mail and news, edit the contents of directories, and even
engage in an artificially intelligent psychotherapy session
(indispensable for stressed-out Linux hackers).

In <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Editors, Text Tools,
 Graphics,
 and Printing"</a>, we include a
complete <tt class="command">vi</tt> tutorial and describe Emacs in detail.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-442" />
One interesting note is that most of the basic Linux utilities are
<span class="acronym">GNU</span> software. These <span class="acronym">GNU</span>
utilities support advanced features not found in the standard versions
from <span class="acronym">BSD</span> or <span class="acronym">AT&amp;T</span>. For example,
<span class="acronym">GNU</span>'s version of the <tt class="command">vi</tt> editor,
<tt class="command">elvis</tt>, includes a structured macro language, which
differs from the original <span class="acronym">AT&amp;T</span> version.  However, the
<span class="acronym">GNU</span> utilities strive to remain compatible with
their <span class="acronym">BSD</span> and System V counterparts. Many people
consider the <span class="acronym">GNU</span> versions of these programs
superior to the originals. An example of this are the GNU
<tt class="command">gzip</tt> and <tt class="command">bzip2</tt> file-compression
utilities, which compress data much more efficiently than the original
Unix <tt class="command">compress</tt> utility.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-443" />
<a name="INDEX-444" />
<a name="INDEX-445" />
The most important utility to many users is the
<em class="emphasis">shell</em>. The shell is a program that reads and
executes commands from the user. In addition, many shells provide
features such as <em class="emphasis">job control</em> (allowing the user
to manage several running processes at once--not as Orwellian as
it sounds), input and output redirection, and a command language for
writing <em class="emphasis">shell scripts</em>.
  A shell
script is a file containing a program in the shell command language,
analogous to a "batch file" under
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>.
<a name="INDEX-446" /></p>

<p>There are many types of shells available for Linux. The most important
difference between shells is the command language. For example, the
C shell (<tt class="command">csh</tt>) uses a command language somewhat like
the C programming language. The classic Bourne shell uses
a different command language. One's choice of a shell is often
based on the command language it provides. The shell that you
use defines, to some extent, your working environment under Linux.</p>

<p>No matter what Unix shell you're accustomed to,
some version of it has probably been ported to Linux. The most popular
shell is the <span class="acronym">GNU</span> Bourne Again Shell
(<tt class="command">bash</tt>), a Bourne shell variant.
<tt class="command">bash</tt> includes many
advanced features, such as job control, command history, command and
filename completion, an Emacs-like (or optionally, a <tt class="command">vi</tt>-like)
interface for editing the command
line, and powerful extensions to the standard Bourne shell
language. Another popular shell is <tt class="command">tcsh</tt>, a version
of the C shell with advanced functionality similar to that found in
<tt class="command">bash</tt>.

Other shells include the Korn shell (<tt class="command">ksh</tt>),
<span class="acronym">BSD</span>'s <tt class="command">ash</tt>,
<tt class="command">zsh</tt>, a small Bourne-like shell, and
<tt class="command">rc</tt>, the Plan 9 shell.</p>

<p>What's so important about these basic utilities?  Linux gives you the
unique opportunity to tailor a custom system to your needs. For
example, if you're the only person who uses your system, and you
prefer to use the <tt class="command">vi</tt> editor and the
<tt class="command">bash</tt> shell exclusively, there's no reason to install other
editors or shells.  The "do it yourself"
attitude is prevalent among Linux hackers and users.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.2. Text Processing and Word Processing</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-447" />
<a name="INDEX-448" />
Almost every computer user has a need for some kind of document
preparation system. (How many computer enthusiasts do you know who
still use pen and paper? Not many, we'll wager.)  In the PC world,
<em class="emphasis">word processing</em> is the norm: it involves editing
and manipulating text (often in a
"What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get"
[<span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span>] environment) and producing
printed copies of the text, complete with figures, tables, and other
garnishes.</p>

<p>In the Unix world, <em class="emphasis">text processing</em> is much more common, which is quite different
from the classical concept of word processing.  With a text-processing
system, the author enters text using a "typesetting
language" that describes how the text should be
formatted. Instead of entering the text within a special word
processing environment, the author may modify the source with any text
editor, such as <tt class="command">vi</tt> or Emacs. Once the source text
(in the typesetting language) is complete, the user formats the text
with a separate program, which converts the source to a format
suitable for printing.  This is somewhat analogous to programming in a
language such as C, and "compiling" the document into a
printable form.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-449" />
There are many text-processing systems available for Linux. One is
<tt class="command">groff</tt>, the <span class="acronym">GNU</span> version of the
classic <tt class="command">troff</tt> text formatter originally developed
by Bell Labs and still used on many Unix systems
worldwide.
<a name="INDEX-450" />
Another modern text-processing system is TeX, developed
by Donald Knuth of computer science fame. Dialects of TeX, such as LaTeX,
are also available.</p>

<p>Text processors such as TeX and <tt class="command">groff</tt> differ
mostly in the syntax of their formatting languages.  The choice of one
formatting system over another is also based upon what utilities are
available to satisfy your needs, as well as personal taste.</p>

<p>For example, some people consider the <tt class="command">groff</tt>
formatting language to be a bit obscure, so they use TeX, which is
more readable by humans.  However, <tt class="command">groff</tt> is capable
of producing plain <span class="acronym">ASCII</span> output, viewable on a
terminal, while TeX is intended primarily for output to a printing
device. Still, various programs exist to produce plain
<span class="acronym">ASCII</span> from TeX-formatted documents or to convert
TeX to <tt class="command">groff</tt>, for example.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-451" />
Another text-processing system is Texinfo, an extension to
  TeX used for
software documentation by the Free Software Foundation.  Texinfo is
capable of producing a printed document, or an online-browsable
hypertext "Info" document from a single source file. Info
files are the main format of documentation used by
<span class="acronym">GNU</span> software, such as Emacs.</p>

<p>Text processors are used widely in the computing community for
producing papers, theses, magazine articles, and books. (In fact, this
book was originally written in the LaTeX format, filtered into a home-grown
<span class="acronym">SGML</span> system, and printed from
<em class="emphasis">groff</em>.) The ability to process the
source language as a plain-text file opens the door to many extensions
to the text processor itself. Because source documents are not stored
in an obscure format, readable only by a particular word processor,
programmers are able to write parsers and translators for the
formatting language, thus extending the system.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-452" />
<a name="INDEX-453" />
<a name="INDEX-454" />
What does such a formatting language look like? In general, the
formatting language source consists mostly of the text itself, along
with "control codes" to produce a particular effect, such
as changing fonts, setting margins, creating lists, and so on.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-455" />
The most famous text formatting language is HTML, which now has a
younger cousin in XML; HTML is descended from the SGML in which this book
is maintained. The particular tags used in this book (like &lt;PARA&gt;
and &lt;TITLE&gt;) come from Docbook, a kind of industry-standard set
of tags for marking up technical documentation, which is used in
official Linux documentation (to be discussed later in this chapter).
Here is a typical section beginning in Docbook:</p>

<?troff-ps_indent0?><blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;sect2&gt;&lt;title&gt;Basic Commands and Utilities&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;para&gt;

Virtually every utility you would expect to find on standard
implementations of Unix has been ported to Linux. This
includes basic commands such as &lt;command&gt;ls&lt;/command&gt;,
&lt;command&gt;awk&lt;/command&gt;, &lt;command&gt;tr&lt;/command&gt;,
&lt;command&gt;sed&lt;/command&gt;, &lt;command&gt;bc&lt;/command&gt;,
&lt;command&gt;more&lt;/command&gt;, and so on.  There are Linux ports
of many popular software packages including Perl, Python,
the Java Development Kit, and more. You name it--Linux has
it.  Therefore, you can expect your familiar working
environment on other Unix systems to be duplicated on
Linux. All of the standard commands and utilities are
there.
(Novice Unix users should see
&lt;xref linkend="X-100-3-chap-basic"&gt; for an introduction to
these basic Unix commands.)

&lt;/para&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>At first glance, the typesetting language may appear to be obscure,
but it's actually quite easy to learn. Using a text-processing system
enforces typographical standards when writing. For example, all
enumerated lists within a document will look the same, unless the
author modifies the definition of the enumerated list "environment."</p>

<p>The primary goal of typesetting languages is to allow the author to concentrate on writing the
actual text, instead of worrying about typesetting conventions. When
the example just shown is printed, the commands in
<tt class="literal">&lt;command&gt;</tt> tags will be printed using whatever
font, color, or other convention the publisher has chosen, and a
command index can easily be generated too.  Furthermore, the correct
chapter number and title are plugged in where the strange-looking
<tt class="literal">&lt;xref&amp;&gt;</tt> tag was written, so they are
correct even if the authors reorder the chapters after writing the
paragraph.</p>

<p>While there are WYSIWYG editors for HTML (and even a few for SGML)
getting used to entering tags by hand, like those in the previous
example, actually takes only a little practice. Tools can then generate
output in a standard format like PostScript or PDF and display it on
the author's screen or send it to a printer. Text-processing systems
illustrated in <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Editors, Text Tools,
 Graphics,
 and Printing"</a> include
LaTeX, its close cousin Texinfo, and <tt class="command">troff</tt>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-456" />
<a name="INDEX-457" />
<span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span> word processors are attractive for many reasons;
they provide a powerful,
and sometimes complex, visual interface for editing the
document. However, this interface is inherently limited to those
aspects of text layout that are accessible to the user. For example,
many word processors provide a special "format language"
for producing complicated expressions such as mathematical
formulae. This format language is identical to text processing, albeit on a much smaller
scale.</p>

<p>The subtle benefit of text processing is that the system allows you to
specify exactly what you mean. Also, text processing systems allow you
to edit the source text with any text editor, and the source is easily
converted to other formats.  The tradeoff for this flexibility and
power is the lack of a <span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span> interface.</p>

<p>Many users of word processors are used to seeing the formatted text as
they edit it. On the other hand, when writing with a text processor,
one generally doesn't worry about how the text will appear once it's
formatted.  The writer learns to expect how the text should look from
the formatting commands used in the source.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-458" />
There are programs that allow you to view the formatted document on a
graphics display before printing. One example is the
<tt class="command">xdvi</tt> program, which displays a "device
independent" file generated by the TeX system under the X
Window System. Other software applications, such as
<tt class="command">xfig</tt>, provide a <span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span> graphics
interface for drawing figures and diagrams, which are subsequently
converted to the text-processing language for inclusion in your
document.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-459" />
<a name="INDEX-460" />
There are many other text-processing utilities available. The powerful
<span class="acronym">METAFONT</span> system, used to design fonts for TeX, is included
  with
the Linux port of TeX. Other programs include
<tt class="command">ispell</tt>, an interactive spell checker;
<tt class="command">makeindex</tt>, an index generator for LaTeX
documents; and many <tt class="command">groff</tt> and TeX-based macro
packages for formatting various types of documents and mathematical
texts. Conversion programs are available to translate between TeX or
<tt class="command">groff</tt> source and many other formats.</p>

<p>
In <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Editors, Text Tools,
 Graphics,
 and Printing"</a>, we discuss LaTeX,
<tt class="command">groff</tt>, and other text-formatting tools in detail.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.5.3. Commercial Applications</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-463" />
Commercial software vendors are becoming increasingly interested in
making their products available for Linux. These products include office
productivity suites, word processors, network administration utilities,
and large-scale database engines. In the first two editions of this book,
we couldn't say much about commercial application availability, but
this is rapidly changing--so much so that by the time you read
this, we believe that a host of other commercial application packages
will have been ported to Linux.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-464" />
Star Division (<a href="../../../../../../www.stardivision.com/">http://www.stardivision.com</a>) has released the
Star Office v5.0 office productivity suite for Linux (also available for
Windows 98, Windows NT, and other Unix systems). This suite is more or less a clone of
Microsoft Office, including a word processor, spreadsheet, HTML editor,
presentation manager, and other tools. It is capable of reading file formats
from a wide range of similar applications (including Microsoft Office)
and is available for free download for non-commercial use.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-465" />
<a name="INDEX-466" />
Corel has ported WordPerfect 8 for Linux, which includes a word processor,
spreadsheet, presentation software, personal information manager, and
other applications. It is free for personal use. A single-user license
for non-personal use is $US49.95 if bought from a retailer or
$US69.95 if bought directly from Corel.</p>

<p>Companies such as Oracle, IBM, Informix, Sybase, and Interbase have released (or have
announced plans to release) commercial database engines that have been
ported to Linux. IBM has released a beta Linux version of its DB2
database server,
available for free download from IBM's website
(<a href="../../../../../../www.ibm.com/">http://www.ibm.com</a>).
This beta release does not support clustering or several of the higher-end
features found in other versions of DB2, but it does exploit multiprocessors.
IBM has also announced that it will provide a Linux version of the popular
AFS network filesystem.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-467" />
Caldera has released NetWare for Linux 1.0, allowing Linux servers to
host NetWare file, print, and directory services, and share data with
Novell NetWare-based servers. It's compatible with NetWare 4.10b and
NetWare clients for Windows 3.1/95/98, DOS, Linux, Macintosh, and UnixWare.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.4. Programming Languages and Utilities</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-468" />
Linux provides a
complete Unix programming environment, including
all of the standard libraries, programming tools, compilers, and
debuggers that you would expect to find on other
Unix systems.  Within the Unix
software development world, applications and systems programming is
usually done in C or C++. The standard C and C++ compiler for Linux is
<a name="INDEX-469" />
<a name="INDEX-470" />
<a name="INDEX-471" />
<span class="acronym">GNU</span>'s <tt class="command">gcc</tt>, which is an advanced,
modern compiler supporting many options.  It's also capable of
compiling C++ (including <span class="acronym">AT&amp;T</span> 3.0 features) as
well as Objective-C, another object-oriented dialect of C.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-472" />
<a name="INDEX-473" />
Java, a relative newcomer on the programming-language scene, is fully
supported under Linux. Sun's Java Development Kit Version 1.2 (also known
as "Java 2") has been ported to Linux and is fully functional.
Java is an object-oriented programming language and runtime environment
that supports a diverse range of applications like web page applets,
Internet-based distributed systems, database connectivity, and more.
Programs written for Java can be run on any system (regardless of CPU
architecture or operating system) that supports the Java Virtual Machine.
There has been a great deal of excitement in the marketplace over the
possibilities presented by Java.</p>

<p>Besides C, C++, and Java,
many other compiled and interpreted programming languages have been
ported to Linux, such as Smalltalk, <span class="acronym">FORTRAN</span>,
Pascal, <span class="acronym">LISP</span>, Scheme, and Ada. In addition, various
assemblers for writing machine code are available, as are
Unix-hacking favorites such as Perl (the script
language to end all script languages), Tcl/Tk (a shell-like
command-processing system that includes support for developing simple
X Window System applications), and Python (the first scripting language to be
designed as object-oriented from the ground up).</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-474" />
The advanced <tt class="command">gdb</tt> debugger has been ported, which
allows you to step through a program to find bugs or examine the cause for a crash
using a core dump. <tt class="command">gprof</tt>, a profiling utility, will
<a name="INDEX-475" />
give you performance statistics for your program, letting you know
where your program is spending most of its time. The Emacs
text editor provides an interactive editing and compilation
environment for various programming languages.  Other tools that have
been ported to Linux include
<span class="acronym">GNU</span> <tt class="command">make</tt> and
<tt class="command">imake</tt>, used to manage compilation of large
applications, and <span class="acronym">RCS</span>, a system for source locking
and revision control.</p>

<p>Linux is ideal for developing Unix applications. It
provides a modern programming environment with all of the bells and whistles.
Professional Unix programmers and system
administrators can use Linux to develop software at home and then
transfer the software to Unix systems at work. This
not only can save a great deal of time and money, but also lets
you work in the comfort of your own home.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a>
Computer science students can use Linux to learn
Unix programming and to explore other aspects of
the system, such as kernel architecture.</p><blockquote>

<a name="FOOTNOTE-10" /><p>[10]The authors use their Linux systems to
develop and test X applications at home, which can then be directly
compiled on workstations elsewhere.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>With Linux, not only do you have access to the complete set of libraries and
programming utilities, but you also have the complete kernel and library
source code at your fingertips.</p>

<p>
Chapters 13 and 14 are devoted to the programming languages and tools
available for Linux.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.5. The X Window System</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-477" />
<a name="INDEX-478" />
The X Window System is the standard graphics interface for
Unix machines. It's a powerful environment
supporting many applications.  Using X, the user can have multiple
terminal windows on the screen at once, each window containing a
different login session. A pointing device, such as
a mouse, is generally used with the X interface.</p>

<p>One of the real strengths of the X Window System is that its
"look and feel" is greatly customizable. It's possible
to emulate the Windows 95/98, Macintosh, and NeXTStep environments under X, as
well as to create totally novel desktop configurations (many Linux users prefer to make
up their own).</p>

<p>Many X-specific applications have been written, such as games,
graphics utilities, programming and documentation tools, and so on.
With Linux and X, your system is a bona fide workstation.  Coupled
with <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> networking, you can even display X
applications running on other machines on your Linux screen, as is
possible with other systems running X.</p>

<p>The X Window System, originally developed at <span class="acronym">MIT</span>, 
is freely distributable. However, many commercial vendors have
distributed proprietary enhancements to the original X software. The
version of X available for Linux is known as XFree86, a port of X11R6
<a name="INDEX-479" />
made freely distributable for PC-based Unix
systems, such as Linux. XFree86 supports a wide range of video
hardware, including <span class="acronym">VGA</span>, Super
<span class="acronym">VGA</span>, and a number of accelerated video
adaptors. XFree86 is a complete distribution of the X software,
containing the X server itself, many applications and utilities,
programming libraries, and documentation.</p>

<p>Standard X applications include <tt class="command">xterm</tt> (a terminal
emulator used for most text-based applications within an X window),
<tt class="command">xdm</tt> (the X Session Manager, which handles logins),
<tt class="command">xclock</tt> (a simple clock display),
<tt class="command">xman</tt> (an X-based manual page reader), and more. The
many X applications available for Linux are too numerous to mention
here, but the base XFree86 distribution includes the
"standard" applications found in the original
<span class="acronym">MIT</span> release. Many others are available separately,
and theoretically any application written for X should compile cleanly
under Linux.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-480" />
The look and feel of the X interface is controlled to a large extent
by the <em class="emphasis">window manager</em>. This friendly program is
in charge of the placement of windows, the user interface for
resizing, iconifying, and moving windows, the appearance of window
frames, and so on. The standard XFree86 distribution includes
<a name="INDEX-481" />
<a name="INDEX-482" />
<tt class="command">twm</tt>, the classic <span class="acronym">MIT</span> window
manager, although more advanced window managers, such as the Open Look
Virtual Window Manager (<tt class="command">olvwm</tt>), are available as
well. One window manager that is popular among Linux users is
<tt class="command">fvwm2</tt>.  This is a small window manager, requiring
less than half of the memory used by <tt class="command">twm</tt>. It
provides a 3D appearance for windows, as well as a virtual
desktop; if the user moves the mouse to the edge of the screen,
the entire desktop is shifted as if the display were much larger than
it actually is. <tt class="command">fvwm2</tt> is greatly customizable and
allows all functions to be accessed from the keyboard as well as from
the mouse. Many Linux distributions use <tt class="command">fvwm2</tt> as the
standard window manager.</p>

<p>The XFree86
distribution contains programming libraries and includes files for
those wily programmers who wish to develop X applications. Various
widget sets, such as Athena, Open Look, and Xaw3D, are supported. All
of the standard fonts, bitmaps, manual pages, and documentation are
included.  <span class="acronym">PEX</span>
(a programming interface for 3D graphics) is also supported, as is
Mesa, a free implementation of the OpenGL 3D graphics primitives.</p>

<p>
In <a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "Installing the X
 Window System"</a> and <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, "Customizing Your X Environment"</a>,
we'll discuss how to install and use the X Window System on your Linux machine.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.5.6. KDE and GNOME</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-483" />
<a name="INDEX-484" />
KDE and GNOME are two new and noteworthy projects generating a lot of
excitement in the Linux world. Both systems intend to produce a
complete integrated graphical desktop environment, running on top of
the X Window System. By building up a powerful suite of development
tools, libraries, and applications that are integrated into the desktop
environment, KDE and GNOME aim to usher in the next era of Linux
desktop computing. Both systems provide a rich GUI,
window manager, utilities, and applications that rival or exceed the
features of systems such as the Windows 98 desktop.</p>

<p>With KDE and GNOME, even casual users and beginners will feel right at
home with Linux. Most distributions automatically configure one of these
desktop environments during installation, making it unnecessary to
ever touch the text-only console interface.</p>

<p>While both KDE and GNOME aim to make the Unix environment more
user-friendly, they have different emphases. KDE's main goals are ease-of-use,
stability, and user-interface compatibility with other computing environments
(such as Windows 95). GNOME, on the other hand, aims more at good looks and
maximum configurability.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.5.7. Networking</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-486" />
<a name="INDEX-487" />
<a name="INDEX-488" />
Linux boasts one of the most powerful and robust networking systems in the
world--so much so that more and more people are finding that Linux
makes an excellent choice as a network server. Linux
supports the two primary networking protocols for
Unix systems: <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> and
<span class="acronym">UUCP</span>.  <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> (Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, for acronym aficionados) is the
set of networking paradigms that allows systems all over the world to
communicate on a single network known as the Internet. With Linux,
<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span>, and a connection to the network, you can
communicate
<?troff .ne 10?> with users and machines across the Internet via the
Web, electronic
mail, Usenet news, file transfers with <span class="acronym">FTP</span>, and
more.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-489" />
Most <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> networks use Ethernet as the physical
network transport.  Linux supports many popular Ethernet cards and
interfaces for personal computers and laptops. Linux also supports
Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, ATM, ISDN, wireless LAN adapters,
Token Ring, packet radio, and a number of high-performance
network interfaces.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-490" />
<a name="INDEX-491" />
<a name="INDEX-492" />
<a name="INDEX-493" />
However, because not everyone has an Ethernet drop at home, Linux also
supports <span class="acronym">PPP</span> and <span class="acronym">SLIP</span>,
allowing you to connect to the Internet via modem. In order for you to use
<span class="acronym">PPP</span> or <span class="acronym">SLIP</span>, your ISP will have
to provide you with an account on their dial-in server,
Many businesses and universities provide dial-in <span class="acronym">PPP</span>
or <span class="acronym">SLIP</span> access. In fact, if your Linux system
has an Ethernet connection as well as a modem, you can configure it as
a <span class="acronym">PPP/SLIP</span> server for other hosts.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-494" />
Linux supports a wide range of web browsers (including
Netscape Navigator, the free Mozilla spin-off, and the text-based
Lynx browser). With a web browser and a Linux machine connected to
the Internet, you can engage in Web surfing, email, chat, news,
and many other web-based services.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-495" />
Linux also hosts a range of web servers (including the popular and free
Apache web server). In fact, it's estimated that Apache running on
Linux systems drives more web sites than any other platform in the
world. Apache is easy to set up and use; we'll show you how in <a href="ch16_01.htm">Chapter 16, "The World Wide Web and
 Electronic Mail"</a>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-496" />
<a name="INDEX-497" />
Samba is a package that allows Linux machines to act as a Windows file
and print server.
<span class="acronym">NFS</span> allows your system to
share files seamlessly with other machines on the network.  With NFS, remote
files look to you as if they were located on your own system's drives.
File Transfer Protocol (<span class="acronym">FTP</span>) allows you to transfer
files to and from other machines on the network.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-498" />
<a name="INDEX-499" />
A full range of mail and news readers are available for Linux, such as
Elm, Pine, <tt class="command">rn</tt>, <tt class="command">nn</tt>, and
<tt class="command">tin</tt>. Whatever your preference, you can configure
your Linux system to send and receive electronic mail and news from
all over the world.</p>

<p>Other networking features include
<span class="acronym">NNTP</span>-based electronic news systems such as C News
and <span class="acronym">INN</span>; the <tt class="command">sendmail</tt>,
<tt class="command">exim</tt> and
<tt class="command">smail</tt> mail transfer agents;
<tt class="command">telnet</tt>, <tt class="command">rlogin</tt>, <tt class="command">ssh</tt>,
and <tt class="command">rsh</tt>, which allow you to log in and execute commands
on other machines on the network; and <tt class="command">finger</tt>, which
allows you to get information on other Internet users. There are tons of
<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span>-based applications and protocols out there.</p>

<p>If you have experience with <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> applications on
other Unix systems, Linux will be familiar to
you. The system provides a standard socket programming interface, so
virtually any program that uses <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> can be
ported to Linux. The Linux X server also supports
<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span>, allowing you to display applications
running on other systems on your Linux display.
Administration of Linux networking will be familiar to those coming from
other Unix systems, as the configuration and monitoring tools are similar
to their <span class="acronym">BSD</span> counterparts.</p>

<p>
In <a href="ch15_01.htm">Chapter 15, "TCP/IP and PPP"</a>, we'll discuss the configuration
and setup of <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span>, including
<span class="acronym">PPP</span>, for Linux. We'll also discuss configuration
of web browsers, web servers, and mail software.
<a name="INDEX-500" /></p>

<p><a name="INDEX-501" />
<span class="acronym">UUCP</span> (Unix to Unix Copy) is an older
mechanism used to transfer files. <span class="acronym">UUCP</span> machines are
connected to each other over phone lines via modem, but
<span class="acronym">UUCP</span> is able to transport over a
<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> network as well. If you do not have access
to a <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> network or a <span class="acronym">PPP</span>
server, you can configure your system to send and receive files and
electronic mail using <span class="acronym">UUCP</span>.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.5.8. Telecommunications and BBS Software</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-503" />
<a name="INDEX-504" />
<a name="INDEX-505" />
<a name="INDEX-506" />
<a name="INDEX-507" />
Telecommunications software under Linux is very similar to
that found under Windows or other operating
systems. Anyone who has used a telecommunications package will find
the Linux equivalent familiar.
If you have a modem, you will be able to communicate with other
machines using one of the telecommunications packages available for
Linux. Many people use telecommunications software to access bulletin
board systems (<span class="acronym">BBS</span>es), as well as commercial
online services. Other people use their modems to connect to a
Unix system at work or school. You can even use
your modem and Linux system to send and receive
facsimiles.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-508" />
One of the most popular communications packages for Linux is Seyon, an
X application providing a customizable, ergonomic interface, with
built-in support for various file-transfer protocols such as Kermit,
Zmodem, and so on. Other telecommunications programs include C-Kermit,

<tt class="command">pcomm</tt>, and <tt class="command">minicom</tt>. These are
similar to communications programs found on other operating systems
and are quite easy to use.
Zmodem for Linux is described in <a href="apph_01.htm">Appendix H, "Zmodem File Transfer"</a>.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-509" />
<a name="INDEX-510" />
If you do not have access to a <span class="acronym">PPP</span> server (see the
previous section), you can use <tt class="command">term</tt> to multiplex
your serial line. <tt class="command">term</tt> allows you to open
  multiple login
sessions over the modem connection to a remote machine.
<tt class="command">term</tt> also allows you to redirect X client
connections to your local X server through the serial line, enabling
you to display remote X applications on your Linux system.  Another
software package, KA9Q, implements a similar
<span class="acronym">SLIP</span>-like interface.</p>

<p>If you do not have access to a <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</span> network or
<span class="acronym">UUCP</span> feed, Linux allows you to communicate
with a number of <span class="acronym">BBS</span> networks, such as Fidonet,
with which you can exchange electronic news and mail via the phone
line.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.5.9. Interfacing with Windows and MS-DOS</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-513" />
<a name="INDEX-514" />
<a name="INDEX-515" />
<a name="INDEX-516" />
<a name="INDEX-517" />
Various utilities exist to interface with the world of Windows 95, Windows
98, and <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>. The most well-known application is
a project known as Wine--a Microsoft Windows emulator for the X
Window System under Linux. The intent of this project, which is still under
development, is to allow Microsoft Windows applications to run directly
under Linux. This is similar to the proprietary <span class="acronym">WABI</span>
Windows emulator
from Sun Microsystems. Wine is in a process of continual development,
and now runs a wide variety of Windows software, including many
desktop applications and several games. See <a href="../../../../../../www.winehq.com/">http://www.winehq.com</a> for details of the
project's progress.</p>

<p>Linux provides a seamless interface for transferring files between
Linux and Windows systems. You can mount a Windows partition or floppy under
Linux, and directly access Windows files as you would any others. In
<a name="INDEX-518" />
<a name="INDEX-519" />
addition, there is the <tt class="command">mtools</tt> package that allows
direct access to <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>-formatted floppies,
as well as <tt class="command">htools</tt>, which does the same for Macintosh
floppy disks.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-520" />
<a name="INDEX-521" />
Another application is the
Linux <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> Emulator, which allows you to run many
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> applications directly from Linux. Although
Linux and <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> are completely different operating
systems, the x86 protected-mode environment allows certain tasks to
behave as if they were running in 8086-emulation mode, as
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> applications do.</p>

<p>The <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> emulator is still under development, yet
many popular applications run under it. Understandably, however,
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> applications that use bizarre or esoteric
features of the system may never be supported, because it's only an
emulator. For example, you wouldn't expect to be able to run any
programs that use x86 protected-mode features, such as Microsoft
Windows (in 386-enhanced mode, that is).</p>

<p>Applications that run successfully under the Linux
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> Emulator include <span class="acronym">4DOS</span> (a
command interpreter), Foxpro 2.0, Harvard Graphics, MathCad,
Turbo Assembler, Turbo C/C++, Turbo Pascal, Microsoft Windows 3.0
(in <em class="emphasis">real</em> mode), and WordPerfect 5.1. Standard
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> commands and utilities, such as
<tt class="command">PKZIP</tt>, work with the emulator as well.</p>

<p>The <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> Emulator is meant mostly as an ad hoc
solution for those people who need <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> only for
a few applications, but use Linux for everything else. It's not meant
to be a complete implementation of <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span>.  Of
course, if the Emulator doesn't satisfy your needs, you can always run
<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> as well as Linux on the
same system (but not at the same time). Using
the LILO boot loader, you can specify which operating
system to start at boot time. Linux can coexist with other operating
systems, such as OS/2, as well.</p>

<p>We'll show you how to use the <span class="acronym">MS-DOS</span> emulator in the section

"<a href="ch12_02.htm">Section 12.2.1, "DOS Emulators: Dosemu and xdos"</a>" in <a href="ch12_01.htm">Chapter 12, "Windows
 Compatibility
 and Samba"</a>, along with other ways to interface
Linux with Windows.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.10. Other Applications</h3>

<p>A host of miscellaneous applications are available for Linux, as one
would expect from such a hodgepodge operating system.  Linux's primary
focus is currently for personal Unix computing, but
this is rapidly changing. Business and scientific
<?troff \p?> software is
expanding,
<?troff .ne 10?> and commercial software vendors are beginning to contribute
to the growing pool of applications.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-523" />
Scientific computing applications
  include <span class="acronym">FELT</span> (a finite element analysis
tool), <tt class="command">gnuplot</tt> (a plotting and data analysis
application), Octave (a symbolic mathematics package, similar to
<span class="acronym">MATLAB</span>), <tt class="command">xspread</tt> (a spreadsheet
calculator), <tt class="command">xfractint</tt> (an X-based port of the
popular Fractint fractal generator), <tt class="command">xlispstat</tt> (a
statistics package), and more. Other applications include Spice (a
circuit design and analysis tool) and Khoros (an image/digital signal
processing and visualization system).</p>

<p>Of course, there are many more such applications that have been, and
can be, ported to run on Linux. Whatever your field, porting
Unix-based applications to Linux should be
straightforward. Linux provides a complete Unix
programming interface, sufficient to serve as the base for any
scientific application.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-524" />
<a name="INDEX-525" />
As with any operating system, Linux has its share of games. These include
classic text-based dungeon games such as Nethack and Moria;
<span class="acronym">MUD</span>s (multiuser dungeons, which allow many users to
interact in a text-based adventure) such as Diku<span class="acronym">MUD</span>
and Tiny<span class="acronym">MUD</span>; and a slew of X games, such as
<tt class="command">xtetris</tt>, <tt class="command">netrek</tt>, and
<tt class="command">Xboard</tt> (the X11 front-end to
<tt class="command">gnuchess</tt>). There has been increasing commercial
interest in graphics-intensive games under Linux, and iD Software has
produced Linux versions of Quake, Quake II,
Quake III, and Doom. A number of other PC game vendors are providing
Linux versions
as well, and many of them admit to developing their software almost
entirely under Linux!</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-526" />
<a name="INDEX-527" />
<a name="INDEX-528" />
<a name="INDEX-529" />
For audiophiles, Linux has support for various sound cards and related
software, such as CDplayer (a program that can control a
<span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> drive as a conventional CD player,
surprisingly enough), <span class="acronym">MIDI</span> sequencers and editors
(allowing you to compose music for playback through a synthesizer or
other <span class="acronym">MIDI</span>-controlled instrument), and sound
editors for digitized sounds.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-530" />
Can't find the application you're looking for? Freshmeat, found on the
Web at <a href="../../../../../../www.freshmeat.net/">http://www.freshmeat.net</a>, is a popular
directory of free software, nearly all of which runs under Linux.
While this directory is far from complete, it contains a great deal
of software. Take a look at it just to see the enormous amount of
code that has been developed for Linux.</p>

<p>If you absolutely can't find what you need, you can always attempt to
port the application from another platform to Linux.
Or, if all else fails, you can write the application yourself.
That's the spirit of Free Software--if you want something to be
done right, do it yourself!</p>
