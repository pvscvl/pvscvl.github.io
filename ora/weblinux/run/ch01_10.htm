<h2 class="sect1">1.10. Sources of Linux Information</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-622" />
As you have probably guessed, there are many sources of information
about Linux available apart from this book.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.10.1. Online Documents</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-623" />
<a name="INDEX-624" />
If you have access to the Internet, you can get many Linux documents
via web and anonymous <span class="acronym">FTP</span> sites all over the
world. If you do not have direct Internet access, these documents may
still be available to you; many Linux distributions on
<span class="acronym">CD-ROM</span> contain all the documents mentioned
here and are often available off the retail shelf. Also, they are distributed
on many other networks, such as Fidonet and CompuServe.</p>

<p>There are a great number of web and <span class="acronym">FTP</span> archive sites that
carry Linux software and related documents.

<a href="appa_01.htm">Appendix A, "Sources of Linux Information"</a> contains a listing of some of the
Linux documents available via the Internet.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-625" />
<a name="INDEX-626" />
Examples of available online documents are the Linux
<span class="acronym">FAQ</span>, a collection of frequently asked questions
about Linux; the Linux <span class="acronym">HOWTO</span> documents, each
describing a specific aspect of the system--including the
Installation <span class="acronym">HOWTO</span>, the Printing
<span class="acronym">HOWTO</span>, and the Ethernet <span class="acronym">HOWTO</span>;
and the Linux <span class="acronym">META-FAQ</span>, a list of other sources of
Linux information on the Internet.</p>

<p>Most of these documents are also posted regularly to one or more
Linux-related Usenet newsgroups; see the section "<a href="ch01_10.htm">Section 1.10.3, "Usenet Newsgroups"</a>" later in this chapter.</p>

<p>The Linux Documentation home page is available to web
users at <a href="../../../../../../www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org</a>. This page contains many <span class="acronym">HOWTO</span>s and other documents, as well as pointers to other sites of
interest to Linux users, including the Linux Documentation Project manuals
(see the following section).</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.10.2. Books and Other Published Works</h3>

<p>The bibliography at the end of this book points you to a wealth of
sources that will help you use your system. There are a
number of published works specifically about Linux.  Most noteworthy
are the books from the Linux Documentation Project (LDP), a project carried
out over the Internet to write and distribute a bona fide set of
"manuals" for Linux. These manuals are analogs to the
documentation sets available with commercial versions of
Unix: they cover everything from installing Linux
to using and running the system, programming, networking, kernel
development, and more.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-627" />
<a name="INDEX-628" />
The Linux Documentation Project manuals are available via the
Web, as well as via mail order
from several sources.

The <a href="biblio.htm">Bibliography</a> lists the manuals that are
available and covers the means of obtaining them in detail.  O'Reilly
&amp; Associates has published the <em class="emphasis">Linux Network
Administrator's Guide</em> from the LDP.</p>

<p>Aside from the growing number of Linux books, there are a
large number of books about Unix in general that
are certainly applicable to Linux--as far as using and
programming the system is concerned, Linux doesn't differ greatly
from other implementations of Unix in most
<?troff .ne 10?>
respects. In fact, this book is meant to be complemented by the large
library of Unix books currently available; here, we
present the most important Linux-specific details and hope you
will look to other sources for more in-depth information.</p>

<p>Armed with a number of good books about using Unix,
as well as the book you hold in your hands, you should be able to
tackle just about anything. The <a href="biblio.htm">Bibliography</a>
includes a list of highly recommended Unix books,
for Unix newcomers and
wizards alike.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-629" />
<a name="INDEX-630" />
There are at least two monthly magazines about Linux:
<em class="emphasis">Linux Journal</em> and <em class="emphasis">Linux Magazine</em>.
These are an excellent way to keep in touch with the many goings-on in the
Linux community.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.10.3. Usenet Newsgroups</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-631" />
<a name="INDEX-632" />
Usenet is a worldwide electronic news and discussion forum with a
heavy contingent of so-called
"newsgroups"--discussion areas devoted to a
particular topic. Much of the development of Linux has been done over
the waves of the Internet and Usenet, and not surprisingly, there are a
number of Usenet newsgroups available for discussions about Linux.</p>

<p>There are far too many newsgroups devoted to Linux to list
here. The ones dealing directly with Linux are under the comp.os.linux.advocacy hierarchy, but
you'll probably find others on related topis like comp.windows.x.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.10.4. Internet Mailing Lists</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-633" />
If you have access to Internet electronic
mail, you can participate in a number of mailing lists even if you do
not have Usenet access.  If you are not directly on the Internet, you
can join one of these mailing lists as long as you are able to
exchange electronic mail with the Internet.  (For example,
<span class="acronym">UUCP</span>, Fidonet, CompuServe, and
other networks all have access to Internet mail.)</p>
