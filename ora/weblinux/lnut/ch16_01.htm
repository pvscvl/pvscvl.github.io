<?troff .Pt "KDE" "" 6 9?>


<p><a name="INDEX-2374" /><a name="INDEX-2375" />KDE, the K Desktop Environment, is an open source software
project that aims at providing a consistent, user-friendly,
contemporary desktop for Unix and Linux systems. KDE is not simply a
window manager like <b class="emphasis-bold">fvwm</b> but a whole desktop
system that integrates the window manager functions into its own
graphical configuration. The KDE interface makes full use of drag-and-drop functionality, so you can grab an icon for a text file in the
file manager and drag it to a text editor window to open it. Full
network integration of KDE applications allows you to transparently
access files from other computers or FTP sites and manipulate them as
if they were local.</p>


<p>KDE also implements a standard help system based on HTML.
Applications that display a Help button can open a specific help file
in the help viewer.</p>


<p>One goal of KDE is to provide the user with system information and
configuration through easy-to-use graphical interfaces of the
desktop. The KDE Control Center is a central utility for desktop and
application configuration, as well as a source of information for
important system components. The Information module of the Control
Center can retrieve and display status information for your
processor, memory, PCI bus, and network devices.</p>


<p>A wide variety of applications have been developed to take advantage
of KDE's features and provide the user with a wealth of
productive applications. The base package comes with programs such as
a mail client, a calendar and organizer, a CD player, image viewers,
chat programs, and many more.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2376" />Most Linux distributions ship with KDE and allow you to set it up as
the default session environment when you install the operating
system. If you are installing KDE separately, download and install
the KDE packages (you can find them at
ftp://ftp.kde.org,among other places).</p>


<p>To set KDE as your desktop environment, look for the X initialization
files in your home directory. Depending on your distribution, look for
either <em class="filename">.xinitrc</em>, <em class="filename">.xsession</em>,
or <em class="filename">.Xclients</em> in your home directory.  If none of
these files exist, create a new <em class="filename">.xinitrc</em>
file. Edit the file to remove any window manager references that may
exist and add <b class="emphasis-bold">startkde</b> on a line at the
end of the file.  Make sure to put the KDE directories in your
path. The default package installation is
<em class="filename">/opt/kde</em>. Note that some distributions will use a
different KDE path, but it will be configured by the default setup.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">16.1. Desktop Overview</h2>


<p><a href="ch16_01.htm">Figure 16-1</a> shows a typical KDE desktop. The bar
across the top edge of the screen is the taskbar. It is used to keep
track of application windows running on the desktop. The panel is at
the bottom of the screen. The panel contains buttons for the main
menu, the window list, and the desktop pager as well as other buttons
used to launch applications.</p>


<a name="ch16-93516" /><div class="figure"><img width="431" src="figs/LX3_1601.gif" height="299" alt="Figure 16-1" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 16-1. The KDE desktop</h4><p><a name="INDEX-2377" />The desktop displays open application windows and contains icons that
can be used to launch applications with a single click. A number of
icons are placed on the desktop by default. There are two folder
icons. One opens the Templates folder, which contains a set of generic
files used to create desktop links. The Autostart folder contains
links to applications that are started automatically every time you
log in. The Trash icon is a link to a special desktop folder to which
you can drag files that you want to delete. There are also icons that
link to mounted CD-ROM and floppy drives.</p>


<a name="ch16-2-appwin" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.1.1. Application Windows</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2378" />Each KDE window has a titlebar with common buttons on the right for
minimize, maximize, and close. On the left side of the titlebar, there
is a small icon (or a dash, if an icon isn't specified by the
application) and a button that looks like a pushpin. The icon opens
the window menu that contains a number of different functions you can
apply to the window, such as sending it to another desktop.  The push
pin button is used to stick or unstick the window to the screen. If
you click on the pushpin, the window will be sticky and appear on all
of the virtual desktops. The button appears pushed in when a window is
sticky. Click the button again to unstick a window.</p>


<p>The window menu contains standard window commands: Maximize, Iconify,
Move, Resize, Sticky, and Close. There is also a command that lets
you send the window to another virtual desktop.</p>
</div>








<a name="ch16-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.1.2. kfm -- the KDE File Manager</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2379" />One of the most important KDE applications is <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b>. <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> is a
graphical file manager and Internet browser and also controls the
workings of the KDE desktop and the icons it contains. Anytime you
click a folder icon, such as the Home folder button on the panel or
the Autostart icon on the desktop, a <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> window opens displaying the contents of the
directory. <a href="ch16_01.htm">Figure 16-2</a> shows a <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> window displaying a home directory. Files and
directories are shown as icons by default, but you can use the View
menu to view contents with more detail.</p>


<a name="ch16-32667" /><div class="figure"><img width="431" src="figs/LX3_1602.gif" height="256" alt="Figure 16-2" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 16-2. kfm, the KDE file manager</h4><p>The <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> interface has its roots in web
browsers.  The toolbar contains back and forward buttons for stepping
through your selection history, a home button, reload, and stop. The
Location bar uses URL addressing for both network addresses and local
filesystems. HTML rendering is well-supported in <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b>, although not as robust as commercial
browsers. If you don't like the bells and whistles of advanced
features such as Java applets and scripting, <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> makes a perfect, simple web browser. You can
even save addresses as bookmarks and use HTTP cookies.</p>


<p>In addition to file management, <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> is
responsible for the functioning of the desktop. When you log into a
KDE session, <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> reads the contents of
the Desktop directory. Any files or folders will be represented as
icon links on the desktop. Items contained in the Autostart folder
will be launched as well. <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> uses text
files ending in <em class="filename">.kdelnk</em> to configure desktop
links. These files are described later.</p>
</div>








<a name="ch16-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.1.3. Adding a Link to the Desktop</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2380" /><a name="INDEX-2381" /><a name="INDEX-2382" /><a name="INDEX-2383" /><a name="INDEX-2384" />There are a couple of ways to add a desktop link. The simplest way is
to right-click on the background and select the New submenu in the
pop-up menu. The New menu offers a number of choices for the type of
link to create: Folder, File System Device, FTP URL, Mime Type,
Application, Internet Address, and WWW URL. When you make a
selection, a default icon for that type will appear on the desktop,
and the properties window will appear for the link.</p>


<p>The properties window varies slightly for the type of link, but for
all links you need to specify a name for the link file, the label for
the icon, and the executable command or file location. You can also
set the permissions for the link file and select a new icon.</p>


<p>The following example shows how to create an application desktop link
that opens the Kedit text editor. First right-click on the desktop
and select New<img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic>Application. A new icon appears on the screen with
the default KDE "gear" graphic and labeled
"Application," and the properties window opens.</p>


<p>The General tab, shown in <a href="ch16_01.htm">Figure 16-3</a>, shows the
default name of the <em class="filename">kdelnk</em> file and other file
information. Change the name of the file to reflect the purpose of
the link; in this example, it is <em class="filename">Kedit.kdelnk</em>.</p>


<a name="ch16-69063" /><div class="figure"><img width="330" src="figs/LX3_1603.gif" height="261" alt="Figure 16-3" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 16-3. General tab of desktop link properties</h4><p>Since you created the link file, the permissions allow you to use it.
If you want to adjust the permissions, go to the Permissions tab. The
next step is to supply the command used to open the application. On
the Execute tab (<a href="ch16_01.htm">Figure 16-4</a>), type in the command,
or click the Browse button to locate the file. Here you can change
the icon for the link by clicking the button showing the current
icon. This opens a window that displays a set of default KDE icons
found on your system. Pick the one you like and click OK.</p>


<a name="ch16-76503" /><div class="figure"><img width="330" src="figs/LX3_1604.gif" height="346" alt="Figure 16-4" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 16-4. Execute tab of desktop link properties</h4><p>The final step is to supply the name for the link and a tooltip
comment. Fill in the Comment box on the Application tab (<a href="ch16_01.htm">Figure 16-5</a>) with a description of the application. Supply
the name of the link (the label that appears under the icon on the
desktop) in the Name box. Click the OK button to finish the
configuration.</p>


<a name="ch16-98577" /><div class="figure"><img width="330" src="figs/LX3_1605.gif" height="346" alt="Figure 16-5" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 16-5. Application tab of desktop link properties</h4><p><a name="INDEX-2385" />For URL or Internet address settings, the properties windows are all
the same except for the default names and icons. These type of links
require you to supply the URL address on the URL tab (<a href="ch16_01.htm">Figure 16-6</a>).</p>


<a name="ch16-89543" /><div class="figure"><img width="330" src="figs/LX3_1606.gif" height="217" alt="Figure 16-6" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 16-6. URL tab of desktop link properties</h4><p>For a new device link, set the link name and permissions if needed.
On the Device tab, supply the location of the device, such as
<em class="filename">/dev/fd3</em> and the mount point. Specify the
filesystem type in the Filesystems box (e.g., default, msdos, etc.).</p>


<p>You can also add a link to the desktop by dragging an item from a file
manager window. You can do this with any file or directory. After you
drag the item to the desktop, a small pop-up window asks you whether
you want to copy, move, or link the item. Copy simply makes a copy of
the item in the Desktop directory. Move will remove the item from its
original location and place it in the Desktop directory. If you
choose link, the desktop icon will contain a symbolic link that
points to the item's current location.</p>
</div>








<a name="ch16-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.1.4. The Desktop Folder and kdelnk Files</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2386" /><a name="INDEX-2387" /><a name="INDEX-2388" /><a name="INDEX-2389" />Everything that is shown on the desktop exists in the
<em class="filename">~/Desktop</em> folder. If you open this folder in the
file manager, you will see directories for Templates and Autostart,
as well as <em class="filename">.kdelnk</em> files for the CD-ROM and
floppy drive and any other links you have set. When KDE starts, it
scans the contents of the Desktop directory and creates icons for
each item.</p>


<p>Desktop links that launch applications, URLs, or files are configured
in the background by <em class="filename">.kdelnk</em> files. These are
simple text files that contain all the information that you set for a
link in the link properties dialog boxes. Although all the
configuration of desktop links is handled thoroughly by the
configuration pop-up windows, the content of
<em class="filename">.kdelnk</em> files may be of interest to advanced
users. The following example shows the <em class="filename">.kdelnk</em>
file for a link to the Kedit text editor:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">    # KDE Config File
    [KDE Desktop Entry]
    Name[]=Kedit
    Exec=kedit
    Type=Application
    Comment[]=Text editor
    BinaryPattern=kedit;Kedit
    Icon=exec.xpm
    TerminalOptions=
    Path=
    Terminal=0
    MimeType=
    SwallowExec=
    SwallowTitle=
    Name[fi]=Sovellus
    Name[hr]=Program
    Name[sl]=Uporabniki program
    Name[pl]=Aplikacja
    ...</pre></blockquote>


<p>As you can see, the syntax is simple and straightforward. The items
filled in on the properties windows are listed on each line of the
file. The Type line identifies the kind of link file. In this example,
Kedit is an application. <tt class="literal">Type=URL</tt> would indicate an
Internet address link file. The <tt class="literal">Name</tt> line lists the
name of the application, <tt class="literal">Exec</tt> lists the command,
<tt class="literal">Icon</tt> identifies the icon image file, and so
on. Unspecified options have empty values. The additional Names lines
are set in the template files and provide alternate names for other
languages should you switch the default language setting for your
environment.</p>
