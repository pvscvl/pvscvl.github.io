<p>In just a few years, Linux has
grown from a student/hacker playground to an upstart challenger in the
server market to a well-respected system taking its rightful place in
educational and corporate networks.  A freely redistributable clone of
the Unix operating system, Linux is turning up everywhere. People use
it for web servers, file servers, and workstations instead of--or
alongside -- systems from traditional Unix vendors as well as
Windows NT.  In addition to its role in large networks (because it's a
friendly fellow that fits in very nicely with other operating
systems), Linux is popular among Windows users who just want to try
something that gives them more speed, more power, and more control.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-21" /><a name="INDEX-22" />The historical impact of Linux goes even beyond its own penetration
into the markets of proprietary operating systems. Its success has
inspired countless other free software or open source (<a href="../../../../../../opensource.org/">http://opensource.org</a>)projects, including
Samba, GNOME, and a mind-boggling collection of innovative projects
that you can browse at numerous sites like SourceForge (<a href="../../../../../../sourceforge.net/">http://sourceforge.net</a>).As both a platform
for other developers and a development model, Linux gave a tremendous
boost to the Free Software Foundation's GNU project, which in turn had
furnished key software that made the development of Linux possible. In
short, Linux is a central participant in the most exciting and
productive free software movement ever seen.</p>


<p>If you haven't obtained Linux yet or have it but don't know exactly
how to get started using it, see <a href="ch00_01.htm">the Preface</a>.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">1.1. The Excitement of Linux</h2>


<p>Linux is first of all free software: anyone can download the source
from the Internet or buy it on a low-cost CD-ROM.  But Linux is
becoming well known because it's more than free software -- it's
unusually good software. You can get more from your hardware with
Linux (particularly on Intel systems, where it was originally developed) and be assured 
<?troff .ne 5?>of fewer crashes; even its security is
better than many commercial alternatives.</p>


<p>As free software, Linux revives the grand creativity and the community
of sharing that Unix was long known for. The unprecedented flexibility
and openness of Unix--which newcomers usually found confusing and
frustrating but which they eventually found they couldn't live
without -- continually inspired extensions, new tools like Perl,
and experiments in computer science that sometimes ended up in
mainstream commercial computer systems.</p>


<p>Many fondly remember the days when AT&amp;T provided universities with
Unix source code at no charge, and the University of Berkeley started
distributing its version in any manner that allowed people to get
it. For these older hackers, Linux can bring back the spirit of
working together -- all the more so because the Internet is now
widespread. And for the many who are too young to remember the first
round of open systems (such as the hordes of students attracted to
Linux) or whose prior experience has been woefully constricted by
proprietary operating systems, now is the time to discover the wonders
of freely distributable source code and infinitely adaptable
interfaces.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-23" />The Linux kernel itself was originally designed by Linus
Torvalds at the University of Helsinki in Finland and later developed
through collaboration with countless volunteers worldwide. By
"kernel," we mean the core of the operating system
itself -- not the applications (such as the compiler, shells, and
so forth) that run on it. Today, the term "Linux" is often used to
mean the kernel as well as the applications and complete system
environment.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-24" />Most Linux systems cannot be technically referred to as a "version of
Unix," as they have not been submitted to the required tests and
licensed properly.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a>However, at least one Linux distribution has in fact been branded as
POSIX.1. Linux offers all the common programming interfaces as standard
Unix systems, and as you can see from this book, all the common Unix
utilities have been reimplemented on Linux. It is a powerful, robust, fully
usable system for those who like Unix.</p><blockquote>


<a name="FOOTNOTE-1" /><p>[1] Before an
operating system can be called "Unix," it must be branded by X/Open.</p>


</blockquote>


<p>The economic power behind Linux's popularity is its support for an
enormous range of hardware used with IBM-compatible personal
computers. People who are accustomed to MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows
are often amazed at how much faster their hardware appears to work
with Linux -- it makes efficient use of its resources.</p>


<p>For the first several years, users were attracted to Linux for a
variety of financial and political reasons, but soon they
discovered an unexpected benefit: it works better than many commercial
systems. With the Samba file and print server, for instance, Linux
serves a large number of end-user PCs without crashing. With the
Apache web server, it provides more of the useful features web
administrators want than competing products do.</p>
