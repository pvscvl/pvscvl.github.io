<h2 class="sect1">1.4. What This Book Offers</h2>


<p>Based originally on the classic O'Reilly &amp; Associates quick
reference, <em class="emphasis">Unix in a Nutshell</em>, this book has been
expanded to include much information that is specific to Linux. The
current edition includes chapters on package managers (which make it
easy to install, update, and remove related software files), on the
KDE and GNOME desktops, and on the <b class="emphasis-bold">fvwm</b> window
manager, as well as new commands and expanded discussions of several
topics such as CVS and <b class="emphasis-bold">bash</b>.</p>


<p><em class="emphasis">Linux in a Nutshell</em> doesn't teach you Linux--it
is, after all, a quick reference -- but novices as well as highly
experienced users will find it of great value. When you have some idea
what command you want but aren't sure just how it works or what
combinations of options give you the exact output required, this book
is the place to turn. It is also an eye-opener: it can make you aware
of options that you never knew about before.</p>


<p>Like computer systems from the age in which Unix was born (the early
1970s), Linux is mostly a command-driven system. Most versions of
Linux provide a few graphical tools, and several commercial products
are available, but none of these graphical utilities are central to
Linux. That is why this book, like the traditional <em class="emphasis">Unix in a
Nutshell</em> reference, focuses on the shell and on commands
you run from the shell.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-33" />Of course, Linux offers a windowing system -- a very rich and
flexible one, as befits a rich and flexible operating system. But a
lot of the time you'll just open a simulated VT100 terminal (the
<b class="emphasis-bold">xterm</b> program) and enter commands into
that. You'll find yourself moving back and forth between graphical
programs and the commands listed in this book.</p>


<p>So the first thing you've got to do, once you're over the hurdle of
installing Linux, is get to know the common utilities run from the
shell prompt. If you know absolutely nothing about Unix, we recommend
you read a basic guide (introductory chapters in the O'Reilly books
<em class="emphasis">Learning Red Hat Linux</em>, <em class="emphasis">Learning Debian
GNU/Linux</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Running Linux</em> can get
you started).  This book offers a context for understanding different
kinds of commands (including commands for programming, system
administration, and network administration) in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "System and Network Administration
 Overview"</a>, followed by the command reference itself in
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Linux Commands"</a>. <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Linux Commands"</a> is
obviously the central focus of the book, containing about one third
its bulk.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-34" /><a name="INDEX-35" />The small chapters immediately following <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Linux Commands"</a> help you get your system set up.  Since most
users do not want to completely abandon other operating systems
(whether a Microsoft Windows system, OS/2, or some Unix flavor), Linux
often resides on the same computer as other systems. The user can boot
the system he needs for a particular job. <a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "Boot Methods"</a>, lists the commonly used booting options on
Intel systems, including LILO (Linux Loader) and Loadlin. <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Red Hat and Debian Package Managers"</a>, covers the Red Hat package
manager (<b class="emphasis-bold">rpm</b>), which is supported by both the Red
Hat and the SuSE distributions, and the Debian package manager
(<b class="emphasis-bold">dpkg</b>). Package managers are crucial for installing
and updating software; they make sure you have all the files you need
in the proper versions.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-36" /><a name="INDEX-37" /><a name="INDEX-38" />All commands are interpreted by the shell. The shell is simply a
program that accepts commands from the user and executes them.
Different shells sometimes use slightly different syntax to mean the
same thing. Under Linux, two popular shells are <b class="emphasis-bold">bash</b> and <b class="emphasis-bold">tcsh</b>,
and they differ in subtle ways. (One of the nice things about Linux,
and other Unix systems is that you have a variety of shells to choose
from, each with strengths and weaknesses.) We offer several chapters
on shells. You may decide to read these after you've used Linux for a
while, because they mostly cover powerful, advanced features that
you'll want when you're a steady user.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-39" /><a name="INDEX-40" /><a name="INDEX-41" /><a name="INDEX-42" />In order to get real work done, you'll have to learn some big,
comprehensive utilities: notably an editor and some scripting
tools. Two major editors are used on Linux: <b class="emphasis-bold">vi</b> and Emacs.  Both have chapters in this book.
Following the editors come two chapters on classic Unix tools for
manipulating text files on a line-by-line basis: <b class="emphasis-bold">sed</b> and <b class="emphasis-bold">gawk</b>
(the GNU version of the traditional <b class="emphasis-bold">awk</b>). O'Reilly also has a separate book about
each of these topics that you may find valuable, because none is
completely intuitive upon first use. (Emacs does have an excellent
built-in tutorial, though; to invoke it, press <b class="emphasis-bold">Ctrl-H</b> followed by <b class="emphasis-bold">t</b> for "tutorial.")</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-43" /><a name="INDEX-44" />CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and RCS (Revision Control
System) manage files so you can retrieve old versions and maintain
different versions simultaneously.  Originally used by programmers who
have complicated requirements for building and maintaining
applications, these tools have turned out to be valuable for anyone
who maintains files of any type, particularly when coordinating a team
of people. CVS is a layer on top of RCS that makes it easier for
multiple people to edit a file simultaneously. <a href="ch14_01.htm">Chapter 14, "CVS and RCS"</a>, presents CVS and RCS commands.</p>


<p>Every distribution of Linux is slightly different, but you'll find
that the commands we document are what you use most of the time and
that they work the same on all distributions. Basic commands,
programming utilities, system administration, and network
administration are all covered here. But some areas were so big that we had to
leave them out. The many applications that depend on the X Window
System didn't make the cut. Nor did TeX (a text-processing tool
used extensively in academia and by Linux users in general), or the
many useful programming languages like Perl, Tcl/Tk, and Python with
which users vastly expand the capabilities of their systems. These
subjects would stretch the book out of its binding.</p>


<p>Our goal in producing this book is to provide convenience, and that
means keeping it small. It certainly doesn't have everything the
manual pages have. But you'll find that it has what you need 95% of
the time.</p>
