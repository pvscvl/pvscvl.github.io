<h2 class="sect1">1.5. Sources and Licenses</h2>


<p><a name="INDEX-45" /><a name="INDEX-46" /><a name="INDEX-47" /><a name="INDEX-48" /><a name="INDEX-49" /><a name="INDEX-50" />When you get Linux, you also get the source code. The same goes for
all the utilities on Linux (unless your vendor offered a commercial
application or library as a special enhancement). You may never bother
looking at the source code, but it's key to Linux's strength.  The
source code has to be provided by the vendor, under the Linux license,
and it permits those who are competent at such things to fix bugs,
provide advice about the system's functioning, and submit improvements
that benefit all of us. The license is the well-known General Public
License, also known as the <em class="emphasis">GPL</em> or
<em class="emphasis">copyleft</em>, invented and popularized by the Free
Software Foundation.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-51" /><a name="INDEX-52" /><a name="INDEX-53" /><a name="INDEX-54" />The FSF, founded by Richard Stallman, is a phenomenon that many people
would believe to be impossible if it did not exist. (The same goes for
Linux, in fact -- 10 years ago, who would have imagined a robust
operating system developed by collaborators over the Internet and made
freely redistributable?) One of the most popular editors on Unix, GNU
Emacs, comes from the FSF. So do <b class="emphasis-bold">gcc</b>
and <b class="emphasis-bold">g++</b> (C and C++ compilers), which
for a while used to set the standard for optimization and fast code.
One of the largest projects within GNU is the GNOME desktop, which
already encompasses several useful general-purpose libraries, window
managers, and applications. The GNOME developers have big plans for
providing an environment that integrates not only the applications on
each user's system but also the services provided throughout a whole
organization.</p>


<p>Dedicated to the sharing of software, the FSF provides all its code
and documentation on the Internet and allows anyone with a whim for
enhancements to alter the source code. One of its projects is the Debian
distribution of Linux.</p>


<p>In order to prevent hoarding, the FSF requires that the source
code for all enhancements be distributed under the same GPL that it
uses.  This encourages individuals or companies to make improvements
and share them with others. The only thing someone cannot do is add
enhancements and then try to sell the product as commercial
software -- that is, to withhold the source code. That would be
taking advantage of the FSF and the users.  You can find the GPL in
any software covered by that license and online at <a href="../../../../../../www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-55" /><a name="INDEX-56" />As we said earlier, many tools on Linux come from BSD instead of GNU.
BSD is also free software. The license is significantly different, but
that doesn't have to concern you as a user. The effect of the
difference is that companies are permitted to incorporate the
software into their proprietary products, a practice that is severely
limited by the GNU license.</p>
