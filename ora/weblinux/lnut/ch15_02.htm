<h2 class="sect1">15.2. The Panel</h2>


<p><a name="INDEX-2245" /><a name="INDEX-2246" /><a name="INDEX-2247" />The GNOME panel can contain several different types of objects.  The
most obvious are the buttons for the menu and application launchers.
You also can use a button to open a drawer, which is like a subpanel
containing additional launchers. There are a few special types of
buttons used for logging out of the session and locking the
screen. Finally, small programs called applets can be run on the
panel. The Desk Guide and the clock are examples of panel applets.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2248" />Settings for the panel are found in the Panel menu on the main menu or
by right-clicking on the panel. This menu offers options to add new
launchers or applets to the panel; adjust the style, size, and display
of the panel; or create new panels on the desktop.</p>


<a name="ch15-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.2.1. Additional Panels</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2249" />You can create more than one panel on your desktop. This is useful if
you have different sets of applications used for specific but common
tasks. For example, if you do a lot of work on graphics, you can
dedicate a panel to launch your favorite graphics tools. To create a
new panel, right-click on the default panel and select Add New Panel.
Or from the main menu, select Panel<img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic>Add New Panel. 
There are five different types of panels available from the submenu:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>edge panel</b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-2250" />The style of the default panel. It stretches across one
entire edge of the screen. Arrow
buttons on each end of the panel are used to collapse the panel to
the side of a screen. Clicking on the remaining visible arrow button
of a collapsed panel will cause the panel to appear again in full.</p></dd>



<dt><b>aligned panel</b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-2251" />A similar panel that is effectively anchored to
one corner of the screen and extends just enough to fit the
buttons and applets it contains. An aligned panel can be hidden by
clicking the arrow button that is at the edge of the screen. The
arrow button farthest from the edge will anchor an aligned panel on the
opposite side of the screen.</p></dd>



<dt><b>sliding panel</b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-2252" />Like an aligned panel except that it can be placed
anywhere along the edge of the screen. It is not anchored to a corner.</p></dd>



<dt><b>floating panel</b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-2253" />As you'd suspect, a panel that can be placed
anywhere on the screen.</p></dd>



<dt><b>menu panel</b></dt><dd><p><a name="INDEX-2254" />A special type of panel that stretches along the top of the screen. It
is a thin bar that contains drop-down menus for the Programs,
Favorites, Settings, and Desktop menus found in the main menu.</p></dd>

</dl>


<p>All of the panels except the menu panel can be moved by middle-clicking
(or clicking the left and right buttons simultaneously) and dragging the panel
to another part of the screen where it can be placed.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2255" /><a name="INDEX-2256" />Each panel can be configured individually from the Panel menu in its
context (right-click) menu. Right-click and select
Panel<img src='figs/U2192.gif' align='absmiddle'></graphic>Properties.  Here you can choose from several different
menu options.  The Type submenu changes the panel's type (although a
menu panel cannot be changed to another type of panel). The Hiding
Policy submenu has settings for Explicit Hide, where you click one of
the arrow buttons to collapse the panel to the side of the screen; or
Auto Hide, where the panel automatically reduces when not in use. The
Hide Buttons submenu allows you to show or hide the arrow and hide
buttons of a panel. The Size submenu sets the size of the panel from
tiny to huge. The Background Type submenu lets you set the background
of a panel to either a color or a pixmap image.</p>


<p>To access all of the panel's properties in one dialog, select All
Properties from this menu. Global property settings are found in the GNOME
Control Center. They are described later in this chapter.</p>

<a name="ch15-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.2.2. Adding an Application Launcher to the Panel</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2257" /><a name="INDEX-2258" /><a name="INDEX-2259" />One of the conveniences of the panel is creating launcher icons that
allow you one-click access to frequently used applications. To add an
application, right-click the panel and select Add New Launcher. You
also can right-click on an application in the main menu and choose
Add This Launcher to Panel.</p>


<p>In each case, the Create Launcher Applet dialog will appear. Provide a
name for the application, a comment to be used as a tooltip, and the
command used to open the application. Click on the icon button to
select the image to be used for the button on the panel. If the
application is to be run in a Terminal, click the Run in Terminal
button.</p>


<p>The drag-and-drop functionality of GNOME allows you to place
applications on the panel in a number of ways. For example, you can
click on an application file in the file manager and drag it to the
panel. This will open the Add New Launcher dialog and create a new
launcher button on the panel. You also can drag a desktop icon to the
panel.</p>


<p>You can configure a launcher's properties by right-clicking it
and selecting Properties. This opens the Launcher Properties window,
where you can change the name, comment, command, application type,
and icon used for the launcher.</p>


<p>Launcher buttons can be placed in any position and order you want on
the panel. To move a launcher button, right-click it and select Move.
The mouse pointer will change, allowing you to drag the button
to another position. Click to set the new position of the button.</p>
