<h2 class="sect1">16.3. The KDE Control Center</h2>


<p><a name="INDEX-2410" /><a name="INDEX-2411" /><a name="INDEX-2412" />The KDE Control Center contains a number of configuration tools,
called <em class="emphasis">modules</em>, that allow you to configure and
view information about your system. You can configure the desktop, the
window manager, input devices, and any other important part of your
system here. The Control Center is split into two windows: the left
window shows a hierarchical list of installed modules, and the right
window displays them when they are selected. (You also have the option
to display each module in its own window. Go to the Options menu and
click the Swallow Modules entry, which is checked by default, to
unselect it.)</p>


<a name="ch16-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.3.1. Applications</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2413" /><a name="INDEX-2414" />The Applications modules set preferences for important KDE components,
such as the login manager, <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b>, and the panel.</p>


<a name="ch16-14-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.3.1.1. Login manager (root only)</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2415" /><a name="INDEX-2416" />The KDE login manager is the program that controls the graphical
login screen. This module lets you configure the graphical style of
the login screen, as well as set some default display options,
such as prelisted users and available session environments.</p>


<p>The Appearance tab lets you edit the greeting string displayed on the
login screen and choose a logo. A drop-down box offers you a choice of the
GUI style of the login screen: either Windows or a Motif style. The
Language option on this tab lets you select the default character
encoding for the login manager.</p>


<p>The Fonts tab lets you choose the font style and size for the
Greeting, Fail, and Standard screen messages. Select which type you
want to configure from the drop-down list and click the Change Font
button. The pop-up window shows a list of available fonts and lets you
set the point size. Click the OK button to close the pop-up window.
The font you have chosen is displayed in the Example area of the tab.</p>


<p>The Background tab lets you select the background for the login
screen. Like the desktop background, you can choose a color or
wallpaper to use.</p>


<p>The Users tab allows you to show a list of users on the login screen.
The users are listed by username with a logo above the login boxes. A
user can simply click her logo to automatically enter her name into
the login box, but she still must supply her password. The tab
contains listings for all users, selected users, and no-show users.
You can select names from the lists and use the arrow buttons to move
them from one box to another. Two options are available for who to
display on the login screen. You can place names in the selected
users list and click the Show Only Selected Users button. 
<?troff .ne 10?>Or, you can edit the all users list and click the Show All Users But
No-Show Users button. No-show users are user IDs that are used to
control access-restricted system resources (e.g., <b class="emphasis-bold">root</b>, <b class="emphasis-bold">news</b>, and
<b class="emphasis-bold">nobody</b>).</p>


<p>The Sessions tab configures session settings. The drop-down list at
the top sets who is allowed to shut down the system. You have the
choices None, All, Root Only, and Console Only. The Commands section
allows you to set the commands used for shutdown and restart. The
Session Types section configures the list of session types that a
user can log into from the login screen. The Default list contains
the various environments that are installed on your system such as
KDE and GNOME. You can add a new type or remove a type from the
listing.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch16-15-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.3.1.2. File manager</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2417" />This module contains configuration settings for <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b>, the KDE file manager and browser. The first
tab contains the font settings. Set the font size used in the file
manager to either small, medium, or large by selecting the
corresponding button. You can set the font styles used for displayed
files or web pages with the Standard Font and Fixed Font settings.
You can also set the character set to use.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2418" /><a name="INDEX-2419" />The Color tab allows you to set the colors used for background, text,
and links. You can set two colors for URL links: one for new links and
one for links that have already been followed (as recorded by the URL
history). There are also settings to change the cursor when it is over
a link, underline links, and override HTML-specified colors with the
default colors set on this tab.</p>


<p>The Other tab allows you to enable URL-specific settings. If you have
set certain properties to view a certain URL or local directory, like
menu bar display or the view settings, you can have them saved for the
next time you visit that URL. The Tree View Follows Navigation button
causes the directory tree in the left pane of the file manager to
match the current open folders in the right pane. The final settings
on this page allow you to select the default programs the file
manager uses for a terminal when you use Open Terminal from the File
Menu and the editor used to view the source of documents.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch16-16-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.3.1.3. Web browser</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2420" /><a name="INDEX-2421" />This module configures settings used for
<b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b>'s web browsing functionality.</p>


<p>If your system is behind a firewall, you may need to use a proxy
server for HTTP and FTP services. The Proxy tabs lets you enable the
use of a proxy and configure it. Check the Use Proxy box, and supply
the hostname or IP address for the proxy server and the port number
to use. Some sites may not work properly when accessing them through
a proxy server. The No Proxy For: box lets you specify a list of
hostnames and domains that will not be accessed via the proxy server.</p>


<p>The HTTP tab sets a few of the parameters sent in HTTP requests by
the browser. The Accept Languages box contains a list of two-letter
abbreviations used to indicate the language that the browser can
accept. The abbreviations, like <em class="filename">en</em> for English
and <em class="filename">fr</em> for French, can be comma-or-space
separated. The order of the list determines the preference of
language. The Accept-Language HTTP request header is configured with
this setting.</p>


<p>The Accept Character Sets box contains a list of character sets that
the browser is capable of receiving. (This sets the Accept-Charset
HTTP request header.) The list can accept the standardized character
set strings, separated by spaces or commas. The Assume HTML button
tells the browser to render as HTML documents whose type is not fully
specified from the server response header.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2422" />The User Agent tab allows you to specify the user-agent string
reported by the browser for sites that may not recognize <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b>, or anything that's not a major commercial
web browser. The user-agent string contains the name and version
number of the client program making the request. The default for
<b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> at the time of this writing is
"Konqueror/1.1.2". To set a different string for a specific server,
type the server name in the On Server box and supply the user-agent
string in the Login As box. Click Add to save this setting. All
settings will be listed in the Known Bindings box. If you want to
remove a setting, select it from the list, and click the Delete
button.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2423" /><a name="INDEX-2424" />The Cookies tab configures how <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> will
manage cookies. Cookies are not used at all unless you check the
Enable Cookies box at the top of the tab. You should set the default
cookie policy to either accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or
prompt for action each time a cookie is received. You can specify the
policy for individual domains as well. Type the domain into the Change
Domain Accept Policy box, and specify Accept, Ask, or Reject for the
policy. Click the Change button, and the setting is saved. You will
see it listed in the Domain Specific Settings list. If you would like
to remove a setting, select it from the list and click the Delete
button.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch16-17-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.3.1.4. Panel</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2425" />The panel configuration module controls the panel, the toolbar,
virtual desktops, and the disk navigator.</p>


<p>The Panel tab contains settings for the location of the panel. You can
choose to place it at the top, bottom, left side, or right side of the
screen by clicking the appropriate radio button. Three settings are
available to set the size of the panel to either Tiny, Normal, or
Large. You also have choices for how the taskbar is displayed. If you
do not want the taskbar to be displayed at all, click the Hidden radio
button. If you want the taskbar displayed fully across the top or
bottom of the screen, click either the Top or Bottom button. If you
choose the Bottom option, the taskbar will appear just above the
panel. Finally, the Top/Left option displays the taskbar at the
top-left corner of your screen, with window buttons stacked on top of
each other.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2426" /><a name="INDEX-2427" /><a name="INDEX-2428" />The Options tab, shown in <a href="ch16_03.htm">Figure 16-7</a>, is divided
into three sections. The Menu Tooltips section contains a button to
enable tooltips to be shown on menu items. You can use
the slider to set the amount of time that the pointer is held over
the item before the tooltip appears. The Visuals section allows you
to set the panel and taskbar to autohide (i.e., disappear when not
being used). Enable these settings by clicking the Auto Hide Panel
and Auto Hide Taskbar buttons. Each option has two slider settings if
autohide is enabled. The Delay slider sets the amount of time after
use (after the pointer has left the panel/taskbar) that the panel
will reduce. The Speed slider sets how fast or slow the panel or
taskbar will open and hide. The Animate Show/Hide setting enables the
panel to use a sliding visual effect when you show or hide it with
its side arrow buttons. The slider sets the speed of this animation.</p>


<a name="ch16-79822" /><div class="figure"><img width="431" src="figs/LX3_1607.gif" height="335" alt="Figure 16-7" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 16-7. Panel options configuration</h4><p>The Options tab contains the following additional settings:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Personal Menu Entries First</b></dt><dd><p>Check this box to display your personal menu section instead of the default system menu at the top of the main menu. The system menus
will be contained in the default submenu.</p></dd>

the hour listing will range from 00 to 24.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Clock Shows Time in Internet Beats</b></dt><dd><p>This option allows you to have the panel clock display the
Swatch-created time format, which divides a day into 1000 beats, in the GMT+1 time zone.</p></dd>

</dl>


<p><a name="INDEX-2429" /><a name="INDEX-2430" />The Desktops tab sets the number of virtual desktops you can divide
your workspace into. The default is 4, and you can use up to 8. The
Visible slider selects the number of desktops (you can choose only
even numbers). The desktops are listed, numbered 1 through 8. If
enabled, the desktop listing has a usable textbox next to it. You can
type in a label for the desktop that will be used in the pager display
on the panel. The Width slider sets the width of the pager buttons
shown on the panel.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2431" />The Disk Navigator tab allows you to configure the disk navigator
shown on the menu and the taskbar. The History section of this tab
has two buttons: Edit Personal and Edit Shared, which allow you to
edit the contents of the Personal and Shared sections of the disk
navigator from the file manager.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2432" /><a name="INDEX-2433" />The Edit Personal button opens <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b> in
the <em class="filename">~/.kde/share/apps/kdisknav</em> directory. This
folder in the user's home directory contains
<em class="filename">kdelnk</em> files for the items displayed in the
Personal section of the disk navigator. The Edit Shared button opens
<em class="filename">/usr/share/apps/kdisknav</em> in <b class="emphasis-bold">kfm</b>, which contains <em class="filename">kdelnk</em>
files for the contents of the Shared section. This directory can be
edited only by <b class="emphasis-bold">root</b>; other users will
have this button disabled.</p>


<p>Additional options set the number of folder entries and file entries
displayed in the Recent section of the disk navigator and the
maximum number of files that can be displayed in a folder.</p>


<p>The Options section of the Disk Navigator tab contains buttons for
the following settings: Show Dot Files (which shows the hidden files that
start with a dot), Show Shared Section, Show Recent Section, Show
Personal Section, Show Option Entry, and Ignore Case When Sorting.
There is also a selection for the default terminal application to
use.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">16.3.2. Desktop</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2437" /><a name="INDEX-2438" />The Desktop modules set preferences for the visual display
of your environment. You can individually set the background,
fonts, or window colors or use the Theme Manager to configure
all of the settings from an installed package.</p>


<a name="ch16-19-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.3.2.1. Background</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2439" />This module sets the desktop background. It allows you to specify a
background for each virtual desktop or just one for all of them.
Select the desktop you want to configure from the list, or check the
Common Background box. You can use colors or a wallpaper image for
your background. The One Color setting applies a solid color to the
background. The Two Color setting lets you choose a blend of two
colors. Select the colors you desire by clicking on the color bars.
The Setup button opens a dialog box for two-color settings. You can
select to blend the colors vertically, horizontally, or with a
pattern.</p>


<p>If you would like to use an image file as wallpaper on the
background, select it from the drop-down list, or click the Browse
button to look for the image on the filesystem. The Arrangement
setting determines how the image file is laid out. You can choose

<h3 class="sect3">16.3.2.2. Borders</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2440" /><a name="INDEX-2441" />This module sets up border properties for windows and the screen.
Active desktop borders enable you to switch between desktops by
moving the mouse pointer to an adjacent screen edge. Check the box to
enable this setting. The Desktop switch-delay slider sets a delay
time for the switch to the adjacent desktop. Set this time to a
comfortable setting that doesn't cause an unwanted desktop
switch every time you move the pointer to the screen edge. Check the
Move Pointer Towards Center After Switch box if you want the pointer
to go to the center of the screen when you switch desktops.</p>


<p>Magic Borders sets up "snap-to" zones around windows and

<h3 class="sect3">16.3.2.7. Theme manager</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2450" /><a name="INDEX-2451" />Themes provide an overall visual style to your desktop, instead of
you having to configure items individually. A theme can determine the
color scheme of windows, the font styles, icons, the background, and
even sound events for your desktop. A couple of themes are installed
by default with KDE, and many more are available for downloading at
<a href="../../../../../../kde.themes.org/">http://kde.themes.org</a>.</p>


<p>TheInstaller tab, shown in <a href="ch16_03.htm">Figure 16-8</a>, lists the
themes you have installed on your system. These include global
themes, which are stored in the
<em class="filename">/share/apps/
<?troff \p?>kthememgr/Themes</em> directory of your
default KDE directory, and local themes, stored in
<em class="filename">~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes</em> in your home
directory. Local themes are themes that are installed or customized
by the user and stored in his home directory. The user is able to
edit and save local themes. Global themes cannot be altered by
individual users.</p>


<a name="ch16-20893" /><div class="figure"><img width="431" src="figs/LX3_1608.gif" height="339" alt="Figure 16-8" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 16-8. Theme Manager installer</h4><p>If you select a theme from the list, a sample desktop image using the
theme is displayed on the tab, with a short text description. If you
would like to apply a new theme, select from the list and click the
Apply button. The selected theme will be copied to the user's
theme manager work directory
(<em class="filename">~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Work</em>).</p>


<p>You can also manage installed themes on the Installer tab. To install
a new theme that you have downloaded, click the Add button. Specify
the filename and location of the theme's
<em class="filename">.tgz</em> file in the pop-up dialog box and click OK. The
Save button lets you save the currently configured theme as local or
save a global theme as local. The Save As button saves the currently
configured theme as a separate local package without altering the
original theme. The Create button works similarly, allowing you to
copy your current working theme as a new local theme package. The
Remove button deletes a local theme or inactivates a global theme.</p>


<p>The Contents tab shows the components that are configured by a theme.
A theme may not have settings available for all the listed
components. If a theme configures a specific component, it is listed
as available. Otherwise, the component is listed as empty. Use the
checkboxes to select which theme components you want to use. If you
choose to not activate a specific component, information on that
component from a previous theme will be used if its information is
still in the theme manager work directory. If you don't want
this to happen, activate the component, even if it is listed as
empty, and default settings will be used.</p>


<p>The About tab shows you author and version information for a selected
theme.</p>

<h3 class="sect3">16.3.2.9. Screensaver</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2454" /><a name="INDEX-2455" />This module sets up your screensaver. A list of available screensavers
is shown with a preview window. If you do not want to use the
screensaver, select No Screensaver from the top of the list.
Otherwise, select the screensaver you want to use. The Setup button
opens a dialog box that contains specific 
<?troff .ne 10?>configuration settings for
each screensaver. For a full-screen test of the screensaver, click the
Test button.</p>


<p>The Settings section allows you to set the amount of time the system
is inactive before the screensaver starts. Type in the number of
minutes in the Wait For box to set this time. If you check the Require
Password box, the user must supply her password before returning to
the desktop. You can also check the box to Show Password as Stars to
display the password text as asterisks, instead of the field being
blank. The Priority control lets you adjust the priority that the
screensaver process has when it is run. If you have lots of important
server activity, for example, set the priority to low so the
performance of other programs will not suffer.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch16-28-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.3.2.10. Style</h3>


<p>The Style module contains a couple of settings for the display of
windows and icons. Draw Widgets in the Style of Windows 95 enables
window components to have a similar look to those used in Windows.
The Menu bar on Top of the Screen in the Style of MacOS setting places
a window's menu bar across the top of screen. Apply Fonts and
Colors to Non-KDE Apps will apply the styles you've chosen to
programs that were not written for KDE.</p>


<p>The Icon Style section allows you to set the size of icons to either
Normal or Large. You can set the size for icons in the following
locations: on the panel, in the file manager and desktop, and at all
other locations.</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2469" /><a name="INDEX-2470" /><a name="INDEX-2471" />You can choose the scheme used for shortcuts by selecting the KDE
defaults or the current scheme if you have customized the shortcuts.
The bottom section of the tab allows you to edit the selected keyboard
shortcut. You can choose no key for the action, the default key, or a
custom key. If you want to customize a key, check the box for the
modifier you want to use (Shift, Ctrl, or Alt), or unselect all of
them if you don't want a modifier. Then click the key button and press
the key on the keyboard that you want to use. Click the Save Changes
button if you want to save the change to the current scheme.</p>

<h3 class="sect3">16.3.7.1. Advanced</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2482" /><a name="INDEX-2483" />The Keyboard and Mouse section of the Advanced tab contains the
following
<?troff \p?>settings:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Ctrl-Tab walks through desktops </b></dt><dd><p>This checkbox sets the Ctrl-Tab key combination to switch through
your virtual desktops. It is checked by default.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Alt-Tab is limited to current desktop</b></dt><dd><p>This checkbox restricts the action of the Alt-Tab key combination to
switch through windows on the current desktop only. It is checked by
default.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Alt-Tab mode</b></dt><dd><p>This setting describes the style of using Alt-Tab to switch through
windows. The KDE setting uses a graphical style. When you press
Alt-Tab, a window appears indicating the current window and other
available windows. The CDE setting switches directly without a graphic.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Grab the Right Mouse Button</b></dt><dd><p>This setting is on by default. It sets the control of the right mouse
button to KDE by default. Some non-KDE applications require control
over the right mouse button. If you need control for these
applications, unselect this setting.</p></dd>

</dl>


<p>The Filters section of the Advanced tab contains settings that let
you customize window styles or functions for application windows
based on their titles or classes. The drop-down box contains a list of
settings that you can define for a filtered window. After the
Windows Will label, you can choose the following
settings:</p>


<ul><li><p>Have tiny decorations</p></li><li><p>Have no decorations</p></li><li><p>Never gain focus</p></li><li><p>Start as sticky</p></li><li><p>Be excluded from session management</p></li></ul><p>Select a setting, then define the window in the next section, which
begins with If They Match the Following. Here you have two boxes,
Titles and Classes. You can define one or both properties.  Put the
title of the application window in the Title box and the application's
class name in the Classes box. (This is usually the capitalized 
<?troff .ne 10?>name
of the application, preceded by an X, for example, XEmacs for an Emacs
window.) You can specify more than one title or class for a window
setting.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch16-40-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.3.7.2. Buttons</h3>


<p>This module configures the layout of buttons that appear on the
titlebars of windows. There are five buttons: minimize (dot), maximize
(square), sticky (pushpin), close (X), and menu (dash or
application-specified icon). Each button has three placement options,
specified by radio buttons: left, right, or off. You can place no more
than three buttons on one side of the titlebar.</p>

<h3 class="sect3">16.3.7.4. Properties</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2486" /><a name="INDEX-2487" />This tab sets windows options and the placement and focus
policy. The Windows section of the tab has three settings:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Vertical maximization only by default</b></dt><dd><p>Check this box to cause the maximize window command to expand a
window only to the full screen height, but leaving its width
unchanged.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Display content in moving windows</b></dt><dd><p>Check this box to enable the display of window contents when the
window is moved.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Display content in resizing window</b></dt><dd><p>Check this box to enable the display of window contents when the
window is resized.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Resize animation</b></dt><dd><p>This slider controls the animation of windows that are maximized or
minimized. Setting the slider all the way to the left (None),
disables animation, and windows will maximize or minimize instantly.
You can set the speed of the animation faster by setting the slider
farther to the right.</p></dd>

</dl>


<?troff .Nd 10?><p><a name="INDEX-2488" />The Placement Policy section of the tab contains a drop-down box with
five options for determining the initial placement of new windows on
the desktop:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Smart (default)</b></dt><dd><p>This setting uses a placement scheme that attempts to keep windows as
uncluttered as possible.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Cascade</b></dt><dd><p>This setting attempts to place windows in a cascaded pattern, with a
set of offset positions available on each desktop.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Interactive</b></dt><dd><p>This setting enables the "allowed overlap"
setting. If a window can be placed on the desktop without overlapping
another by the specified percentage, it will be placed automatically.
If the overlap exceeds the setting, you will be given manual control
of the window placement.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Random</b></dt><dd><p>This setting randomly places a new window on the desktop.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Manual</b></dt><dd><p>This setting opens a window with the mouse pointer activated in move
mode on the titlebar. Move the window to the desired position and
click once to place the window.</p></dd>

</dl>


<p><a name="INDEX-2489" /><a name="INDEX-2490" /><a name="INDEX-2491" />The Focus Policy section sets the policy for giving a window keyboard
focus and an active titlebar. The drop-down box contains four focus
styles. The default is Click to Focus, which gives a window the
keyboard focus and brings it to the foreground only when you click on
it. The remaining settings follow the mouse and activate the Auto
Raise and Click Raise options.</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Click to focus</b></dt><dd><p>The default focus policy requires a mouseclick in a window to give
it focus and raise it (bring it to the foreground). This setting uses
a graphical Alt-Tab style to switch through windows on a desktop.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Focus follows mouse</b></dt><dd><p>This setting causes a window to receive focus when the mouse pointer
enters it. The window will not come to the foreground unless the Auto
Raise button is checked. The window will maintain focus until the
pointer enters another window.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Classic focus follows mouse</b></dt><dd><p>This setting is similar to the Focus Follows Mouse setting, except
that the window loses focus when the mouse pointer moves out of it. If the pointer is not in a window, no window has focus. Also, Alt-Tab
switches directly among windows, without showing the graphical
listing of windows.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Classic sloppy focus</b></dt><dd><p>This setting is similar to Focus Follows Mouse, with focus remaining
in a window even when a mouse pointer leaves it. The only difference
is that the nongraphical Alt-Tab style is used.</p></dd>

</dl>


<p>For any of the nondefault settings, you need to check either the
Auto Raise or Click Raise boxes to be able to raise windows to the
foreground. Click Raise raises a window when you click on it. Auto
Raise raises a window after a short delay, which you can set with the
Delay slider.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch16-43-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">16.3.7.5. Titlebar</h3>


<p>This tab contains many settings for the appearance and action of
window titlebars. The Title Alignment sets the positioning of the
window title in the titlebar to either Left, Middle, or Right.</p>


<p>The Appearance settings adjust the graphical decoration of the
titlebar:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Shaded Vertically</b></dt><dd><p>Uses a two-color background in a top-to-bottom gradient.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Shaded Horizontally</b></dt><dd><p>Uses a two-color background in a left-to-right gradient.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Plain</b></dt><dd><p>Uses a solid color for the background.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Pixmap</b></dt><dd><p>Uses a pixmap image for the titlebar background. This enables the
Pixmap settings, which allow you to choose images for both active and
inactive titlebars. If you don't want the image to appear under
the window title text for better clarity, check the box labeled
No Pixmap Under Text.</p></dd>

</dl>


<p>The checkbox labeled Active Title has Shaded Frame gives a shadowed,
3D appearance to active titlebars.</p>


<p>The Mouse Action options specify the action of double-clicking on a
window titlebar. The available options are (Un)Shade (the default),
(Un)Maximize, Iconify, (Un)Sticky, and Close. The settings identified
with (Un) are toggle settings.</p>


<p>Title animation can be enabled to display a sliding titlebar
animation when a title is too long for the display area. The slider
sets the speed of the back-and-forth motion.<a name="INDEX-2492" /><a name="INDEX-2493" /><a name="INDEX-2494" /><a name="INDEX-2495" /></p>
