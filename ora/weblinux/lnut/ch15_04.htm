most customization and configuration of your desktop environment takes
place. Open the Control Center using the toolbox button on the panel,
or from Utilities on the main menu. The Control Center contains a
number of configuration applications, called
<em class="emphasis">capplets</em>, that allow you to change various GNOME
settings. The capplets are listed in the left pane of the Control
Center window, and clicking on a name opens the capplet in the right
pane.</p>


<a name="ch15-58685" /><div class="figure"><img width="431" src="figs/LX3_1504.gif" height="323" alt="Figure 15-4" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 15-4. GNOME Control Center</h4><a name="ch15-16-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.4.1. Desktop Settings</h3>


<p>These sections provide settings for the overall look of your desktop
by letting you choose the background, screensaver, theme, and window
manager.</p>


<a name="ch15-17-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.1.1. Background</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2276" /><a name="INDEX-2277" />Here's where you set your desktop background.  You can choose to use
an image for wallpaper or colors.  In the wallpaper section, click the
Browse button to select an image file from the filesystem. You can
choose to have the image tiled on the background, centered, or scaled.
In the color section, select to use either a solid, single color, or a
horizontal or vertical gradient of two colors. Click the boxes for
primary color and secondary color to pick the color.</p>


<p>This capplet sets the background via GNOME. Window managers also
can set the background and can sometimes conflict with the
GNOME setting. To ensure that GNOME sets the background, check
the box labeled Use GNOME to Set Background at the bottom
of the window.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch15-18-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.1.2. Screensaver</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2278" /><a name="INDEX-2279" />Contains settings for the screensaver. You can choose from a list of
available screensavers (including a random setting). Input the
number of minutes of inactivity before the screensaver starts and
whether you, the user, will be required to give your password before
going back to the desktop. Power management settings are available
here if your system is configured for them.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch15-19-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.1.3. Theme selector</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2280" /><a name="INDEX-2281" />Themes provide a consistent overall style to the many widgets and
components used by GNOME. A number of basic themes are included with
the <em class="filename">gtk-engines</em> package, and you can download
and install additional themes from
<a href="../../../../../../gtk.themes.org/">http://gtk.themes.org</a>.</p>


<p>Anythemes that are installed on your system are listed in the Theme
Selector. You can select one and
preview it in the lower section of the window. If you click Auto
Preview, a theme will preview automatically when you click on it.
Otherwise, click the Preview button to see how it looks.</p>


<p>If you have downloaded a theme and wish to install it, click the
Install New Theme button. Provide the name and location of the
<em class="filename">.tar.gz</em> or <em class="filename">.tgz </em>file and
click OK. The new theme will be installed in the
<em class="filename">/usr/share/themes</em> directory and be available for
you to use on your desktop.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch15-20-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.1.4. Window manager</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2282" />This section allows you to select the window manager that GNOME
will use and configure its properties if it has a configuration
tool. By default, GNOME runs with the Enlightenment window
manager. Other window managers may be used, but make sure that they
are compliant with the GNOME architecture so as not to create problems
for your applications.</p>


<p>The listing shows installed window managers that you can use. You can
add a new window manager to the list by clicking the Add button. Type
the window manager's name in the dialog box. If it has its own
configuration tool, supply the tool name and location, too. A button
underneath the list will be enabled stating Run the
Configuration Tool for <em class="filename">wm-name</em>. Clicking
this button will open the configuration application for that window
manager.</p>
</div>

<a name="ch15-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.4.2. Panel</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2283" /><a name="INDEX-2284" />Panels can be configured individually or globally. For individual
configuration, right-click on the panel and select This Panel's
Properties.</p>


<p>Most of the panel settings are made in the global panel
configuration tool shown in <a href="ch15_04.htm">Figure 15-5</a>. To open this
tool, select Global Preferences from the Panel menu.</p>


<a name="ch15-72588" /><div class="figure"><img width="431" src="figs/LX3_1505.gif" height="277" alt="Figure 15-5" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 15-5. Panel configuration settings</h4><p>The global panel
configuration section of the Control Center opens. It contains the
following sections:</p>


<a name="ch15-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.2.1. Animation</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2285" /><a name="INDEX-2286" />This tab controls the animated movements of the panel, such as
when the panel is hidden or a drawer is opened. At the top of the tab
is a radio button to enable or disable animation entirely. The rest of
the settings are done with slider bars. The first two sliders to
determine how fast or slow the panel will collapse when it minimizes
under autohide and when you explicitly hide the panel with the arrow
buttons.  The next slider sets the speed of the opening and closing of
drawers. For autohide panels, there are additional sliders for the
amount of time before the panel minimizes and the size (in pixels) of
the hidden panel.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch15-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.2.2. Buttons</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2287" /><a name="INDEX-2288" />This tab controls the look of the various types of buttons on a
panel (See <a href="ch15_04.htm">Figure 15-5</a>).
Select which type of button you want to configure from
the drop-down box.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2289" />Tiles provide a square background for a panel icon instead of the
icon being displayed directly on the panel background.
If you enable tiles (using the radio button at the top), you
can select an image to use for the background of all buttons on the
menu. Tiles also are used to create 3D-style buttons on the panel. You
can choose the images for the up position and the down position
(i.e., on a mouse-down). To select the image files, click the tile
images, and the image file selection dialog opens for you to choose
from.</p>


<p>Two slider controls allow you to set the number of
pixels used for the border width around tiles and the depth of the
icon when pressed.</p>


<p>The following additional settings are available:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Make buttons flush with panel edge</b></dt><dd><p>This setting causes buttons to be placed at
the edges of the panel. There is no visible space between the button
and the desktop background, although there is still spacing between 
panel buttons.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Show button tiles only when cursor is over them</b></dt><dd><p>This setting causes tiles to be unseen until the
mouse pointer is over the
<?troff \p?>button.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Prelight buttons on mouse-over</b></dt><dd><p>This setting causes buttons to "light up" when
the pointer is over them.</p></dd>

</dl>
</div>




<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.2.3. Panel objects</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2290" /><a name="INDEX-2291" />This tab allows you to select among three methods of icon placement:
Switched Movement makes icons switch places with the
icon you are moving. This is the default behavior. Free
Movement locks the current icons in place as you move another
icon. Icons can be moved only to empty areas of the panel when this
method is selected. Push Movement causes moving icons to push the
others around but not move over them.</p>


<p>The Padding slider sets the amount of space (in pixels) separating
objects on the panel.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.2.4. Menu</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2292" /><a name="INDEX-2293" />This tab contains the global menu settings.</p>


<p>The first radio button enables large icons to be used for each menu
item, indicating whether it is a folder, file, or application.</p>


<p>The second radio button, Show ... Buttons, toggles the
cascading display of submenus off and on. If this button is selected,
buttons containing ... are displayed for each menu item
that contains a submenu. The submenu is displayed only when you press
the ... button. Automatic display of cascading menus is
used if this button is <em class="emphasis">not</em> selected.</p>


<p>The Show Pop-Up Menus Outside of Panels button controls
the relative placement of pop-up menus to the panel. If this is
enabled, pop-up menus are displayed on the desktop so that they
don't overlap the panel. The Keep Menus in Memory
button allows you to cache recently opened menus in memory, providing
faster response from your desktop environment.</p>


<p>The remainder of this tab configures which sections of the menu you
want to display. You have a choice of placing the sections directly on
the main menu, placing them in a submenu, or not showing the sections.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch15-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.2.5. Miscellaneous</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2294" />The Miscellaneous tab provides a number of panel configuration
settings:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Tooltips enabled</b></dt><dd><p>Enables tooltips to be displayed for launcher icons.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Close drawer if launcher inside it is pressed</b></dt><dd><p>Causes a drawer to close after one of its items is

<h3 class="sect3">15.4.3.3. URL handlers</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2301" /><a name="INDEX-2302" />This page allows you to adjust the settings for special URL launchers
used by the GNOME help system. The defaults for protocols such as
HTTP, FTP, and Mail are already set and likely handled by your
default web browser (for example, Netscape). The special URLs are
<em class="filename">ghelp</em>, <em class="filename">info</em>, and
<em class="filename">man</em>, corresponding to GNOME help files, command
<em class="filename">info</em> files, and <em class="filename">man</em> files.
The defaults use the help browser for these types of files. It is
best to leave these settings as they are.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.6.1. Startup hint</h3>


<p>The Startup Hint is a program that displays a message every time
you log in. Hints can provide a useful tip for a GNOME function that
the user might not yet know about. You also can use this program to
display a fortune or a message of the day.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.6.2. Startup programs</h3>


<p>Since GNOME is session-aware, applications that are open when you
log off are remembered and reopened the next time you log in. Not all
applications are compliant with the GNOME session state, however. 
If you would like to set up
programs to automatically start at login, you can configure them
here. You can add, edit, or delete startup programs and view the
currently running programs.</p>


<p>At the top of the window, there is an option button to show the splash

<a name="ch15-31-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.4.7. User Interface</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2312" /><a name="INDEX-2313" />This section sets various properties for application window
components such as menus, toolbars, status bars, and dialog boxes.</p>


<a name="ch15-32-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.7.1. Applications</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2314" />The settings available in the applications section control the
behavior of menus, toolbars, and status bars for GNOME applications.</p>


<p>Menu bars in GNOME applications can be detached from windows and
placed anywhere on the desktop. This is the default behavior.</p>


<p>A detachable menu will have a small bar placed on its left edge.
Click on this bar and drag to move the menu bar to another part of
the desktop. To redock the menu bar, drag it back to the titlebar of
its application window, and it will
<?troff \p?>reattach.</p>


<p>For unmovable menu bars, unselect the the radio button labeled
Can Detach and Move Menus.</p>


<p>The same detachable functionality is applied to submenus by default.
To disable this behavior, unselect the radio button labeled
Submenus Can Be Torn Off.</p>


<p>Three settings allow you to display menus, toolbars, and buttons on
toolbars with a relieved border. The relieved border gives a
three-dimensional visual appearance to the components; otherwise,
they appear very flat.</p>


<p>Two options are available for status bars displayed at the bottom of
windows. If a progress meter is used in a status bar, you can
configure it to always appear on the right side of the statusbar. If
this setting is disabled, the application will determine the progress
meter placement.</p>


<p>Some statusbars may have user functionality defined by the
application. You can enable statusbar interactivity with the supplied
setting.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch15-33-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.7.2. Dialogs</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2315" />This page is divided into sections for the look of dialog windows and
the positioning of dialog windows.</p>


<p>The Dialog Layout section allows you to configure the position of
dialog buttons with the following options: Default, Spread Buttons
Out, Put Buttons on Edges, Left-justify Buttons, and Right-justify
Buttons. You also can enable or disable icons for dialog buttons and
choose to use a window's statusbar instead of a dialog, when
possible.</p>


<p>The Dialog Behavior section allows you to set the position of dialog
windows with the following options: Let Window Manager Decide, Center
of the Screen, and At the Mouse Pointer. You also can configure dialog
hints and enable the automatic placement of a dialog over the
application window from which it was launched.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">15.4.8. Sawfish Window Manager Configuration</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2317" /><a name="INDEX-2318" /><a name="INDEX-2319" />The Sawfish window manager is the default window manager
used by the Helix GNOME Desktop used in the figures in this
chapter. Sawfish is GNOME-compliant, working well not to overlap
the GNOME desktop settings. The Helix version of the GNOME Control
Center integrates the Sawfish configuration settings instead of
using a separate configuration tool. The Sawfish section of the
Control Center is shown in <a href="ch15_04.htm">Figure 15-6</a>.</p>


<a name="ch15-fig6" /><div class="figure"><img width="431" src="figs/LX3_1506.gif" height="323" alt="Figure 15-6" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 15-6. Sawfish configuration settings</h4><p>The following sections describe the Sawfish configuration settings
contained in the Helix GNOME Control Center.</p>


<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.8.1. Appearance</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2320" /><a name="INDEX-2321" />This section sets the default appearance of windows, including the style of
the window frame, fonts, and movement style.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2322" />The drop-down box contains a list of frame styles. The frame style
determines how the titlebars of windows are displayed by customizing
the buttons and background of the title.</p>


<p>Some pop-up windows are configured to be displayed without the window
titlebar.  To force the display of the title bar for all windows,
click the button labeled Decorate Transient Windows Similarly to
Top-level Windows.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2323" />The default window animation mode determines the display of windows when
they are being minimized. You can choose from solid or wireframe modes or
None for no animation.</p>


<p>The font button allows you to select the default desktop font. The
default font is set by the GNOME desktop theme and Sawfish is aware of
the setting so that they match.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.8.2. Focus behavior</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2324" /><a name="INDEX-2325" /><a name="INDEX-2326" />This section contains settings that determine how windows receive the
input focus.</p>


<p>The selection box at the top determines how the mouse pointer sets
focus.  The default is to focus when the mouse clicks on the
window. The other choices are to focus only when the pointer is in the
window ("enter-exit") and focus stays with the last window entered
("enter-only").</p>


<p>Three checkboxes are used to enable the following focus policies:
focus each window when first displayed, transient windows inherit
focus from their parent, and raise windows when they are focused.
You can set the delay (in milliseconds) between focus and the time the
window is raised (brought to the foreground).</p>


<p>The advanced section contains the following additional settings:</p>


<ul><li><p>Give focus to windows even when they haven't asked for it.</p></li><li><p>Offset from left window edge when warping.</p></li><li><p>Offset from top window edge when warping.</p></li><li><p>Does click-to-focus mode pass the click through to the window?</p></li></ul><p><a name="INDEX-2327" /><a name="INDEX-2328" />The Shade Hover section contains settings for the behavior of shaded
windows.  A shaded window is effectively rolled up, like a window
shade, into its titlebar, usually by double-clicking on the
titlebar. If you check the button to enable shade hover, a shaded
window will temporarily unshade when the mouse pointer is placed on
its titlebar. The next box allows you to select the delay (in
milliseconds) before unshading occurs. The final setting in this
section enables windows to be raised automatically when they are
unshaded.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.8.3. Minimizing and maximizing</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2329" /><a name="INDEX-2330" />This window contains settings for minimizing and maximizing windows.
The settings for minimizing windows are as follows:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Windows are uniconified onto the current workspace</b></dt><dd><p>Minimized windows are opened on the current desktop workspace
when they are clicked in the tasklist. You will usually have only one
workspace in GNOME, which is divided into a grid of separate screens called
viewports.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Windows are raised after being uniconified</b></dt><dd><p>Minimized windows are opened in the foreground when they are
clicked in the tasklist.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Windows are focused after being uniconified</b></dt><dd><p>Minimized windows receive keyboard focus when they are clicked in the
tasklist.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Iconifying a window that's a member of a group removes the whole group</b></dt><dd><p>If you minimize a window that is part of a group (e.g., an application may
spawn several child windows from the main window), the whole group of windows
will be minimized.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Uniconifying a window that's a member of a group restarts the whole group</b></dt><dd><p>In conjunction with the previous setting, a minimized window group will reopen
if one of its members is raised.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Windows are uniconified to the current viewport</b></dt><dd><p>Minimized windows will reopen in the current screen, regardless of
where they were before. In Sawfish, each screen of a desktop is referred
to as a viewport.</p></dd>

</dl>


<?troff .Nd 10?><p>The settings for maximizing windows are as follows:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Maximizing a window dimension always increases the size of that dimension</b></dt><dd><p>A window maximized vertically or horizontally will increase to that size even
if it fills the screen.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Raise windows when they're maximized</b></dt><dd><p>Maximized windows automatically come to the foreground and receive focus.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Let ignored windows be overlapped when filling windows</b></dt><dd><p>If a window is set to be ignored (via the window menu), it will be overlapped
by a fill command.</p></dd>

<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.8.5. Moving and resizing</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2336" /><a name="INDEX-2337" />The method for drawing windows when they are being moved can be set to
opaque or box. The same options are available for the drawing of
windows being resized.</p>


<p>You also can toggle the following settings:</p>


<ul><li><p>Raise windows being moved or resized interactively.</p></li><li><p>Show the current position while moving windows interactively.</p></li><li><p>Show the current dimensions while resizing windows interactively.</p></li></ul>
</div>




<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.8.6. Placement</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2338" /><a name="INDEX-2339" />This section contains settings for the default placement of new
windows. There are placement policy options for both normal
windows and transient windows. Each setting contains a listbox
with the following options:</p>


<ul><li><p>Randomly (transient default)</p></li><li><p>Interactively</p></li><li><p>Centered</p></li><li><p>Centered-on-parent</p></li><li><p>Under-pointer</p></li><li><p>None</p></li><li><p>First-fit</p></li><li><p>Best-fit (window default)</p></li><li><p>First-fit-or-interactive</p></li></ul><p>If you don't want to allow applications any control over placement,
check the box Ignore Program-specific Window Positions.  This setting
is disabled by default.</p>


<p>For a first-fit or best-fit policy, you can set an amount of space in
pixels to leave between window edges.</p>
</div>




<div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.8.7. Workspaces</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2340" /><a name="INDEX-2341" /><a name="INDEX-2342" /><a name="INDEX-2343" /><a name="INDEX-2344" />Sawfish manages the desktop work area by creating workspaces that can
be divided into a number of different viewable screens, referred to by
the GNOME Desk Guide applet as
<em class="emphasis">viewports</em>. Workspaces can be thought of as
desktops stacked on top of one another. Viewports are configured by a
grid of rows and columns.</p>


<?troff .Nd 10?><p>The first option in this window sets the number of workspaces.
To define the grid of viewports, select the numbers of
columns and rows you want each workspace divided into from the
available settings.</p>


<p>By default, transient (pop-up) windows will be opened in the same
workspace as the window that spawned them.</p>


<p>The Advanced section contains settings for moving
between workspaces. When moving
through workspaces or moving a window, choose the following
options for movement at the ends of workspaces: stop, wrap around, or
keep going.</p>


<p>The easiest way to move among viewports is by using the Desk Guide
applet in the GNOME panel. If you would like to move through screens
when moving the pointer on the screen, you can enable edge flipping.
Two checkbox options set up edge flipping:</p>


<ul><li><p>Flip to next viewport/workspace when pointer hits screen edge.</p></li><li><p>Flip only when interactively moving a window.</p></li></ul><p>You can specify whether edge flipping takes you to the next viewport
(the default) or the next workspace. If you want to set a delay for
edge flipping when the pointer hits the screen edge, input a number in
milliseconds.<a name="INDEX-2345" /></p>

<h3 class="sect2">15.4.9. Configuring the Enlightenment Window Manager</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2346" /><a name="INDEX-2347" />The Enlightenment window manager is the most common window
manager used with GNOME. Configuring the window manager allows you to
adjust the most general behavior of the desktop, such as mouse
behavior, window placement, border styles, and the number of virtual
desktops. You can access the Enlightenment configuration editor from
the GNOME Control Center. Go to the window manager page, select
Enlightenment from the list, and click the Run Configuration Tool for
Enlightenment button. This opens the configuration window shown in
<a href="ch15_04.htm">Figure 15-7</a>.
The Enlightenment configuration tool is composed of the following
sections:</p>


<a name="ch15-24852" /><div class="figure"><img width="431" src="figs/LX3_1507.gif" height="228" alt="Figure 15-7" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 15-7. Enlightenment configuration tool</h4><a name="ch15-36-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">15.4.9.1. Basic options</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2348" /><a name="INDEX-2349" /><a name="INDEX-2350" />The options on this page set styles of window movement and window
focus.</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Move methods</b></dt><dd><p>These buttons select how the window is drawn when it is moved. The
following styles are available: Opaque, Lined, Box, Shaded,
Semi-Solid, and Translucent.</p></dd>



<dt><b>Resize methods</b></dt><dd><p>These buttons select how the window is drawn when it is resized. The
following styles are available: Opaque, Lined, Box, Shaded, and
Semi-Solid.</p></dd>



<?troff .Nd 10?><dt><b>Keyboard focus follows</b></dt><dd><p>These buttons determine how "focus" is selected by the
actions of the mouse. The available settings are Mouse Pointer
(focus follows mouse), Sloppy Pointer (focus follows mouse after a
delay), and Pointer Clicks (focus is given to window on which a mouse
clicks).</p></dd>

<h3 class="sect3">15.4.9.2. Desktops</h3>


<p><a name="INDEX-2351" /><a name="INDEX-2352" />This section configures your desktop space. You can create a number
of virtual desktops, each using its own screen and switch from
one to another as needed. Two sliders allow you to create the column
and row grid of a virtual desktop. Enabling Edge Flip will cause you
to move to the adjacent desktop when the pointer moves across the
edge of the current screen. The delay for the edge flip can be set in
milliseconds. The Separate Desktops setting allows you to set a number
of layered desktops (instead of multiscreen panes). Note that the GNOME
Desk Guide applet does not support layered desktops.</p>
