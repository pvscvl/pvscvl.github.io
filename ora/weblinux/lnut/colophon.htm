<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics, breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>


<p>The animal featured on the cover of 
<em>Linux in a Nutshell</em> is an Arabian horse. Known for its grace and intelligence, the Arabian is one of the oldest breeds of horse, with evidence of its existence dating back 5000 years. The Arabian was very instrumental as an ancestor to other popular breeds, most notably the Thoroughbred in the 17th and 18th centuries. Possibly one of the more characteristic horse breeds, the typical Arabian has large expressive eyes and nostrils, small ears, and a short, sturdy back. Its stamina suits it particularly well for endurance riding, where the breed dominates the sport. Its wonderful temperament makes the Arabian an all-around favorite riding horse in North America, though it also can be found in more specialized competitions such as dressage, jumping, and reining.</p>


<p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using a 19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Emma Colby produced the cover layout using QuarkXPress 4.1 with ITC Garamond font from Adobe. Alicia Cech and David Futato designed the inside layout, based on a series design by Edie Freedman and Nancy Priest. The print version of this book was created by translating the SGML source into a set of gtroff macros using a filter developed at O'Reilly &amp; Associates by Norman Walsh. Steve Talbott designed and wrote the underlying macro set on the basis of the GNU troff -gs macros; Lenny Muellner adapted them to SGML and implemented the book design. The GNU groff text formatter version 1.09 was used to generate PostScript output. The text and heading fonts are ITC Garamond and MonoType.</p>


<p>Norma Emory copyedited <em>Linux in a 
Nutshell, Third Edition</em>. Kristine Simmons proofread the text. Claire Cloutier, Melanie Wang, and Maureen Dempsey provided quality control reviews. Judy Hoer wrote the index, and Robert Romano and Rhon Porter created the illustrations in Adobe Photoshop 4.0 and Macromedia Freehand 7.0. Interior composition was done by David Bell-Feins, James Carter, and Molly Shangraw.</p>
