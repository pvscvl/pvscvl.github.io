<h2 class="sect1">17.5. A Quick Tour of the fvwm Environment</h2>


<p><a name="INDEX-2522" />In any desktop environment with multiple virtual screens/pages, you
can work on only a single screenful at a time. But <b class="emphasis-bold">fvwm2</b> makes it easy to switch the view between
pages, run applications on different pages, and move applications
between them. If you refer to a particular window all the time, you
can even arrange for it to appear on every page of every desktop.
(We'll come back to this concept of "sticky" windows.) And you're not
limited to viewing a page proper or keeping a window entirely on a
single page.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2523" /><a name="INDEX-2524" /><a name="INDEX-2525" />Notice the long horizontal box in the bottom right corner of our
sample environment (<a href="ch17_05.htm">Figure 17-1</a>). This box is the <b class="emphasis-bold">FvwmButtons</b> module (also called the
<em class="emphasis">button bar</em>). FvwmButtons is generally used to
house a number of tools and applications to which the user needs
frequent access. Often these are other <b class="emphasis-bold">fvwm</b> modules.</p>


<a name="ch17-7-fm2xml" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/LX3_1701.gif/" alt="Figure 17-1" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 17-1. A typical fvwm2 environment</h4><p><a name="INDEX-2526" /><a name="INDEX-2527" /><a name="INDEX-2528" /><a name="INDEX-2529" /><a name="INDEX-2530" /><a name="INDEX-2531" /><a name="INDEX-2532" />In our sample configuration, FvwmButtons contains two other modules:
the Icon Manager (FvwmIconMan) on the left side of the box and to its
right, the Pager (FvwmPager). At the far right of FvwmButtons you'll
also see three small application windows: <b class="emphasis-bold">xbiff</b> (a mailbox that indicates when you have new
messages), <b class="emphasis-bold">xclock</b>, and <b class="emphasis-bold">xload</b> (a graphic representation of your system's
workload).</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2533" /><a name="INDEX-2534" /><a name="INDEX-2535" /><a name="INDEX-2536" /><a name="INDEX-2537" /><a name="INDEX-2538" />The Icon Manager and the Pager are tools that let you both monitor
what's happening in your environment and manipulate the windows
running there. The Icon Manager shows an entry for every conventional
window currently on your display. If that window is iconified, the
Icon Manager entry is preceded by a square that has a
three-dimensional appearance. You can iconify and deiconify any window
on the current page by clicking the first pointer button on the
corresponding entry in the Icon Manager. (The Icon Manager always
shows the windows on the current page; for a similar tool that
reflects what's running on every page on every desktop, check out the
FvwmWinList, described later in this chapter.)</p>


<p>Think of the Pager as a tiny mirror of your entire desktop(s). In a
typical default environment of a single desktop composed of two-by-two
screen pages, the Pager shows a small grid of four partitions
separated by dotted lines. These partitions correspond to the
desktop's four virtual screen pages. (If you configure for multiple
desktops, a solid line is used to show the border between
desktops. The section "Having Multiple Desktops," later in this
chapter, tells you how to set this up.)</p>


<p>Each application you run appears in miniature in the Pager window.
Applications with small windows are fairly hard to spot in miniature,
but a blip representing them is there if you look closely. The
miniature version of a larger client, like <em class="emphasis">xterm</em>,
should have a readable label.</p>


<p>Whatever operations you perform on windows on the desktop -- e.g.,
move, iconify, resize, and so on -- are mirrored in the Pager. But
the Pager is more than a monitor of activity; it's also a tool.  Thus,
you can move the miniature versions, and the actual windows will be
moved. The Pager can also help you move windows between pages and
desktops and select the area to be displayed on your monitor (which
does not have to correspond to a page proper).</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-2539" /><a name="INDEX-2540" /><a name="INDEX-2541" /><a name="INDEX-2542" />In addition to the desktop tools, <b class="emphasis-bold">fvwm2</b>
is commonly configured to provide a slew of cascading menus beginning
with the Root menu. Clicking the first pointer button on the root
window should reveal this menu. The Root menu is usually a good way to
start a new terminal emulator window. If you start with the default
environment for your system, the Root menu is likely to have submenus
like Fvwm Modules, Fvwm Window Ops (which offers items like moving,
resizing, and closing windows), Fvwm Simple Config Ops (for changing
focus policies, how paging works, etc.), and Exit Fvwm (for restarting
or exiting the window manager, starting another one, etc.).</p>


<p>This chapter assumes you know how to perform basic window manager
operations. We're not going to teach you how to use the Pager or all
the menu items. But we will show you how to change the number of
desktops the Pager shows, add menu items, configure keyboard
shortcuts, and make useful customizations.</p>
