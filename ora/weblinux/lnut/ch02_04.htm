<h2 class="sect1">2.4. Overview of Firewalls and Masquerading</h2>



<p><a name="INDEX-129" /><a name="INDEX-130" /><a name="INDEX-131" /><a name="INDEX-132" />A firewall computer is a secure system that sits between an internal
network and an external network (i.e., the Internet).  It is configured
with a set of rules that it uses to determine what traffic is allowed to
pass and what traffic is barred.  While a firewall is generally intended
to protect the network from malicious or even accidentally harmful traffic
from the outside, it can also be configured to monitor traffic leaving
the network. As the sole entry point into the system, the firewall makes
it easier to construct defenses and monitor activity.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-133" />The firewall can also be set up to present a single IP address to the
outside world, even though it may use multiple IP addresses internally. This
is known as <em class="emphasis">masquerading</em>. Masquerading can
act as additional protection hiding the very existence of a
network.  It also saves the trouble and expense of obtaining multiple IP
addresses.</p>


<blockquote><h4 class="objtitle">NOTE</h4>
<p><a name="INDEX-134" /><a name="INDEX-135" />The discussion of <b class="emphasis-bold">iptables</b>
applies to Version 2.4 Linux kernels.  As this book was being written,
both <b class="emphasis-bold">iptables</b> and the 2.4 kernel were
still in development.  The final product may differ slightly from what
we describe here. See the O'Reilly book
<em class="emphasis">Linux Network Administrator's Guide</em> by Olaf Kirch
and Terry Dawson or the the "Linux IPTABLES-HOWTO" for more information. This HOWTO, and a myriad of
others, can be obtained from the the Linux Documentation Project web sites (see <a href="ch00_01.htm">the Preface</a>).</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a name="INDEX-136" /><a name="INDEX-137" />IP firewalling and masquerading are implemented in Linux Version
2.2 with the <b class="emphasis-bold">ipchains</b> utility and in
Linux Version 2.4 with the <b class="emphasis-bold">iptables</b>
facility.  The 2.0 kernels used a command called <b class="emphasis-bold">ipfwadm</b>, which is included in the command
section for older systems but will not be covered here.  The two
newer commands are very similar, but some of the organization of the
rules they use is different.  The firewalling facilities built into
the 2.4 kernel are also designed to be extensible.  If there is some
function missing from the implementation, you could add it.  See the
"Linux netfilter Hacking HOWTO" for details on how to do this.</p>


<p>Most distributions come with all the firewall support already
built into the kernel, but if it is not built into yours, you need to
compile firewall support into the kernel by running <b class="emphasis-bold">make config</b> with the 2.2 kernel and selecting
all of the following networking options:</p>


<ul><li><p>Network firewalls</p></li><li><p>TCP/IP networking</p></li><li><p>IP: firewalling</p></li></ul><p>If you want to support a transparent proxy service on your firewall,
select the following option:</p>


<ul><li><p>IP: transparent proxy support</p></li></ul><p>If you want your firewall to support masquerading, select the following
options as well:</p>


<ul><li><p>IP: masquerading</p></li><li><p>IP: ICMP masquerading</p></li></ul>
<?troff .Nd 10?><p>With the 2.4 kernel, you will need to select these options:</p>


<ul><li><p>Network packet filtering (replaces <b class="emphasis-bold">ipchains</b>)</p></li><li><p>IP tables support (required for
     filtering/masq/NAT)</p></li><li><p>Packet
     filtering</p></li></ul><p>There are several extended target and matching rule modules you
may wish to compile as well.  The behavior of those extension modules
is described under the <b class="emphasis-bold">iptables</b>
command. If you have an existing firewall designed for the 2.2
kernel, or the 2.0 kernel, you can compile support for these older-style 
commands and use them with your new kernel instead of the newer
<b class="emphasis-bold">iptables</b> style of netfiltering.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-138" /><a name="INDEX-139" />The firewalling facility provides built-in rule sets, or chains,
against which each network packet is checked.  In the 2.4 kernel,
these chains are also organized into tables that separate out
filtering functions from masquerading and packet mangling functions.
In either kernel, if a match is found, the counters on that rule are
incremented and any target for that rule is applied.  A target might
accept, reject, or masquerade a packet or even pass it along to
another chain for processing.  Details on the chains provided in both
<b class="emphasis-bold">iptables</b> and <b class="emphasis-bold">ipchains</b> can be found under the description of
the appropriate command.</p>


<p>In addition to these chains, you can create your own user-defined
chains.  You might want a special chain for your PPP interfaces or for
packets from a particular site. To call a user-defined chain, you just
make it the target for a match.</p>


<p>It is possible to make it through a chain without matching any rules
that have a target.  If no rule matches the packet in a user-defined
chain, control returns to the chain from which it was called, and the
next rule in that chain is checked.  If no rule matches the packet in
a built-in chain a default policy for that chain is used.  The default
policy can be any of the special targets that determine what is done
with a packet.  The valid targets for each command are detailed in the
commands section.</p>


<p><a name="INDEX-140" /><a name="INDEX-141" />In the 2.2 kernel, you use the <b class="emphasis-bold">ipchains</b> command to define the rules. Once you
have the rules defined, you can use <b class="emphasis-bold">ipchains-save</b> to create a file with all the
rule definitions and <b class="emphasis-bold">ipchains-restore</b>
to restore those definitions when you reboot.  The equivalent 2.4
kernel command for defining rules is <b class="emphasis-bold">iptables</b>. <b class="emphasis-bold">iptables-save</b> and <b class="emphasis-bold">iptables-restore</b> were not completed at the time
of this writing but should work similarly to their <b class="emphasis-bold">ipchains</b> counterparts.</p>


<p>For more information on the kinds of decisions you need to make
and the considerations that go into defining the rules, see a general
book on firewalls such as the O'Reilly book <em class="emphasis">Building
Internet Firewalls</em> by D. Brent Chapman and Elizabeth
D. Zwicky.  For more details on <b class="emphasis-bold">ipchains</b> or <b class="emphasis-bold">iptables</b>, consult the <em class="emphasis">Linux Network
Administrator's Guide</em>, 2d ed. by Olaf Kirch and Terry Dawson, or
consult one of the relevant HOW-TOs, such as the "Linux IPCHAINS HOW-TO" or the "Linux
<?troff \p?>IPTABLES HOW-TO."</p>
