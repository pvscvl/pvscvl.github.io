<p>Large corporate computing shops have been using complex and expensive
database products for years. These full-featured, heavily optimized
software systems are the only way for a big organization to manage
its volumes of corporate information.</p>





<p>Home computer users haven't traditionally needed database
products at all. They house their data -- addresses, to-do lists,
etc. -- on their systems in small files or in specialized,
off-the-shelf spreadsheet and phone book applications.</p>





<p>A new category of computer users who falls in between these two
extremes has come into play. These persons maintain moderate-sized
information sets required for small organizations, such as new
businesses or nonprofit organizations. Alternatively, such users may
not be just small, but instead may be a geographically isolated part
of a larger company. Or the new kind of users might simply be
individuals interested in maintaining complex, but personal data,
such as a list of songs, from favorite bands, that can be served up
on a personal web page. If you are the kind of person who wants a
database, who is willing to do some work to set one up, but who does
not want to spend six figures on a product and a fleet of programmers
to maintain it, this book is for you.</p>





<p>This book introduces you to the world of small-scale database
development through two popular database products, MySQL and mSQL. We
start by introducing you to relational databases and application
design in the relational world. If you have experience with
relational databases and database design, you can skip on to <a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "MySQL"</a>, or <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "mSQL"</a>, where we
dive into the details of getting up and running with MySQL and mSQL.
If you do skip on, you should note that we do provide a brief
introduction and comparison of the two engines at the end of this
chapter. The rest of the book -- the vast majority of
it -- covers the use of MySQL and mSQL to build and support the
type of applications important to users like you.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">1.1. What Is a Database?</h2>





<p>
<a name="INDEX-1" />A
database is, simply put, a collection of data. An example of a
nonelectronic database is the public library. The library stores
books, periodicals, and other documents. When you need to locate some
data at the library, you search through the card catalog or the
periodicals index, or maybe you even ask the librarian. Another
similar example is the unsorted pile of papers you might find on your
desk. When you need to find something, you rifle through the stack
until you find the scrap of paper you are looking for. This database
works (or maybe it doesn't) because the size of the database is
incredibly small. A stack of papers certainly would not work with a
larger set of data, such as the collections in the library. In the
library, without the card catalog, periodicals index, and librarian,
the library would still be a database; it would just be an unusable
database. A database therefore generally requires some sort of
organization to be of value. Your pile of papers would be much more
reliable if you had some sort of filing system (then maybe you would
not have lost that phone number!). So, restating our definition, we
will define a database as an <em class="emphasis">organized</em>
collection of data.</p>





<p>The library and the stack of papers have many similarities. They are
both databases of documents. It makes no sense, however, to combine
them because your papers are only interesting to you and the library
contains documents of general interest. Both databases have a
specific purpose and they are organized according to that purpose. We
will therefore amend our definition a bit further:
<a name="INDEX-2" />a
database is a collection of data that is
<em class="emphasis">organized</em> and stored according to some
<em class="emphasis">purpose</em>.</p>





<p>Traditional paper-based databases have many disadvantages. They
require a tremendous amount of physical space. Libraries occupy
entire buildings and searching a library is relatively slow. Anyone
who has spent time in a library knows that it can consume a
nontrivial amount of time to find the information you seek. Libraries
are also tedious to maintain and an inordinate amount of time is
spent keeping the catalogs and shelves consistent. Electronic storage
of a database helps to address these issues.</p>





<p>MySQL and mSQL are not databases. They are actually computer software
that enable a user to create, maintain, and manage electronic
databases. This category of software is known as a Database
Management System (DBMS). A <a name="INDEX-3" />DBMS acts as a broker between the
physical database and the users of that database.</p>





<p>When you first began managing electronic information, you almost
certainly used a flat file. The file system file is the electronic
version of the pile of papers on your desk. You likely came to the
conclusion that this sort of ad hoc electronic database didn't
meet your needs any more. A DBMS is the logical next step for your
database needs, and MySQL and mSQL are the first stepping stones into
the world of relational database management systems.</p>
