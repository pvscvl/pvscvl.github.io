<h2 class="sect1">0.3. Using This Book</h2>





<p>We have divided this book into three sections. The first section
covers getting started and managing a MySQL or mSQL database. The
second section builds upon that foundation by demonstrating how you
build applications that use your MySQL or mSQL database. Finally, we
provide a full reference section to provide a resource for quickly
looking up any of the APIs or tools we cover in the first two
sections.</p>





<p>If you are a member of the audience we described earlier, you fall
into one of three categories:</p>





<ul><li><p>MySQL users and administrators</p></li><li><p>mSQL users and administrators</p></li><li><p>Undecided, but definitely will be using either MySQL or mSQL</p></li></ul>
<p>We have directed the first section of the book at database
administrators. We start at a high level by addressing the question
of what exactly is a database. Perhaps you have experience with
databases; if so, such a discussion is certainly way too basic for
you. You will still want to catch the end of <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "Introduction to Relational Databases"</a>, for a short introduction to MySQL and mSQL.
This discussion is of particular interest to anyone who has not yet
made a decision on which database to use and who wants a short
overview of the two.</p>





<p><a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "Database Design"</a>, may appear at first unimportant. It is,
on the contrary, one of the most important chapters of the book.
Proper database design is essential for both database administrators
and programmers if the goal is to build database applications that
will be flexible enough to scale as application needs change. You
also need a proper database design if you want your database to
actually perform well.</p>





<p><a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Installation"</a>, covers installation of both engines.</p>





<p>If you have chosen a particular database engine, you can skip either
<a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "MySQL"</a>, or <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "mSQL"</a>. Each
chapter is specific to one of the two database engines and is
completely irrelevant to users of the other engine. If, however, you
have not yet made a decision, then these two chapters will be key to
your selection process.</p>





<p>We close out the administrative section with a discussion of the
variants of SQL presented by MySQL and mSQL. While programmers may be
largely uninterested in the first section, they will find the need to
occasionally refer to this section even if they are experienced SQL
programmers. Anyone who has never before used SQL definitely needs to
read this chapter.</p>





<p>The second section begins with an overview of the client/server
programming model. This discussion is very high level, but it is key
to understanding how the database and the application programming
work together to build a solid database application. Of course, if
you are experienced with client/server programming in other
environments, this sort of architectural discussion may be old hat to
you. The rest of the section contains chapters devoted to programming
in specific languages or using specific tools. Of particular interest
to web programmers will be the chapters on Perl, Java, Python, and
PHP.</p>





<p>The book closes with a reference section that covers all of the tools
and APIs we address in the book.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a></p><blockquote>




<a name="FOOTNOTE-1" /><p>[1]<a href="ch22_01.htm">Chapter 22, "JDBC Reference"</a>, is a revised version of an appendix from
O'Reilly's Database Programming with JDBC and Java by
George Reese.</p>
