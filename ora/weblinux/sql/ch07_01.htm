<p>When mSQL first appeared on the scene, it was the only <a name="INDEX-549" />
<a name="INDEX-550" />mid-range database engine supporting
SQL. It did not hold that distinction very long. Of course, you
already know about one other such database: MySQL. In the years since
mSQL's introduction, however, a handful of mid-range database
engines have been released. In this book, we have focused on MySQL
and mSQL due to their overwhelming similarities and their unequalled
popularity. It would, however, be an injustice to fail to mention the
other databases out there.</p>





<p>People use databases for so many things that it is hard to capture
all of the tools for all possible uses in one package. The major
database vendors attempt that goal. They pay for it in terms of
performance and you pay for it in terms of price. The low-end
database engines, on the other hand, are so very specialized as to be
of little use to the small business or nonprofit organization or
anyone else with unusual needs. The mid-range database engines fill
an important void between the two extremes.</p>





<p>At this point, we have only looked at two very similar views of
meeting mid-range database requirements. These approaches are
definitely not the only ones. There is no law, for example, that says
just because you are not a big company that you do not need
transaction support. Some users in the mid-range may also need
triggers, subselects, stored procedures, object-oriented support, or
any of a host of potential features -- they just do not need them
all. The different mid-range database engines thus serve import needs
that may not be served by MySQL or mSQL.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">7.1. What Is "Free"?</h2>





<p>You may occasionally hear people refer to MySQL and mSQL as being
"free." When you hear people compare MySQL and mSQL, they
may even make the claim that MySQL is "more free" than
mSQL. Common sense chokes on the expression "more free."
The software world, however, has actually invented the idea of
"degrees of freeness."</p>





<p>Until now, we have been consciously avoiding discussing MySQL and
mSQL as "free" database engines due to "free"
being such a loaded term in the software world. Both engines may
actually cost you money for a license. It depends on who you are.
Under the licenses in play at the time of this book's printing,
a university does not have to pay a licensing fee for either database
engine. A commercial user of mSQL, however, must pay for a license.
When people claim MySQL is "more free" than mSQL, what
they mean is that MySQL costs nothing for more people than mSQL does.</p>





<p>Another issue that affects the concept of "free" in the
software world has little to do with price. It has to do with the
ability to view and modify the source code without paying extra.
Under this model, both MySQL and mSQL are totally free database
engines. You can go to their download sites and get them in source
form. If you are one of those users who has to pay to use MySQL or
mSQL, you do not have to pay any more for the source.</p>





<p>The software world has come up with a new term designed to get around
the overloaded concept of "free". It is called Open
Source. In fact, the term "<a name="INDEX-551" />Open Source" is now a trademark
meaning software whose source code is open regardless of the charges
associated with using the software. Linux, Netscape, FreeBSD, Perl,
Apache, all GNU products, as well as many products in this book like
MySQL, mSQL, mm.mysql.jdbc, and mSQL-JDBC (just to name a few) are
all Open Source products.</p>





<p>The other database engines we mention in this chapter are also Open
Source products. Open source is very important to the mid-range world
because the big guys tend to view that market as too small to merit
their attention and the low-end developers see the mid-range as too
complicated to merit theirs.</p>
