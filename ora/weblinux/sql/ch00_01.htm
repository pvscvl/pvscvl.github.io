<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>










<p>In the world of computing, the 1990s may rightly be called the decade
of <em class="emphasis">Open Source software</em>. From Linux to Perl, from palmtop to
mainframe, the Open Source movement has left a mark in practically
every niche of technology. This impact is especially strong in the
commercially neglected world of mid-range server applications
commonly needed by nonprofit organizations and small businesses.</p>





<p>The idea of mid-range servers was fairly rare in the first few
decades of the computer age. Computers were expensive items used by
large institutions such as banks and universities. Enormous
time-sharing servers provided the computing power for entire
companies. Much of the software running on these systems was as
monolithic as the servers themselves. After all, because only one
computer was serving several departments -- if not the whole
organization -- that computer had to fulfill everyone's
needs.</p>





<p>At the other end of the spectrum was the personal computer. With the
PC revolution, you could find one computer for every household
instead of one computer for an entire company. While these computers
were easily powerful enough to satisfy the needs of a single user, a
wide gulf still existed between the capabilities -- and the
costs -- of personal computing and corporate computing.</p>





<p>The area where this gulf was most apparent was in data management.
Database applications for large mainframe servers included every
feature possible. Because of the multipurpose nature of this
software, if any odd feature was needed by a single user, it was
included. Database applications that satisfied those data management
needs of the individual user emerged. However, where mainframe
databases were too massive for mid-range needs, personal databases
were too narrow.</p>





<p>In the first half of the 1990s, the "lowly" personal
computer had advanced to the point where it was actually more
powerful than the mainframe computers of yesteryear. While hardware
was no longer a barrier to mid-range computing, the lack of
affordable software was. To meet the data storage needs of a
nonprofit organization or small business, you needed an affordable
server operating system and an affordable database management system.
The introduction of cheap and powerful server operating systems like
FreeBSD and Linux helped solve the operating system side of that
equation.</p>





<p>MySQL and mSQL are two solutions that solve the database management
side of the equation. They are powerful and flexible while at the
same time lightweight and efficient. MySQL, in particular, packs a
large feature set into a very small and fast engine. While neither
database engine has anywhere near the full feature set of expensive
corporate databases, they easily have enough of a feature set to meet
the needs of mid-range database management.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Audience</h2>





<p>This book is primarily for two classes of readers. The most obvious
is the reader interested in using MySQL and mSQL from either a
database administration perspective or from a database programmer
perspective. In addition, anyone who wants to learn about relational
database administration and programming without paying out the nose
for a license from one of the big guys will find MySQL or mSQL an
excellent starting point. If MySQL or mSQL is your starting point,
then this book is your guide.</p>





<p>From a database administrator's perspective, we cover the basic
methods of creating and managing databases and tables in MySQL and
mSQL. We go beyond the simple and provide performance tuning and
troubleshooting tips to help you make sure your MySQL and mSQL
applications are running their best. Finally, all of the tools that
come with MySQL and mSQL are covered in detail. We assume no prior
knowledge of SQL or relational databases.</p>





<p>Database programmers will find that we have covered all of the major
programming interfaces from the most popular client/server and web
programming languages. When we cover the interface for a particular
language, we assume that the reader has a basic grasp of the language
in question. For example, in the Java<img align="absmiddle" src="figs/U2122.gif"> chapter, we assume that
the reader knows how to write basic Java applications and now wants
to learn how to make those Java applications talk to a MySQL or mSQL
database.</p>





<p>The immense popularity of MySQL and mSQL on the Web has made it
natural to provide a focus on CGI programming with MySQL and mSQL.
Web developers should therefore find this book useful in describing
how to drive their web sites with a MySQL or mSQL database. For these
chapters, very little CGI knowledge is needed, but we still assume
that the reader is familiar with the basics of the programming
language in question.</p>
