<p>
<a name="INDEX-15" />According
to our definition of a database, a database is an organized
collection of data that serves some purpose. Just having a DBMS is
not sufficient to give your database purpose. How you use your data
defines its purpose. Imagine a library where nobody ever reads the
books. There would not be much point in storing and organizing all of
those books if they were never used. Now, imagine a library where you
could not change or add to the collection. The utility of the library
as a database would decrease over time since obsolete books could
never be replaced and new books could never be added. In short, a
library exists so that people may read the books and find the
information they seek.</p>





<p>
<a name="INDEX-16" />Databases exist so that people can
interact with them. In the case of electronic databases, the
interaction occurs not directly with the database, but instead
indirectly through software applications. Before the emergence of the
World Wide Web, databases typically were used by large corporations
to support various business functions: accounting and financials,
shipping and inventory control, manufacturing planning, human
resources, and so on. The web and more complex home computing tasks
have helped move the need for database applications outside the realm
of the large corporation.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-17" />The area in which databases have
experienced the most explosive growth -- an area where MySQL and
mSQL excel -- is in web application development. As the demand for
more complex and robust web applications grows, so does the need for
databases. A database backend can support many critical functions on
the web. Virtually any web content can be driven by a database.</p>





<p>Consider the example of a catalog retailer who would like to publish
on the web and accept orders online. If the catalog were published as
HTML files, someone would have to hand edit the catalog each time a
new item was added or a price changed. If the catalog information
were instead stored in a relational database, it would be possible to
publish real time catalog updates simply by changing the product or
price data in the database. It would also become possible to
integrate the online catalog with existing electronic order
processing systems. Using a database to drive such a web site thus
has obvious advantages for both the retailer and the customer.</p>





<p>Here's how a web page typically interacts with a database. The
database is on your web server or another machine that your server
can talk to (a good DBMS makes this kind of distributed
responsibility easy). You put a form on one web page that the user
fills in with a query or data to submit. When the form's query
is sent to your server, it runs a program that you write that
extracts the data submitted by the user. These programs most often
come in the form of CGI scripts and Java servlets, but can also occur
by embedding programming right inside the HTML page. We will look at
all of these methods in this book.</p>





<p>Now your program knows what the user is asking for or wishes to add
to the database. The program issues an SQL query or update, and the
database magically takes care of the rest. Any results obtained from
the database can be formatted by your program into a new HTML page to
send back to the user.<a name="INDEX-18" /></p>
