<h2 class="sect1">7.3. PostgreSQL</h2>





<p>The current incarnation of the Postgres Object-Relational Database
Management System is known as
<a name="INDEX-563" />PostgreSQL
(a.k.a. Postgres 6). While Postgres has had SQL capabilities for only
three years, the system itself is over a decade old. In the early
1980s, Dr. Michael <a name="INDEX-564" />Stonebreaker of the University of
California at Berkeley designed a database system that pioneered many
of the concepts found in today's relational database systems.
This database engine was known as
<a name="INDEX-565" />Ingres (later <a name="INDEX-566" />University Ingres). Ingres was a free,
university funded project that quickly gathered a following among
other computer scientists around the world.</p>





<p>One company saw the business potential in this academic product and
it eventually trademarked and commercialized Ingres as a product. The
original, free version of Ingres was renamed University Ingres and
its development continued independent of the commercial version.</p>





<p>After a period of time, Dr. Stonebreaker's research led him
further away from the original design goals of Ingres. He decided
that it was time to design a completely new database system that
extended the ideas of Ingres and went beyond into new territory. The
database system became known as Postgres for Post-Ingres.</p>





<p>Postgres, like Ingres, was a university funded project that has been
free to the public. Also like Ingres, the commercial sector took
notice of Postgres and the commercial product Illustra<a href="#FOOTNOTE-11">[11]</a> was born. Free
Postgres has continued on and ranks up there in popularity with MySQL
and mSQL for mid-range database servers.</p><blockquote>




<a name="FOOTNOTE-11" /><p>[11]Illustra was bought out by Informix in 1995 and is now part of
their Universal Server product.</p>




</blockquote>





<p>In 1995, two developments happened that shaped the future of
Postgres. First, two of Dr. Stonebreaker's graduate students,
Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen, designed an SQL interface into Postgres.
Here, a few years after David Hughes first developed MiniSQL as a SQL
front-end to Postgres, Postgres finally had a true SQL front-end.
With SQL support came increased popularity. As with both mSQL and
MySQL, an increase in popularity brought on an increase for demand in
new features. The result was an object-relational database engine for
the mid-range that supports transactions, triggers, and subselects.
