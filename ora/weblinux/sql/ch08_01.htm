<p>Before we explore the details of database application development in
various languages, we should take a moment to take a broader look at
the question of how you architect database applications. The focus of
this chapter is conceptual; we are going to take a look at the
client/server architecture behind database programming. The issues
are important for programming with MySQL and mSQL, but they are not
specific to these database engines. They are instead issues you can
apply to programming in any database environment. Without these
concepts, however, you may find that your database applications
neither meet your current needs nor adapt to meet any changing needs.
Our look at database programming covers such complex issues as
understanding common two-tier development, object-to-relational
mapping, and two-tier's more cutting-edge sibling, three-tier
client/server.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">8.1. The Client/Server Architecture</h2>





<p>At its simplest, the <a name="INDEX-574" />
<a name="INDEX-575" />client/server architecture is about
dividing up application processing into two or more logically
distinct pieces. We have spent the entire book so far discussing the
database as if it exists in some sort of vacuum. It serves its
purpose only when being used by other applications. The database, at
its simplest, makes up one piece of the client/server architecture.
The database is the `server'; any application that uses
that data is a `client.' In many cases, the client and
server reside on separate machines; in most cases, the client
application is some sort of user-friendly interface to the database.
<a href="ch08_01.htm">Figure 8-1</a> provides a graphical representation of a
simple client/server system.</p>

<p>You have probably seen this sort of architecture all over the
Internet. In fact, we will be addressing the specific problem of
client/server Internet applications throughout this book. The web,
for example, is a giant client/server application in which the web
browser is the client and the web server is the server. In this
scenario, the server is not a relational database server, but instead
a specialized file server. The essential quality of a server is that
it serves data in some format to a client.</p>





<p>When you build a database application, you first need some way for
the client to communicate with the database. Database vendors like to
hide the underlying communication from developers in the form of
language-specific APIs. When you write a database application, you
write them with special libraries that translate your requests into
TCP/IP packets that travel across the network to a database server.</p>





<p>The look of these database APIs varies both according to the language
you are writing in and, in many cases, according to the database you
are using. Because MySQL's APIs were designed to look a lot
like mSQL's, however, all the APIs you will encounter in this
book only have minor differences.<a name="INDEX-576" />
