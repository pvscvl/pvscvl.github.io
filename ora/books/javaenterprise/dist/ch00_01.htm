<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>



<p>In a sense, distributed computing has been with us since the
beginning of computer technology. A conventional computer can be
thought of as "internally distributed," in the sense that
separate, distinct devices within the computer are responsible for
certain well-defined tasks (arithmetic/logic operations, operator
stack storage, short/long-term data storage). These
"distributed" devices are interconnected by communication
pathways that carry information (register values, data) and messages
(assembler instructions, microcode instructions). The sources and
destinations of these various pathways are literally hardwired, and
the "protocols" that they use to carry information and
messages are rigidly defined and highly specific. Reorganizing the
distribution scheme of these devices involves chip fabrication,
soldering, and the recoding of microprograms, or the construction of
a completely new computer. This level of inflexibility offers
benefits, however, in terms of processing speed and
information-transfer latencies. The functions expected of a computing
device at this level are very well defined and bounded (perform
arithmetic and logic operations on data, and store the results);
therefore, the architecture of the device can and should be highly
optimized for these tasks.
</p>

<p>The history of truly <a name="INDEX-1"></a>
distributed computing begins with the first day that someone tapped a
mainframe operator on the shoulder and asked, "Hey, is there
any way we can both use that?" Display terminals, with no
computing capabilities themselves, were developed to be attached to
monolithic central computing devices, and to communicate with them in
very rigid and limited protocols. This allowed multiple users to
access and submit jobs to the mainframe. Other I/O devices also
needed to be attached to the mainframe, generally to store and
retrieve data to/from other non-volatile forms (printed storage such
as paper tape and punch cards, and later magnetic storage devices).
For the most part, the physical links and communications protocols
used to hook in these devices were custom designed for each case, and
not reusable for other devices.
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, people began to desire personal, dedicated computing
resources that were available on demand, not when the mainframe
schedule said so. The personal computer fit the bill, and its
popularity has been growing ever since. Personal computers and
workstations, despite the larger numbers of units, followed a similar
evolutionary path to mainframes with respect to peripheral devices.
Many and varied hardware and communications protocols were born to
allow printers, disk drives, pointing devices, and the like to be
connected to people's desktop computers. At first, peripheral
vendors saw these custom-fit solutions as a potential for competitive
advantage in the market; i.e., make your hardware or software faster
or more laden with features than the next product, to become the
preferred vendor of whatever it is you make. Gradually, both users
and makers of personal computers became weary of this game. Users
became frustrated with the lack of consistency in the installation,
use, and maintenance of these devices, and computer makers were faced
with an array of hardware and software interfaces, from which they
had to choose the most advantageous ones to support directly in their
hardware and operating systems. This became one of the major
attractions for buyers of Apple's computer line, second only to
their user-friendly operating system. Apple defined and strictly
controlled the hardware and software interfaces to their systems,
thereby guaranteeing that any third-party devices or software that
followed their specifications and standards would operate correctly
with their computers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-2"></a>The concept of standards for hardware
and software interfaces caught on at many levels. Standards for every
level of distributed computing, from hardware interfaces, network
cabling, and physical-level communications protocols, all the way up
to application-level protocols, were developed, refined, and promoted
in the marketplace. Some standards achieved a critical usage mass,
for various reasons, and persist today, such as Ethernet, TCP/IP, and
RPC. Others were less popular, and faded with time.
</p>

<p>Today, both computing devices and network bandwidth have begun to
achieve commodity status. A set of standard protocols, some of which
make up the World Wide Web, are beginning to evolve into a worldwide
network operating system. Specifics about the type of hardware,
operating system, and network being used are becoming more and more
irrelevant, making information and tools to process information more
and more easily deployable and available. Security protocols have
been defined to help owners of information and services restrict
access to them. Researchers and developers are looking forward to the
next evolutionary steps in information technology, such as autonomous
agents and enterprise-wide distributed object systems. In the midst
of this revolutionary period, Java&#153; can be viewed as both a
product and a catalyst of all of these trends. Java offers an
environment in which the network is truly the computer, and specifics
such as operating system features and transport protocols become even
more blurred and less important, though not yet completely
irrelevant. The Java language and environment promise to play a
prominent part in the next generation of distributed
computing.<a name="INDEX-3"></a>
</p>




<h2 class="sect1">0.1. What Does This Book Cover?</h2>

<p>This book is an overview of the tools and techniques that are at your
disposal for building distributed computing systems in Java. In most
cases, these tools are provided inherently in the Java API itself,
such as the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) API, the Java
Security API, and the Java&#153; Database Connectivity ( JDBC)
package. Other tools are standards and protocols that exist
independently of Java and its environment, but are supported within
Java, either through its core APIs or by add-on APIs offered by
third-party vendors. Some examples include the Common Object Request
Broker Adapter (CORBA) standards, the multicast IP protocol, and the
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) standard.
</p>

<p>I intend this book to serve as both explanatory and reference
material for you, the professional developer. Most of the book is
made up of detailed explanations of concepts, tools, and techniques
that come into play in most distributed computing situations. At the
same time, for readers who are more familiar with the subject matter,
the text and code examples are broken up into subject areas that
should make it fairly easy to reference important bits.
</p>

<a name="JDP-PREFACE-SECT-1.1"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">0.1.1. Organization</h3>

<p>The first four chapters of the book (after the Introduction) cover
some fundamental tools that come into play in most distributed
applications: basic networking tools, distributed objects,
multithreading, and security measures. The last five chapters go into
detail about some common types of distributed applications:
message-passing systems, multitier systems involving databases,
bandwidth-limited systems, and systems that allow multiple
distributed users or user agents to collaborate dynamically over a
network; and discuss the special issues that arise in each.
</p>

<p>The figure on the next page shows the dependence of the various
chapters on each other, to give you a sense of the order (random or
otherwise) that you can choose as you journey through the book. Since
the Introduction covers some concepts and terminology that will
persist throughout the book, I'd suggest reading it before any
of the others. The next four chapters can be read in just about any
order, depending on your level of experience with each topic. Since
the later chapters use concepts from all of the chapters in the first
part of the book, you should have a basic understanding of their
topics, either from personal experience or from reading the earlier
chapters, before delving into the second part of the book.
