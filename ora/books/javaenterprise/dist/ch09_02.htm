<h2 class="sect1">9.2. Issues with Collaboration</h2>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-1221"></a>For
the most part, the issues that come up with collaborative systems are
similar to those that arise in other concurrent programming tasks. In
the context of collaborative systems, some of these issues take on
even more importance; and, of course, collaboration raises a few
issues of it own. In this section, we'll look briefly at four
of the most important issues: communication needs, identity
management, shared state information, and performance.
</p>

<a name="JDP-CH-9-SECT-2.1"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">9.2.1. Communication Needs</h3>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-1222"></a>A collaborative system has multiple
remote agents collaborating dynamically, so it must be flexible in
its ability to route transactions. Depending on the application, the
underlying communications might need to support point-to-point
messages between agents, broadcast messages sent to the entire agent
community, or "narrowcast" messages sent to specific
groups of participating agents. An interactive chat server that
supports chat rooms is a good example of this. Messages are normally
broadcast to the entire group, but if an individual is in a single
chat room, then her messages should only be sent to the other
participants in that room. In some cases, you may need to support
private, one-on-one messaging between agents or users in the system
(e.g., for private discussions).
</p>

<p>In addition to simple message-like communications, there may be a
need for agents to have a richer interface to other agents. Agents
may need to pass object data to each other, and remote agents may
need to interact directly with each other through distributed object
interfaces.
</p>


<a name="JDP-CH-9-SECT-2.2"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">9.2.2. Maintaining Agent Identities</h3>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-1223"></a><a name="INDEX-1224"></a>If
multiple agents are engaged in a collaboration, there has to be some
way to uniquely identify them so that messages can be addressed and
delivered, tasks can be assigned, etc. Also, if access to the system
or to certain resources associated with the system needs to be
restricted, then participant identities will need to be authenticated
as well. Depending on the application, there may also be data or
other resources associated with individual agents. This information
must be maintained along with agent identities, and in some cases
access to these resources must be controlled based on identities.
</p>

<p>A practical example of this issue is a <a name="INDEX-1225"></a><a name="INDEX-1226"></a> shared
whiteboard application. A shared whiteboard is a virtual drawing
space that multiple remote users can view and "write" on
in order to share information, ideas, etc.--the digital
equivalent of a group of people working around a real whiteboard in a
meeting room. In order for the individuals using the whiteboard to
understand what is being contributed by whom, the whiteboard system
has to keep some kind of identity information for each participant.
Each participant's contributions to the whiteboard (e.g.,
written information, graphics, etc.) must be shown with a visual
indication of who is responsible for it (e.g., color, shading, etc.).
It may also be desirable to allow each individual the right to modify
or delete only his contributions to the whiteboard, which means
adding access control based on identities.<a name="INDEX-1227"></a><a name="INDEX-1228"></a>
</p>


<a name="JDP-CH-9-SECT-2.3"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">9.2.3. Shared State Information</h3>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-1229"></a><a name="INDEX-1230"></a>In many collaborative systems some data
and resources are shared among participants. Shared data is common to
most distributed systems, but is particularly important in
collaborative systems. A cooperative effort among computing agents is
usually expressed in terms of a set of data that needs to be shared
by all agents in the system. In our shared whiteboard example, the
current contents of the whiteboard are shared among all agents. With
multiple agents accessing and potentially modifying this shared state
information, maintaining the integrity of the information will be an
important issue. If two or more agents attempt to alter the same
piece of shared state information, then there has to be a reasonable
and consistent way to determine how to merge these requests, and how
to make it known to the affected agents what's been done with
their transactions.
</p>


<a name="JDP-CH-9-SECT-2.4"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">9.2.4. Performance</h3>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-1231"></a>Some collaborative systems have to make a
trade-off between keeping shared state consistent across all the
agents and maximizing the overall performance. There are situations,
such as in shared whiteboard applications, where it's important
that all of the agents in the system have their view of the shared
state of the system kept up-to-date as closely as possible. The
simplest way to do this is to have a central mediator acting as a
clearinghouse for agent events. The mediator gets notified whenever
an agent does something that changes the shared state of the system,
and the mediator is responsible for sending these state updates to
all of the agents in the system. This also makes it simple to ensure
that updates are sequenced correctly across all agents, if
that's important to the application.
</p>

<p>The problem is that the central mediator can become a bottleneck as
the size of the system scales up. If there are lots of agents to be
notified or lots of changes that agents have to be notified about,
then the mediator may have trouble keeping up with the traffic and
the agents in the system will waste a lot of time waiting for
updates. Another approach would be not to use a mediator at all, and
instead have a peer-to-peer system where each agent broadcasts its
updates to all the other agents. While this may improve the
throughput of updates, it makes it difficult to maintain consistency
across the system. With each update being broadcast independently and
asynchronously, it can be quite a feat to make sure that each agent
ends up with the same state after all the updates have been sent,
especially if the order of the updates is important.<a name="INDEX-1232"></a><a name="INDEX-1233"></a>
