<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>


<p>When I first mentioned to a colleague of mine that I was writing a
book on Java<sup class="superscript">TM</sup> security, he immediately
starting asking me questions about firewalls and Internet DMZs.
Another colleague overheard us and started asking about electronic
commerce, which piqued the interest of a third colleague who wanted
to hear all about virtual private networks. All this was interesting,
but what I really wanted to talk about was how a Java applet could be
allowed to read a file.</p>

<p>Such is the danger of anything with the word "security"
in its title: security is a broad topic, and everyone has his or her
own notion of what security means. Complicating this issue is the
fact that Java security and network security (including Internet
security) are complementary and sometimes overlapping topics: you can
send encrypted data over the network with Java, or you can set up a
virtual private network that encrypts all your network traffic and
remove the need for encryption within your Java programs.
</p>

<p>This is a book about security from the perspective of a Java program.
In this book, we discuss the basic platform features of Java that
provide security--the class loader, the bytecode verifier, the
security manager--and we discuss recent additions to Java that
enhance this security model--digital signatures, security
providers, and the access controller. The ideas in this book are
meant to provide an understanding of the architecture of Java's
security model and how that model can be used (both programmatically
and administratively).
</p>



<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Who Should Read This Book?</h2>

<p>This book is intended primarily for programmers who want to write
secure Java applications. Much of the book is focused on various APIs
within Java that provide security; we discuss both how those APIs are
used by standard Java-enabled browsers and how they can be used in
your own Java applications. From a programming perspective, this
latter case is the most interesting: Java-enabled browsers have each
adopted particular security models, but there's not much a
programmer or administrator can do to alter those models. However,
this is beginning to change, as technologies like Sun
Microsystems' Java Plug-in bring Sun's basic security
model to popular browsers.
</p>

<p>For the end user or system administrator who is interested in Java
security, this book will provide knowledge of the facilities provided
by the basic Java platform and how those facilities are used by
Java-enabled browsers and by Java applications. We do not delve into
the specific security features of any Java-enabled browser, although
we do point out along the way which security features of Java are
subject to change by the companies that provide Java-enabled
browsers. Hence, end users and system administrators can read this
book (and skip over many of the programming examples) to gain an
understanding of the fundamental security features of the Java
platform, and they can understand from each of its parts how the
security feature might be administrated (especially for Java
applications). This is particularly true for end users and
administrators who are interested in assessing the risk of using
Java: we give full details of the implementation of Java's
security model not only so that you can program within that model
(and adjust it if necessary), but also so that you have a deep
understanding of how it works and can assess for yourself whether or
not Java meets your definition of security.
</p>

<p>From a programming perspective, we assume that developers who read
this book have a good knowledge of how to program in Java, and in
particular how to write Java applications. When we discuss advanced
security features and cryptographic algorithms, we do so assuming
that the programmer is primarily interested in using the API to
perform certain tasks. Hence, we explain at a rudimentary level what
a digital signature is and how it is created and used, but we do not
explain the cryptographic theory behind a digital signature or prove
that a digital signature is secure. For developers who are
sufficiently versed in these matters, we also show how the APIs may
be extended to support new types of cryptographic algorithms, but
again we leave the mathematics and rigorous definitions of
cryptography for another book.
