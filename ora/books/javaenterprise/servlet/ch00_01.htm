<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>


<p>In late 1996, Java on the server side was coming on strong. Several
major software vendors were marketing technologies specifically aimed
at helping server-side Java developers do their jobs more
efficiently. Most of these products provided a prebuilt
infrastructure that could lift the developer's attention from
the raw socket level into the more productive application level. For
example, <a name="INDEX-1"></a>Netscape introduced
something it named "<a name="INDEX-2"></a><a name="INDEX-3"></a><a name="INDEX-4"></a>server-side applets"; the World
Wide Web Consortium included <a name="INDEX-5"></a>extensible modules called
"resources" with its Java-based Jigsaw web server; and
with its WebSite server, O'Reilly Software promoted the use of
a technology it (only coincidentally) dubbed "servlets."
The drawback: each of these technologies was tied to a particular
server and designed for very specific tasks.
</p>

<p>Then, in early 1997, <a name="INDEX-6"></a><a name="INDEX-7"></a>
JavaSoft (a company that has since been reintegrated into Sun
Microsystems as the <a name="INDEX-8"></a><a name="INDEX-9"></a>Java Software division)
finalized Java servlets. This action consolidated the scattered
technologies into a single, standard, generic mechanism for
developing modular server-side Java code. Servlets were designed to
work with both Java-based and non-Java-based servers. Support for
servlets has since been implemented in nearly every web server, from
Apache to Zeus, and in many non-web servers as well.
</p>

<p>Servlets have been quick to gain acceptance because, unlike many new
technologies that must first explain the problem or task they were
created to solve,
<a name="INDEX-10"></a>
servlets are a clear solution to a well-recognized and widespread
need: generating dynamic web content. From corporations down to
individual web programmers, people who struggled with the maintenance
and performance problems of CGI-based web programming are turning to
servlets for their power, portability, and efficiency. Others, who
were perhaps intimidated by CGI programming's apparent reliance
on manual HTTP communication and the Perl and C languages, are
looking to servlets as a manageable first step into the world of web
programming.
</p>

<p>This book explains everything you need to know about Java servlet
programming. The first five chapters cover the basics: what servlets
are, what they do, and how they work. The following eight chapters
are where the true meat is--they explore the things you are
likely to do with servlets. You'll find numerous examples,
several suggestions, a few warnings, and even a couple of true hacks
that somehow made it past technical review.
</p>

<p>We cover <a name="INDEX-11"></a>Version
2.0 of the Servlet API, which was introduced as part of the Java Web
Server 1.1 in December 1997 and clarified by the release of the Java
Servlet Development Kit 2.0 in April 1998. Changes in the API from
Version 1.0, finalized in June 1997, are noted throughout the text.
</p>



<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Audience</h2>

<p>Is this book for you? It is if you're interested in extending
the functionality of a server--such as extending a web server to
generate dynamic content. Specifically, this book was written to
help:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>CGI programmers  </b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>CGI is a popular but somewhat crude method of extending the
functionality of a web server. Servlets provide an elegant, efficient
alternative.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<b>NSAPI, ISAPI, ASP, and Server-Side JavaScript programmers</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each of these technologies can be used as a CGI alternative, but each
has limitations regarding portability, security, and/or performance.
Servlets tend to excel in each of these areas.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Java applet programmers</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>It has always been difficult for an applet to talk to a server.
Servlets make it easier by giving the applet an easy-to-connect-to,
Java-based agent on the server.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Authors of web pages with server-side includes</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pages that use server-side includes to call CGI programs can use
<tt class="literal">&lt;SERVLET&gt;</tt> tags to add content more
efficiently to a page.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Authors of web pages with different appearances</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>By this we mean pages that must be available in different languages,
have to be converted for transmission over a low-bandwidth
connection, or need to be modified in some manner before they are
sent to the client. Servlets provide something called servlet
chaining that can be used for processing of this type. Each servlet
in a servlet chain knows how to catch, process, and return a specific
kind of content. Thus, servlets can be linked together to do language
translation, change large color images to small black-and-white ones,
convert images in esoteric formats to standard GIF or JPEG images, or
nearly anything else you can think of.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">0.1.1. What You Need to Know</h3>

<p>When we first started writing this book, we found to our surprise
that one of the hardest things was determining what to assume about
you, the reader. Are you familiar with Java? Have you done CGI or
other web application programming before? Or are you getting your
feet wet with servlets? Do you understand HTTP and HTML, or do those
acronyms seem perfectly interchangeable? No matter what experience
level we imagined, it was sure to be too simplistic for some and too
advanced for others.
</p>

<p>In the end, this book was written with the notion that it should
contain predominantly original material: it could leave out
exhaustive descriptions of topics and concepts that are well
described online or in other books. Scattered throughout the text,
you'll find several references to these external sources of
information.
</p>

<p>Of course, external references only get you so far. This book expects
you are comfortable with the Java programming language and basic
object-oriented programming techniques. If you are coming to servlets
from another language, we suggest you prepare yourself by reading a
<a name="INDEX-12"></a><a name="INDEX-13"></a>book on
general Java programming, such as <em class="citetitle">Exploring
Java</em><a name="INDEX-14"></a><a name="INDEX-15"></a>, by Patrick Niemeyer and Joshua Peck
(O'Reilly). You may want to skim quickly the sections on
applets and AWT (graphical) programming and spend extra time on
network and multithreaded programming. If you want to get started
with servlets right away and learn Java as you go, we suggest you
read this book with a copy of <em class="citetitle">Java in a
Nutshell</em><a name="INDEX-16"></a><a name="INDEX-17"></a>, by David Flanagan
(O'Reilly), or another Java reference book, at your side.
</p>

<p>This book does <em class="emphasis">not</em> assume you have extensive
experience with web programming, HTTP, and HTML. But neither does it
provide a full introduction to or exhaustive description of these
technologies. We'll cover the basics necessary for effective
servlet development and leave the finer points (such as a complete
list of HTML tags and HTTP 1.1 headers) to other sources.
