<h2 class="sect1">0.6. Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>The authors would like to say a big thank you to the book's
technical reviewers, whose constructive criticism has done much to
improve this work: Mike Slinn, Mike Hogarth, James Duncan Davidson,
Dan Pritchett, Dave McMurdie, and Rob Clark. We're still in
shock that it took one reviewer just three days to read what took us
a full year to write!

<h3 class="sect2">0.6.1. Jason Hunter</h3>

<p>In a sense, this book began March 20, 1997, at the Computer Literacy
bookstore in San Jose, California. There--after a hilarious talk
by Larry Wall and Randall Schwartz, where Larry explained how he
manages to automate his house using Perl--I met the esteemed Tim
O'Reilly for the first time. I introduced myself and brazenly
told him that some day (far in the future, I thought) I had plans to
write an O'Reilly book. I felt like I was telling Steven
Spielberg I planned to star in one of his movies. To my complete and
utter surprise, Tim replied, "On what topic?" So began
the roller coaster ride that resulted in this book.
</p>

<p>There have been several high points I fondly remember: meeting my
editor (cool, she's young, too!), signing the official contract
(did you know that all of O'Reilly's official paper has
animals on it?), writing the first sentence (over and over), printing
the first chapter (and having it look just like an O'Reilly
book), and then watching as the printouts piled higher and higher,
until eventually there was nothing more to write (well, except the
acknowledgments).
</p>

<p>There have been a fair number of trying times as well. At one point,
when the book was about half finished, I realized the Servlet API was
changing faster than I could keep up. I believe in the saying,
"If at first you don't succeed, ask for help," so
after a quick talent search I asked William Crawford, who was already
working on <em class="emphasis">Java Enterprise in a Nutshell</em>, if he
could help speed the book to completion. He graciously agreed and in
the end wrote two chapters, as well as portions of the appendices.
</p>

<p>There are many others who have helped in the writing of this book,
both directly and indirectly. I'd like to say thank you to
Paula Ferguson, the book's editor, and Mike Loukides, the Java
series editor, for their efforts to ensure (and improve) the quality
of this book. And to Tim O'Reilly for giving me the chance to
fulfill a dream.
</p>

<p>Thanks also to my managers at Silicon Graphics, Kathy Tansill and
Walt Johnson, for providing me with more encouragement and
flexibility than I had any right to expect.
</p>

<p>I can't say thank you enough to the engineers at Sun who were
tremendously helpful in answering questions, keeping me updated on
changes in the Servlet API, and promptly fixing almost every bug I
reported: James Duncan Davidson (who looks the spitting image of
James Gosling), Jim Driscoll, Rob Clark, and Dave Brownell.
</p>

<p>Thanks also to the members of the <em class="email">jserv-interest
</em><a name="INDEX-39"></a><a name="INDEX-40"></a><a name="INDEX-41"></a> mailing list, whose questions
and answers have shaped the content of this book; Will Ramey, an old
friend who didn't let friendship blind his critical eye; Mike
Engber, the man to whom I turned when I had run out of elegant
workarounds and was ready to accept the crazy things he comes up
with; Dave Vandegrift, the first person to read many of the chapters;
Bill Day, author of <em class="emphasis">Java Media Players</em>, who
helped intangibly by going through the book writing process in
parallel with me; Michael O'Connell and Jill Steinberg, editors
at <em class="emphasis">JavaWorld</em>, where I did my first professional
writing; Doug Young, who shared with me the tricks he learned writing
seven technical books of his own; and Shoji Kuwabara, Mieko Aono,
Song Yung, Matthew Kim, and Alexandr Pashintsev for their help
translating "Hello World" for <a href="ch12_01.htm" webstripperlinkwas="http://ext.rlab.cs.nyu.edu/~jsr/oreilly/servlet/ch12_01.htm">Chapter 12, "Internationalization"</a>.
</p>

<p>Finally, thanks to Mom and Dad, for their love and support and for
the time they spent long ago teaching me the basics of writing. And a
special thanks to my girlfriend, Kristi Taylor, who made the small
time away from work a pleasure.
</p>

<p>And Grandpa, I wish you could have seen this.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">0.6.2. William Crawford</h3>

<p>First and foremost, thanks to Shelley Norton, Dr. Isaac Kohane, Dr.
James Fackler, and Dr. Richard Kitz (plus a supporting cast whose
contributions were invaluable), whose assistance and early support
have made everything since possible. Also, to Martin Streeter of
Invantage, Inc., for his support during this project.
</p>

<p>Without Rob Leith, Roger Stacey, and Fred Strebeigh, I would probably
still be stuck in the passive voice. Dale Dougherty offered me money
in exchange for words, a twist of events that I still haven't
gotten over. Andy Kwak, Joel Pomerantz, and Matthew Proto, brave
souls all, were willing to read drafts and listen to complaints at
one o'clock in the morning.
</p>

<p>And, of course, to Mom and Dad for their years of support, and to my
sister Faith for (usually) letting me get away with being a nerd.
