<!-- SECTION BODY --><h2 class="sect1">0.7. Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>      This book is an outgrowth of the best-selling <em class="emphasis">Java in a
      Nutshell</em>.  We'd like to thank all the readers who made
      that book a success and who wrote in with comments, suggestions,
      and praise.
    </p>
<p>      The authors would like to say a big thank you to the book's
      technical reviewers, whose constructive criticism has done
      much to improve this work: Andy Deitsch, Jason Hunter, 
      William Smith, and Gary Letourneau.
    </p>
<h3 class="sect2">0.7.1. David Flanagan</h3>
<p>
<em class="emphasis">Java Enterprise in a Nutshell</em> is a book I've wished 
	I could write for some time now.  Time constraints and my own lack 
	of expertise in enterprise computing have kept me from doing it 
	myself, and so I am deeply grateful to Jim Farley, William Crawford,
	and Kris Magnusson, who are experts and who did all the hard work 
	to make this book a reality.  I owe an extra thanks to Jim Farley 
	for taking the time to help me understand Enterprise JavaBeans and 
	the JTA and JTS transaction APIs.  Paula Ferguson also earns my 
	sincere thanks: she had the unenviable task of editing material 
	from four independent authors and fitting it seamlessly together 
	into a single book.   
      </p>
<h3 class="sect2">0.7.2. Jim Farley</h3>
<p>        A writing project of any kind requires a much larger cast of
	characters than those listed on the cover.  Paula Ferguson deserves
	mention above all, not only for doing her usual excellent editing 
	job, but also for roping in four disobedient authors, as opposed 
	to the usual one disobedient author.  I'd like to thank David 
	Flanagan for putting together the API listings and the introductory 
	chapter, as well as providing great technical review comments, 
	all of which helped integrate this into the "Java ... Nutshell" set.  
	Technical reviewers are the unsung heroes of writing projects such 
	as this one, so many thanks to Andy Deitsch, Bill Smith, Jason
	Hunter, and Gary Letourneau.
      </p>
<p>        To my wife Sandy Mallalieu, who has somehow not only accepted the 
	fact that her husband enjoys spending much of his free time on 
	writing projects like this, but is also supportive and inspiring 
	through it all--well, what else is there to say?  My extended 
	family, and the folks at the Harvard Business School, were 
	supportive as always, and getting through efforts such as this 
	makes me appreciate them both all the more.  And for the late-night 
	inspiration, my undying gratitude to Madeline and to Declan MacManus.
      </p>
<h3 class="sect2">0.7.3. William Crawford</h3>
<p>        Writing projects would be impossible without the support of 
	everyone at Invantage, especially Martin Streeter, Nicholas Riley, 
	and Stephen Braverman. Jason Hunter's knowledge of servlet 
	programming was a boon to Chapter 5. I would also like to thank 
	the staff of the Emotion Cybernet Cafe in Hanoi, Vietnam, where 
	I wrote most of the class summaries for the 
	<tt class="literal">java.sql</tt> package, paying six cents a minute 
	for computer time. And we wouldn't be here without David Flanagan.
      </p>
<p>        I have enjoyed support, encouragement, and grudging tolerance from 
	William F. Crawford, William E. Crawford, Francine Crawford, and 
	Faith Crawford, as well as from Joel Pomerantz, Sam Carner, and 
	Isaac Kohane.
      </p>
<p>        Finally, my heartfelt thanks goes to our editor, Paula Ferguson, 
	for her extreme patience with me over the last year and a half.
      </p>
<h3 class="sect2">0.7.4. Kris Magnusson</h3>
<p>        I found a good deal of pleasure in writing the JNDI-related material
	for this book. And I have many people to thank for the 
	opportunity--too many to list here. But some deserve special 
	mention.
      </p>
<p>        In particular I thank my partner and wife Kristen Dalzen for all her
	support, without which my work would not have been possible. She is the
	Empress of the Blue People, and she has enriched my life beyond 
	description. She has been brave to bear the abandonment.
      </p>
<p>        At O'Reilly, David Flanagan provided invaluable assistance in writing my portions 
	of this book; clearly he is an asset to the entire Java 
	community. My editor, Paula Ferguson, was equally invaluable; she
	tightened up my language and code like a vise. And my other editor, 
	Mike Loukides, is a good 


sport for giving me time off from my 
	other book to work on this one.
      </p>
<p>        My Novell experience has been a period of immense personal growth for 
	me. My officemates Bruce "Stocks" Bergeson, Jim Sermersheim, and 
	Kent Boogert have been key players in that drama, as were Alan Landes,
	Alvin Tedjamulia, Chris Stone, Don Lavange, Don Thomas, Ed Lane, 
	Erni Messenger, Michael J. Simpson, Mike Flathers, Mike MacKay, 
	Ric Buhler, Scott Pead, Steve Holbrook, Steve Weitzeil, and Trisha 
	Turner. Here's to a fruitful second act.
      </p>
<p>        Outside of work, Don Yacktman and Dr. Sean Luke were instrumental 
	in sharing their object-oriented architecture expertise over the 
	years. And Yan Fang and her support for my computer and other habits 
	helped immensely with my transition from fresh economics graduate 
	to software guy.
      </p>
<p>        Thanks, everyone!
      </p>
