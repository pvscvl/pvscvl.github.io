<!-- SECTION BODY --><h2 class="sect1">1.2. Key Benefits of Java</h2>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-46"></a>

      Why use Java at all?   Is it worth learning a new language and
      a new platform?  This section explores some of the key benefits of
      Java. </p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.1. Write Once, Run Anywhere</h3>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-47"></a>
	Sun identifies "Write once, run anywhere" as the
	core value proposition of the Java platform. Translated from business jargon, this means that the most
	important promise of Java technology is that you only have to write
	your application once--for the Java platform--and 
	then you'll be
	able to run it <em class="emphasis">anywhere</em>. </p>
<p>	Anywhere, that is, that supports the Java platform. Fortunately, Java support is becoming ubiquitous. It is
	integrated, or being integrated, into practically all major
	operating systems. It is built into the popular web browsers, which
	places it on virtually every Internet-connected PC in the world. It is even being built into consumer electronic devices, such as
	television set-top boxes, PDAs, and cell phones. </p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.2. Security</h3>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-48"></a>

	Another key benefit of Java is its security features. Both the
	language and the platform were designed from the ground up with
	security in mind. The Java platform allows users to download
	untrusted code over a network and run it in a secure
	environment in which it cannot do any harm: it cannot infect the
	host system with a virus, cannot read or write files from the
	hard drive, and so forth. This capability alone makes the Java
	platform unique. </p>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-49"></a><a name="INDEX-50"></a>

	The Java 2 Platform takes the security model a step further. It
	makes security levels and restrictions highly configurable and
	extends them beyond applets. As of Java 1.2, any Java code,
	whether it is an applet, a servlet, a JavaBeans component, or a
	complete Java application, can be run with restricted
	permissions that prevent it from doing harm to the host system. </p>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-51"></a>

	The security features of the Java language and platform
	have been subjected to intense scrutiny by security experts
	around the world. Security-related bugs, some of them
	potentially serious, have been found and promptly fixed. Because
	of the security promises Java makes, it is big news when a new
	security bug is found. Remember, however, that no other
	mainstream platform can make security guarantees nearly as
	strong as those Java makes. If Java's security is not yet
	perfect, it has been proven strong enough for practical
	day-to-day use and is certainly better than any of the
	alternatives. </p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.3. Network-centric Programming</h3>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-52"></a><a name="INDEX-53"></a>

	Sun's corporate motto has always been "The network is the
	computer." The designers of the Java platform believed in
	the importance of networking and designed the Java platform to
	be network-centric. From a programmer's point of view, Java
	makes it unbelievably easy to work with resources across a
	network and to create network-based applications using
	client/server or multitier architectures. This means that Java
	programmers have a serious head start in the emerging network
	economy. </p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.4. Dynamic, Extensible Programs</h3>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-54"></a>

	Java is both dynamic and extensible. Java code is organized
	in modular object-oriented units called
	<em class="emphasis">classes</em>. Classes are stored in separate
	files and are loaded into the Java interpreter only when needed. This means that an application can decide as it is running what
	classes it needs and can load them when it needs them. It also
	means that a program can dynamically extend itself by loading
	the classes it needs to expand its functionality. </p>
<p>	The network-centric design of the Java platform means that a
	Java application can dynamically extend itself by loading new
	classes over a network. An application that takes advantage of
	these features ceases to be a monolithic block of code. Instead, it becomes an interacting collection of independent
	

 
	software components. Thus, Java
	enables a powerful new metaphor of application design and
	development. </p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.5. Internationalization</h3>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-55"></a><a name="INDEX-56"></a><a name="INDEX-57"></a>

	The Java language and the Java platform were designed from the
	start with the rest of the world in mind. Java is the only
	commonly used programming language that has internationalization
	features at its very core, rather than tacked on as an
	afterthought. While most programming languages use 8-bit
	characters that represent only the alphabets of English and
	Western European languages, Java uses 16-bit Unicode characters
	that represent the phonetic alphabets and ideographic character
	sets of the entire world. Java's
	internationalization features are not restricted to just
	low-level character representation, however. The
	features permeate the
	Java platform, making it easier to write internationalized
	programs with Java than it is with any other environment. </p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.6. Performance</h3>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-58"></a><a name="INDEX-59"></a><a name="INDEX-60"></a><a name="INDEX-61"></a><a name="INDEX-62"></a><a name="INDEX-63"></a><a name="INDEX-64"></a>

	As I described earlier, Java programs are compiled to a
	portable intermediate form known as byte codes, rather than to
	native machine-language instructions. The Java Virtual Machine
	runs a Java program by interpreting these portable byte-code
	instructions. This architecture means that Java programs are
	faster than programs or scripts written in purely interpreted
	languages, but they are typically slower than C and C++ programs
	compiled to native machine language. Keep in mind,
	however, that although Java programs are compiled to byte code,
	not all of the Java platform is implemented with interpreted
	byte codes. For efficiency, computationally intensive portions
	of the Java platform--such as the string-manipulation
	methods--are implemented using native machine code. </p>
<p>	Although early releases of Java suffered from performance
	problems, the speed of the Java VM has improved dramatically
	with each new release. The VM has been highly tuned and
	optimized in many significant ways. Furthermore, many
	implementations include a just-in-time compiler, which converts
	Java byte codes to native machine instructions on the fly. Using sophisticated JIT compilers, Java programs can execute at
	speeds comparable to the speeds of native C and C++
	applications. </p>
<p> 
	Java is a portable, interpreted language; Java programs run
	almost as fast as native, non-portable C and C++ programs. Performance used to be an issue that made some programmers avoid
	using Java. Now, with the improvements made in Java 1.2,
	performance issues should no longer keep anyone away. In fact,
	the winning combination of performance plus portability is a
	unique feature no other language can offer. </p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.7. Programmer Efficiency and Time-to-Market</h3>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-65"></a>

	The final, and perhaps most important, reason to use Java is
	that programmers like it. Java is an elegant language combined
	with a powerful and well-designed set of APIs. Programmers
	enjoy programming in Java and are usually amazed at how quickly
	they can get results with it. Studies have consistently shown
	that switching to Java increases programmer efficiency. Because
	Java is a simple and elegant language with a well-designed,
	intuitive set of APIs, programmers write better code with fewer
	bugs than for other platforms, again reducing
	development time.
