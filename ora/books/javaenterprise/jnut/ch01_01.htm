    Welcome to Java. Since its introduction in late 1995, the Java
    language and platform have taken the programming world by
    storm. This chapter begins by explaining what Java is and why it has
    become so popular. Then, as a tutorial introduction to the
    language, it walks you through a simple Java program you can
    type in, compile, and run. </p>
<h2 class="sect1">1.1. What Is Java?</h2>
<p>      In discussing Java, it is important to distinguish between the
      Java programming language, the Java Virtual Machine, and the Java
      platform. The Java programming language is the language in which
      Java applications (including applets, servlets, and JavaBeans
      components) are written. When a Java program is
      compiled, it is converted to byte codes that are
      the portable machine language of a CPU architecture known as the
      Java Virtual Machine (also called the Java VM or JVM). The JVM
      can be implemented directly in hardware, but it is usually
      implemented in the form of a software program that
      interprets and executes byte codes. </p>
<p>      The Java platform is distinct from both the Java language and Java
      VM. The Java platform 
      is the predefined set of Java classes that exist on every Java
      installation; these classes are available for use by all Java
      programs. The Java platform is also sometimes referred to as the
      Java runtime environment or the core Java APIs (application 
      programming interfaces). The Java platform can 
      be extended with optional standard extensions. These extension
      APIs exist in some Java installations, but are not guaranteed to
      exist in all installations. </p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.1. The Java Programming Language</h3>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-14"></a>


	The Java programming language is a state-of-the-art,
	object-oriented language that has a syntax similar to
	that of C. The language designers strove to make the Java language
	powerful, but, at the same time, they tried to avoid the overly complex
	features that have bogged down other object-oriented
	languages, such as C++. By keeping the language simple, the
	designers also made it easier for programmers to write robust,
	bug-free code. As a result of its elegant design and next-generation
	features, the Java language has proved wildly popular
	with programmers, who typically find it a pleasure to work
	with Java after struggling with more difficult, less
	powerful languages.
<a name="INDEX-15"></a><a name="INDEX-16"></a>
</p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.2. The Java Virtual Machine</h3>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-17"></a><a name="INDEX-18"></a><a name="INDEX-19"></a><a name="INDEX-20"></a>

	The Java Virtual Machine, or Java interpreter, is the crucial
	piece of every Java installation. By design, Java programs are
	portable, but they are only portable to platforms to which a Java
	interpreter has been ported. Sun ships VM implementations for
	its own Solaris operating system and for Microsoft Windows (95/98/NT)
	platforms. Many other vendors, including Apple and various Unix
	vendors, provide Java interpreters for their platforms. There is
	a freely available port of Sun's VM for Linux platforms, and
	there are also other third-party VM implementations available. The Java VM is not only for desktop systems, however. It has been ported
	to set-top boxes, and versions are even available for hand-held
	devices that run Windows CE and PalmOS. </p>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-21"></a><a name="INDEX-22"></a>

	Although interpreters are not typically considered
	high-performance systems, Java VM performance is remarkably
	good and has been improving steadily. Of particular note is a
	VM technology called just-in-time ( JIT) compilation, whereby
	Java byte codes are converted on-the-fly into native-platform
	machine language, boosting execution speed for code that is run
	repeatedly. Sun's new Hotspot technology is a
	particularly good implementation of JIT compilation. </p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.3. The Java Platform</h3>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-23"></a><a name="INDEX-24"></a><a name="INDEX-25"></a><a name="INDEX-26"></a>

	The Java platform is just as important as the Java 
	programming language and the Java Virtual
	Machine. All programs written in the Java language rely on
	the set of predefined 
	classes<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> that comprise the Java platform. Java classes are organized into related groups
	known as <em class="emphasis">packages</em>. The Java platform
	defines packages for functionality such as input/output, networking,
	graphics, user-interface creation, security, and much more. </p>
<blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-1"></a>
<p>[1]A <em class="emphasis">class</em> is 
	a module of Java
	code that defines a data structure and a set of methods (also 
	called procedures, functions, or subroutines) that operate on that
	data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>	The Java 1.2 release was a major milestone for the Java
	platform. This release almost tripled the number of classes
	in the platform and introduced significant new functionality. In recognition of this, Sun named the new version the
	Java 2 Platform. This is a trademarked name
	created for marketing purposes; it serves to emphasize how much
	Java has grown since its first release. However, most programmers
	refer to the Java platform by its official version number,
	which, at the time of this writing, is 1.2.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a>
</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-2"></a>
<p>[2]Although
	there is currently a beta release of Java 1.3 
	available</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-27"></a><a name="INDEX-28"></a>

	It is important to understand what is meant by the term
	platform. To a computer programmer, a platform is defined by
	the APIs he or she can rely on when writing
	programs. These APIs are usually defined by the
	operating system of the target computer. Thus, a programmer
	writing a program to run under Microsoft Windows must use a
	different set of APIs than a programmer writing the same program
	for the Macintosh or for a Unix-based
	system. In this respect, 
	Windows, Macintosh, and Unix are three distinct platforms. </p>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-29"></a>

	Java is not an operating system.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a> Nevertheless, the Java
	platform--particularly the 
	Java 2 Platform--provides APIs with a
	comparable breadth and depth to those defined by an operating
	system. With the Java 2 Platform, you can 
	write applications in Java without sacrificing the
	advanced features available to programmers writing
	native applications targeted at a particular underlying
	operating system. An application written on the Java platform runs on any
	operating system that supports the Java platform. This means
	you do not have to create distinct Windows,
	Macintosh, and Unix versions of your programs, for example. A single Java
	program runs on all these operating systems, which explains
	why "Write once, run anywhere" is Sun's motto for
	Java.</p>
<blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-3"></a>
<p>[3]There is a
	Java-based operating system, however; it is known as
	JavaOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>	It also explains why companies like Microsoft might feel
	threatened by Java. The Java platform is not an operating
	system, but for programmers, it is an alternative development
	target and a very popular one at that. The Java platform
	reduces programmers' reliance on the underlying operating
	system, and, by allowing programs to run on top of any operating
	system, it increases end users' freedom to choose an operating
	system. </p>
<h3 class="sect2">1.1.4. Versions of Java</h3>
<p>	As of this writing, there have been four major versions of
	Java. They are:

	</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Java 1.0</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-30"></a>

		This was the first public version of Java. It contained
		212 classes organized in 8 packages. There is a large
		installed base of web browsers that run this version of
		Java, so this version is still in use for writing simple
		applets--Java programs that are included in web
		pages. (See <em class="emphasis">Java Foundation Classes in a
		Nutshell</em> (O'Reilly) for a discussion of applets.)
	      </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Java 1.1</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-31"></a>

		This release of Java doubled the size of the Java
		platform to 504 classes in 23 packages. It
		introduced inner classes, an important change to the
		Java language itself, and included significant
		performance improvements in the Java VM. This
		version of Java is out of date, but is still in use on
		systems that do not yet have a stable port of Java
		1.2. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Java 1.2</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-32"></a>

		This is the latest and greatest significant 
		release of Java; it
		tripled the size of the Java platform to 1520 classes in
		59 packages. Because of the many new features included
		in this release, the platform was renamed and is now 
		called the Java 2 Platform. </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Java 1.3 (beta)</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-33"></a>

		This release includes minor corrections and updates 
		to the Java platform, but does not
		include major changes or significant new functionality. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-34"></a>

	In addition, Sun has
	instituted a process for proposing and developing standard
	extensions to the Java platform. In the future, most new
	functionality is expected to take the form of a standard extension,
	rather than be a required part of every Java installation. </p>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-35"></a><a name="INDEX-36"></a><a name="INDEX-37"></a><a name="INDEX-38"></a>

	In order to work with Java 1.0 or Java 1.1, you have to
	obtain the Java Development Kit ( JDK) for that release. As of Java 1.2, the JDK has been renamed and is now called
	a Software Development Kit (SDK), so we have the Java 2 SDK 
	or, more precisely, the Java 2 SDK, Standard
	Edition, Version 1.2 (or Version 1.3 beta). Despite the new name, many programmers
	still refer to the development kit as the JDK. </p>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-39"></a><a name="INDEX-40"></a><a name="INDEX-41"></a>


	Don't confuse the JDK (or SDK) with the Java Runtime Environment 
	( JRE). The JRE contains everything you need to run Java programs, but
	does not contain the tools you need
	to develop Java programs (i.e., the compiler). You should also be aware of the Java
	Plug-in, a version of the Java 1.2 (and 1.3) JRE that is 
	designed to be
	integrated into the Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
	Internet Explorer web browsers. </p>
<p>
<a name="INDEX-42"></a><a name="INDEX-43"></a><a name="INDEX-44"></a><a name="INDEX-45"></a>

	In addition to evolving the Java platform over time, Sun is also
	trying to produce different versions of the platform for
	different uses. The Standard Edition is the 
	only version currently available, but Sun is also working on 
	the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition ( J2EE), for 
	enterprise developers and the Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition, 
	for consumer electronic
	systems, like handheld PDAs and cellular telephones. </p>
