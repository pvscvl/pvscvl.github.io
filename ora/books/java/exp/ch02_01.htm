<a name="CH02.APPLETSEX"></A>Before we turn our attention to the details of the
language, let's take a crash course and jump right into some
Java code. In this chapter, we'll build a contrived but
friendly little applet that illustrates a number of techniques we
use throughout the book. I'll take this opportunity to
introduce general features of the Java language and of Java
applets. However, many details won't be fleshed out here, but in
subsequent chapters.

<p class=para>
This chapter also serves as a brief introduction to the object-oriented and multithreaded features of Java. If these concepts are
new to you, you can take comfort in the knowledge that encountering
them for the first time in Java should be a straightforward and
pleasant experience. If you have worked with another object-oriented
or multithreaded programming environment, clear your mind; you will
especially appreciate Java's simplicity and elegance.

<p class=para>
I can't stress enough the importance of experimentation as you
learn new concepts. If you follow along with the online examples, be
sure to take some time and compile them locally. Play with them;
change their behavior, break them, fix them, and, as Java developer
Arthur van Hoff would say: "Have fun!"

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-SECT-1">2.1 Hello Web!</A></h2>

<p class=para>
In the tradition of all good introductory programming texts, we begin
with Java's equivalent of the archetypal "Hello
World" application. In the spirit of our new world, we'll
call it "Hello Web!"

<p class=para>
I'll take four passes at this example, adding features and
introducing new concepts along the way. Here's a
minimalist version:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public class HelloWeb extends java.applet.Applet { 
    public void paint( java.awt.Graphics gc ) { 
        gc.drawString("Hello Web!", 125, 95 ); 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Place this text in a file called <i class=filename>HelloWeb.java</i>.
Now compile this source:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
% javac HelloWeb.java 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This produces the Java byte-code binary class file
<i class=filename>HelloWeb.class</i>.

<p class=para>
We need an HTML document that contains the
appropriate <tt class=literal>&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag to display our example.
Place the following text in a file called
<i class=filename>HelloWeb.html</i> in the same directory as the binary
class file:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;html&gt; 
&lt;head&gt; 
&lt;/head&gt; 
&lt;body&gt; 
    &lt;applet code=HelloWeb width=300 height=200&gt;&lt;/applet&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt; 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Finally, you can point your Java-enabled Web browser at this document with 
a URL such as: 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://yourServer/wherever/HelloWeb.html
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
or

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
file:/wherever/HelloWeb.html
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
You should see the proclamation shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-2-FIG-1">Figure 2.1</A>. Now congratulate yourself: you have
written your first applet! Take a moment to bask in the glow of your
monitor.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-FIG-1">Figure 2.1: Hello Web! applet</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0201.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 2-1]" width=503 height=263 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> may be a small program, but there is
actually quite a bit going on behind the scenes. Those five lines
represent the tip of an iceberg. What lies under the surface are
layers of functionality provided by the Java language and its
foundation class libraries. In this chapter, I'll cover a lot
of ground quickly in an effort to show you the big picture.
I'll try to offer enough detail for a complete understanding of
what is happening in each example without exhaustive
explanations until the appropriate chapters. This holds for both
elements of the Java language and the object-oriented concepts that
apply to them. Later chapters will provide more detailed cataloging
of Java's syntax, components, and object-oriented features.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-SECT-1.1">Classes</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH02.CLASSES"></A>The previous example defines a <i class=emphasis>class</I> named
<tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt>. Classes are the fundamental building
blocks of most object-oriented languages. A class in Java is akin to
the C++ concept of a class. Specifically, it's a group of data items
(&agrave; la a C struct), with associated functions that perform
operations on this data. The data items in a class are called
<i class=emphasis>fields</I> or <i class=emphasis>variables</I>&nbsp;;
the functions are called <i class=emphasis>methods</I>. A class might
represent something concrete, like a button on a screen or the
information in a spreadsheet, or it could be something more abstract,
such as a sorting algorithm or possibly the sense of ennui in your
MUD character. A hypothetical spreadsheet class
might, for example, have variables that represent the values of its
individual cells and methods that perform operations on those cells,
such as "clear a row" or "compute values."

<p class=para>
Our <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> class is the container for our Java
applet. It holds two general types of variables and methods: those we
need for our specific applet's tasks and some special
predesignated ones we provide to interact with the outside world. The
Java run-time environment, in this case a Java-enabled Web browser,
periodically calls methods in <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> to pass us
information and prod us to perform actions, as depicted in <a href="#EXJ-CH-2-FIG-2">Figure 2.2</A>. Our simple <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt>
class defines a single method called <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>. The
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method is called by Java when it's time
for our application to draw itself on the screen.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-FIG-2">Figure 2.2: Method invocation in the Java environment</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0202.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 2-2]" width=503 height=163 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
You will see that the <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> class derives some
of its structure from another class called <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>.
This is why we refer to <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> as an applet.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-SECT-1.2">Class Instances and Objects</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A class represents a particular thing; it contains methods and
variables that assist in that representation. Many individual working
copies of a given class can exist while an application is
active. These individual incarnations are called
<i class=emphasis>instances</I> of the class. Two instances of a given
class may contain different states, but they always have the same
methods.

<p class=para>
As an example, consider a <tt class=literal>Button</tt> class. There is
only one <tt class=literal>Button</tt> class, but many actual working
instances of buttons can be in an application. Furthermore, two
<tt class=literal>Button</tt> instances might contain different data,
perhaps giving each a different appearance or specifying a different
message for each to send when pushed. In this sense, a class can
be considered a mold for making the object it represents:
something like a cookie cutter stamping out working instances of
itself in the memory of the computer. As you'll see later,
there's a bit more to it than that--a class can in fact
share information among its instances--but this
explanation suffices for now.

<p class=para>
The term <i class=emphasis>object</I> is very general and in some other
contexts is used almost interchangeably with class. Objects are the
abstract entities all object-oriented languages refer to in one
form or another. I will use object as a generic term for an instance
of a class. I might, therefore, refer to an instance of the
<tt class=literal>Button</tt> class as a <tt class=literal>Button</tt>, a
<tt class=literal>Button</tt> object, or, indiscriminately, as an object.

<p class=para>
A Java-enabled Web browser creates an instance of our
<tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> class when we first use our applet. If we
had included the <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> applet tag in our
HTML document twice (causing it to appear twice on
the screen), the browser would create and manage two separate
HelloWeb objects (two separate instances of the
<tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> class).

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-SECT-1.3">Variables</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH02.VARIABLES"></A>In Java, every class defines a new <i class=emphasis>type</I>. A
variable can be of this type and then hold
instances of that class. A variable could, for example, be of type
<tt class=literal>Button</tt> and hold an instance of the
<tt class=literal>Button</tt> class, or of type
<tt class=literal>SpreadSheetCell</tt> and hold a
<tt class=literal>SpreadSheetCell</tt> object, just as it could be any of the more familiar types such as <tt class=literal>integer</tt> or
<tt class=literal>float</tt>. In this way, by having variables containing
complex objects, a class may use other classes as tools within itself.
Using classes in this way is called <i class=emphasis>composition</I>.
 Our examples in
this chapter are somewhat unrealistic in that we are building only a
single class of our own. However, we will be using many classes as
tools within our applet.

<p class=para>
You have seen only one variable so far in our simple
<tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> example. It's found in the declaration
of our lonely <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public void paint( java.awt.Graphics gc ) {...} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Just like functions in C (and many other languages), a method in Java
declares a list of variables that hold its arguments, and it
specifies the types of those arguments. Our
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method takes one argument named (somewhat
tersely) <tt class=literal>gc</tt>, which is of type
<tt class=literal>Graphics</tt>. When the
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method is invoked, a
<tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object is assigned to
<tt class=literal>gc</tt>, which we use in the body of the method. I'll
say more about <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> and the
<tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class in a moment.

<p class=para>
But first, a few words about variables. I have loosely
referred to variables as holding objects. In reality, variables that
have complex types (class types) don't so much contain objects as
point to them. Class-type variables are
<i class=emphasis>references</I> to objects. A reference is a pointer
to, or another name for, an object.

<p class=para>
 
Simply declaring a variable doesn't imply that any storage is
allocated for that variable or that an instance of its type even
exists anywhere. When a reference-type variable is first declared, if
it's not assigned to an instance of a class, it doesn't point to
anything. It's assigned the default value of 
<tt class=literal>null</tt>, meaning
"no value." If you try to use a variable with a
<tt class=literal>null</tt> value as if it were pointing to a real object,
a run-time error (NullPointerException) occurs.

<p class=para>
This discussion begs the question as to where to get an instance of a
class to assign to a variable in the first place. The answer, as you
will see later, is through the use of the <tt class=literal>new</tt>
operator.
In our first two passes at this example, we are dealing
only with objects handed to us prefabricated from somewhere
outside of our class. We examine object creation later in the
chapter.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-SECT-1.4">Inheritance</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java classes are arranged in a parent-child hierarchy, in which the
parent and child are known as the <i class=emphasis>superclass</I> and
<i class=emphasis>subclass</I>, respectively. In Java, every class has
exactly one superclass (a single parent), but possibly many
subclasses. Of course, a class's superclass probably has its own
superclass.

<p class=para>
The declaration of our class in the previous example uses the keyword
<tt class=literal>extends</tt> to specify that <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt>
is a subclass of the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public class HelloWeb extends java.applet.Applet {...}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
A subclass may be allowed to inherit some or all of the variables and
methods of its superclass. Through <i class=emphasis>inheritance</I>,
the subclass can use those members as if it has declared them itself.
A subclass can add variables and methods of its own, and it can also
override the meaning of inherited variables and methods. When we use
a subclass, overridden variables and methods are hidden
(replaced) by the subclass's own versions of them. In this way,
inheritance provides a powerful mechanism whereby a subclass can
refine or extend its superclass.

<p class=para>
For example, the hypothetical spreadsheet class might be subclassed to
produce a new scientific spreadsheet class with extra mathematical
functions and special built-in constants. In this case, the source
code for the scientific spreadsheet might declare methods for the
added mathematical functions and variables for the special constants,
but the new class automatically has all the variables and methods that
constitute the normal functionality of a spreadsheet; they are
inherited from the parent spreadsheet class. This means the scientific
spreadsheet maintains its identity as a spreadsheet, and we can use it
anywhere the simpler spreadsheet is used.

<p class=para>
Our <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> class is a subclass of the
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class and inherits many variables and
methods not explicitly declared in our source code.
These members function in the same way as the ones we add
or override.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-SECT-1.5">Applet</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class provides the framework for
building applets. It contains methods that support the basic
functionality for a Java application that is displayed and
controlled by a Java-enabled Web browser or other Java-enabled
software.

<p class=para>
We override methods in the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class in a
subclass to implement the behavior of our particular applet. This may
sound restrictive, as if we are limited to some predefined set of
routines, but that is not the case at all. Keep in mind that the
methods we are talking about are means of getting information from the
outside world. A realistic application might involve hundreds or even
thousands of classes, with legions of methods and variables and
multiple threads of execution. The vast majority of these are related
to the particulars of our job. The inherited methods of the
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class, and of other special components,
serve as a framework on which to hang code that handles
certain types of events and performs special tasks.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method is an important method of the
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class; we override it to implement the way
in which our particular applet displays itself on the screen. We
don't override any of the other inherited members of
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> because they provide basic functionality and
reasonable defaults for this (trivial) example. As
<tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> grows, we'll delve deeper into the
inherited members and override additional methods. Inherited members
will allow us to get information from the user and give us more
control over what our applet does. We will also add some
arbitrary, application-specific methods and variables for the needs
of <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt>.

<p class=para>
If you want to verify for yourself what functionality the
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class is providing our example, you can try
out the world's least interesting applet: the
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> base class itself. Just use the class name
<tt class=literal>java.applet.Applet</tt> in your HTML
code, instead of <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt>:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;applet code=java.applet.Applet width=300 height=200&gt;&lt;/applet&gt; 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
You should get a blank area of screen. I told you it's not very
interesting.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-SECT-1.6">Relationships and Finger Pointing</A></h3>

<p class=para>
We can correctly refer to <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> as an
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> because subclassing can be thought of as
creating an "is a" relationship, in which the subclass is
a kind of its superclass. <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> is therefore a
kind of <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>. When we refer to a kind of object,
we mean any instance of that object's class or any of its
subclasses.
Later, we will look more closely at the Java class hierarchy and see
that <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> is itself a subclass of the
<tt class=literal>Panel</tt> class, which is further derived from a class
called <tt class=literal>Container</tt>, and so on, as shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-2-FIG-3">Figure 2.3</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-FIG-3">Figure 2.3: Part of the Java class hierarchy</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0203.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 2-3]" width=503 height=263 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
In this sense, an <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> is a kind of
<tt class=literal>Panel</tt>, which is, itself, a kind of
<tt class=literal>Container</tt> and each of these can ultimately be
considered to be a kind of <tt class=literal>Component</tt>. You'll
see later that it's from these classes that <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>
inherits its basic graphical user interface functionality and the
ability to have other graphical components embedded within it.

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>Component</tt> is a subclass of
<tt class=literal>Object</tt>, so all of these classes are a kind of
<tt class=literal>Object</tt>. As you'll see later, the
<tt class=literal>Object</tt> class is at the top of the Java class
hierarchy; <tt class=literal>Object</tt> doesn't have a superclass.
Every other class in the Java API inherits behavior from
<tt class=literal>Object</tt>, which defines a few basic methods, as
you'll see in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, <i>Objects in Java</i></A>. The terminology here
can become a bit muddled. I'll continue to use the word "object"
(lowercase o) in a generic way to refer to an instance of any class;
I'll use <tt class=literal>Object</tt> to refer specifically to that
class.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-SECT-1.7">Packages</A></h3>

<p class=para>
In our previous example, the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class
is referenced by its fully qualified name
<tt class=literal>java.applet.Applet</tt>:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public class HelloWeb extends java.applet.Applet {...} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The prefix on the class name identifies it as belonging to the
<tt class=literal>java.applet</tt> package. Packages provide a means for
organizing Java classes. A <i class=emphasis>package</I> is a group of
Java classes that are related by purpose or by application. Classes
in the same package have special access privileges with respect to
one another and may be designed to work together. Package names are
hierarchical and are used somewhat like Internet domain
and host names, to distinguish groups of classes by organization and
application. Classes may be dynamically loaded over networks from
arbitrary locations; within this context, packages provide a crude
namespace of Java classes.[1]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
 
 
There are many efforts under way to find a
general solution to the problem of locating resources in a globally
distributed computing environment. The Uniform Resource Identifier
Working Group of the IETF has proposed Uniform
Resource Names (URNs). A URN
would be a more abstract and persistent identifier that would be
resolved to a URL through the use of a name
service. We can imagine a day when there will exist a global
namespace of trillions of persistent objects forming the
infrastructure for all computing resources. Java provides an
important evolutionary step in this direction.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>java.applet</tt> identifies a particular package that
contains classes related to
applets. <tt class=literal>java.applet.Applet</tt> identifies a specific
class, the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class, within that package. The
<tt class=literal>java.</tt> hierarchy is special. Any package that
begins with <tt class=literal>java.</tt> is part of the core Java API and
is available on any platform that supports Java. 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-2-FIG-4">Figure 2.4</A>
illustrates the core Java packages, showing a representative class or
two from each package.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-FIG-4">Figure 2.4: The core Java packages</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0204.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 2-4]" width=503 height=288 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Some notable core packages include: <tt class=literal>java.lang</tt>,
which contains fundamental classes needed by the Java language itself;
<tt class=literal>java.awt</tt>, which contains classes of the Java
Abstract Windowing Toolkit; and <tt class=literal>java.net</tt>, which
contains the networking classes.

<p class=para>
A few classes contain methods that are not written in Java, but are
instead part of the native Java implementation on
a particular platform. Approximately 22 such classes are in the
<tt class=literal>java</tt> package hierarchy; these are the only
classes that have to be ported to a new platform. They form the
basis for all interaction with the operating system. All other
classes are built on or around these and are completely platform
independent.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-2-SECT-1.8">The paint(&nbsp;) Method</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The source for our <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> class defines just one
method, <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>, which overrides the
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method from the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>
class:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public void paint( java.awt.Graphics gc ) { 
    gc.drawString("Hello Web!", 125, 95 ); 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method is called by Java when it's
time for our applet to draw itself on the screen. It takes a single
argument, a <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object, and doesn't return
any type of value (<tt class=literal>void</tt>) to its caller.

<p class=para>
<i class=emphasis>Modifiers</I> are keywords placed before classes,
variables, and methods to alter their accessibility, behavior, or
semantics. <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> is declared as
<tt class=literal>public</tt>, which means it can be invoked (called)
by methods in classes other than <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt>. In this
case, it's the Java windowing environment that is calling our
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method. A method or variable declared as
<tt class=literal>private</tt> is inaccessible from outside of its class.

<p class=para>
 
The <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object, an instance of the
<tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class, represents a particular graphical
drawing area and is also called a graphics context. It contains
methods the applet calls to draw in this area, and variables that
represent characteristics such as clipping or drawing modes. The
particular <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object we are passed in the
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method corresponds to our applet's
area of the screen.

<p class=para>
 
The <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class provides methods for rendering
primitive shapes, images, and text. In <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt>, we
invoke the <tt class=literal>drawString()</tt> method of our
<tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object to scrawl our message at the
specified coordinates. (For a description of the methods available in
the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class, see <a href="ch13_01.htm">Chapter 13, <i>Drawing With the AWT</i></A>.)

<p class=para>
As in C++, a method or variable of an object is accessed in a
hierarchical way by appending its name with a "." (dot) to
the object that holds it. We invoked the
<tt class=literal>drawString()</tt> method of the
<tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object (referenced by our
<tt class=literal>gc</tt> variable) in this way:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
