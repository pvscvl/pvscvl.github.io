<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-6-SECT-2">6.2 Threading Applets</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH06.APPLETS"></A>Applets are embeddable Java applications that are expected to be able
to start and stop themselves on command. Unlike threads, applets can
be started and stopped any number of times. A Java-enabled Web browser
normally starts an applet when the applet is displayed and stops it
when the user moves to another page or scrolls the applet out of
view. In general, we would like an applet to cease its nonessential
activity when it is stopped, and resume it when started
again. (See <a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, <i>Understand the Abstract Windowing Toolkit</i></A> for a complete discussion of
applets.)

<p class=para>
In this section, we will build <tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt>, a
simple base class for an <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> that maintains a
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt> to automatically update its display at
regular intervals. <tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt> handles the basic
starting and stopping behavior for us, as shown below.

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public class UpdateApplet extends java.applet.Applet 
    implements Runnable { 
    
    private Thread updateThread; 
    int updateInterval = 1000; 
 
    public void run() { 
        while ( true ) { 
            try {   
                Thread.sleep( updateInterval );  
            }  
            catch (InterruptedException e ) { } 
 
            repaint(); 
        } 
    } 
 
    public void start() { 
        if ( updateThread == null ) { 
            updateThread = new Thread(this); 
            updateThread.start(); 
        } 
    } 
 
    public void stop() { 
        if ( updateThread != null ) { 
            updateThread.stop(); 
            updateThread = null; 
        } 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt> is a <tt class=literal>Runnable</tt>
object that alternately sleeps and calls its
<tt class=literal>repaint()</tt> method. It has two other public methods:
<tt class=literal>start()</tt> and <tt class=literal>stop()</tt>. These are
methods of the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class we are overriding;
do not confuse them with the similarly named methods of the
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt> class. These <tt class=literal>start()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>stop()</tt> methods are called by the Java environment
to tell the applet when it should and should not be running.

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt> illustrates an environmentally
friendly way to deal with threads in a simple
applet. <tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt> kills its thread each time the
applet is stopped and recreates it if the applet is restarted. When
<tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt>'s <tt class=literal>start()</tt>
method is called, we first check to make sure there is no
currently executing <tt class=literal>updateThread</tt>. We then create
one to begin our execution. When our applet is subsequently stopped,
we kill the thread by invoking its <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> method
and throw away the reference by setting it to <tt class=literal>null</tt>.
Setting <tt class=literal>updateThread</tt> 
to <tt class=literal>null</tt> serves both to allow the garbage collector to 
clean up the dead <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> object, and to indicate to 
<tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt>'s <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method 
that the thread is gone.

<p class=para>
In truth, an <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>start()</tt> and <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> methods are
guaranteed to be called in sequence. As a result, we
shouldn't have to check for the existence of
<tt class=literal>updateThread</tt> in <tt class=literal>start()</tt> (it
should always be <tt class=literal>null</tt>). However, it's good
programming practice to perform the test. If we didn't, and for
some reason <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> were to fail at its job, we
might inadvertently start a lot of threads.

<p class=para>
With <tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt> 
doing all of the work for us, we can now create the world's simplest 
clock applet with just a few lines of code. <a href="#EXJ-CH-6-FIG-3">Figure 6.3</A> shows our <tt class=literal>Clock</tt>. 
(This might be a good one to run on your Java wrist watch.)

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public class Clock extends UpdateApplet { 
    public void paint( java.awt.Graphics g ) { 
        g.drawString( new java.util.Date().toString(), 10, 25 ); 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-6-FIG-3">Figure 6.3: The clock applet</A></h4>


<p>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>java.util.Date().toString()</tt> sequence 
simply creates a string that contains the current time; we'll see 
where this code comes from in <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, <i>Basic Utility Classes</i></A>.

<p class=para>
Our <tt class=literal>Clock</tt> applet provides a good example of a
simple thread; we don't mind throwing it away and subsequently
rebuilding it if the user should happen to wander on and off of our
Web page a few times. But what if the task that our thread handles
isn't so simple? What if, for instance, we have to open a socket
and establish a connection with another system? One solution is to use
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt>'s <tt class=literal>suspend()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>resume()</tt> methods, as I'll show you
momentarily.

<p class=para>
 
 
Now if you've been wondering why we've been using
<tt class=literal>stop()</tt> to kill the thread, rather than using the
<tt class=literal>suspend()</tt> and <tt class=literal>resume()</tt> methods
all along, here's the explanation you've been waiting
for. The problem with applets is that we have no control over how a
user navigates Web pages. For example, say a user scrolls our applet
out of view, and we use <tt class=literal>suspend()</tt> to suspend the
applet. Now we have no way of ensuring that the user will bring the
applet back into view before moving on to another page. And actually,
the same situation would occur if the user simply moves on to another
page and never comes back.

<p class=para>
If we call <tt class=literal>suspend()</tt>, we'd really like to
make sure we call <tt class=literal>resume()</tt> at a later date, or
we'll end up leaving the thread hanging in permanent
suspense. But we have no way of knowing if the applet will ever be
restarted, so just putting a call to <tt class=literal>resume()</tt> in
the applet's <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method won't
work. Leaving the suspended thread around forever might not hurt us,
but it's not good programming practice to be wasteful.  What we
need is a way to guarantee we can clean up our mess if the applet
is never used again. What to do?

<p class=para>
There is a solution for this dilemma, but in many cases, like with our
simple <tt class=literal>Clock</tt>, it's just easier to use
<tt class=literal>stop()</tt>, with a subsequent call to
<tt class=literal>start()</tt> if necessary. In cases where it is
expensive to set up and tear down a thread, we could make the
following modifications to <tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt>:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public void start() { 
    if ( updateThread == null ) { 
        updateThread = new Thread(this); 
        updateThread.start(); 
    } 
    else 
        updateThread.resume(); 
} 
 
public void stop() { 
    updateThread.suspend(); 
 
public void destroy() { 
    if ( updateThread != null ) { 
        updateThread.stop(); 
        updateThread = null; 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
These modifications change <tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt> so that it
suspends and restarts its <tt class=literal>updateThread</tt>, rather than
killing and recreating it. The new <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method
creates the thread and calls <tt class=literal>start()</tt> if
<tt class=literal>updateThread</tt> is <tt class=literal>null</tt>; otherwise
it assumes that the thread has been suspended, so it calls
<tt class=literal>resume()</tt>. The applet's
<tt class=literal>stop()</tt> method simply suspends the thread by calling
<tt class=literal>suspend()</tt>.

<p class=para>
What's new here is the <tt class=literal>destroy()</tt> method. This
is another method that <tt class=literal>UpdateApplet</tt> inherits from
the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class. The method is called by the Java
environment when the applet is going to be removed (often from a
cache). It provides a place where we can free up any resources
the applet is holding. This is the perfect place to cut the suspense
and clean up after our thread. In our <tt class=literal>destroy()</tt>
method, we check to see that the thread exists, and if it does, we
call <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> to kill it and set its reference to
<tt class=literal>null</tt>.
