<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-4">1.4 Safety of Design</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.SEC1"></A><a name="CH01.SEC2"></A>You have no doubt heard a lot about the fact that Java is designed to
be a safe language. But what do we mean by safe? Safe from what or
whom? The security features that attract the most attention for Java
are those features that make possible new types of dynamically
portable software. Java provides several layers of protection from
dangerously flawed code, as well as more mischievous things like
viruses and trojan horses. In the next section, we'll take a
look at how the Java virtual machine architecture assesses the safety
of code before it's run, and how the Java class loader builds a wall
around untrusted classes. These features provide the foundation for
high-level security policies that allow or disallow various kinds
of activities on an application-by-application basis.

<p class=para>
In this section though, we'll look at some general
features of the Java programming language. What is perhaps more
important, although often overlooked in the security din, is the
safety that Java provides by addressing common design and programming
problems. Java is intended to be as safe as possible from the simple
mistakes we make ourselves, as well as those we inherit from
contractors and third-party software vendors.  The goal with Java has
been to keep the language simple, provide tools that have demonstrated
their usefulness, and let users build more complicated facilities on
top of the language when needed.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-4.1">Syntactic Sweet 'n Low</A></h3>

<p class=para>
 
Java is parsimonious in its features; simplicity rules. Compared to C,
Java uses few automatic type coercions, and the ones that remain are
simple and well-defined. Unlike C++, Java doesn't allow
programmer-defined operator overloading. The string concatenation
operator <tt class=literal>+</tt> is the only system-defined, overloaded
operator in Java. All methods in Java are like C++ virtual methods, so
overridden methods are dynamically selected at run-time.

<p class=para>
Java doesn't have a preprocessor, so it doesn't have
macros, <tt class=literal>#define</tt> statements, or conditional source
compilation. These constructs exist in other languages primarily to
support platform dependencies, so in that sense they should not be needed 
in Java. Another
common use for conditional compilation is for debugging
purposes. 
Debugging code can be included directly in your Java source
code by making it conditional on a constant (i.e.,
<tt class=literal>static</tt> and
<tt class=literal>final</tt>) variable. The 
Java compiler is smart enough to remove this code when it determines
that it won't be called. 
<p class=para>
Java provides a well-defined package
structure for organizing class files. The package system allows the
compiler to handle most of the functionality of
<i class=emphasis>make</I>. The compiler also works with compiled
Java classes because all type information is preserved; there is no
need for header files. All of this means that Java code requires
little context to read. Indeed, you may sometimes find it faster to
look at the Java source code than to refer to class documentation.

<p class=para>
Java replaces some features that have been troublesome in other
languages.  For example, Java supports only a single inheritance class
hierarchy, but allows multiple inheritance of interfaces. An
interface, like an abstract class in C++, specifies
the behavior of an object without defining its implementation,
a powerful mechanism borrowed from Objective C. It allows a class
to implement the behavior of the interface, without needing to be a
subclass of the interface. Interfaces in Java eliminate the
need for multiple inheritance of classes, without causing the problems
associated with multiple inheritance.

<p class=para>
As you'll see in <a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, <i>The Java Language</i></A>, Java is a
simple, yet elegant, programming language.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-4.2">Type Safety and Method Binding</A></h3>

<p class=para>
One attribute of a language is the kind of type checking it uses. When
we categorize a language as static or dynamic we are referring to the
amount of information about variable types that is known at compile
time versus what is determined while the application is running.

<p class=para>
In a strictly statically typed language like C or C++, data
types are etched in stone when the source code is compiled. The
compiler benefits from having enough information to enforce usage
rules, so that it can catch many kinds of errors before the code is
executed. The code doesn't require run-time type checking, which is
advantageous because it can be compiled to be small and fast. But
statically typed languages are inflexible. They don't support
high-level constructs like lists and collections as naturally as
languages with dynamic type checking, and they make it impossible for
an application to safely import new data types while it's running.

<p class=para>
In contrast, a dynamic language like Smalltalk or Lisp has a
run-time system that manages the types of objects and performs
necessary type checking while an application is executing. These kinds
of languages allow for more complex behavior, and are in many respects
more powerful. However, they are also generally slower, less safe, and
harder to debug.

<p class=para>
The differences in languages have been likened to the
differences between kinds of automobiles.[2]
 Statically typed languages like C++ are analogous to a sports
car--reasonably safe and fast--but useful only if
you're driving on a nicely paved road. Highly dynamic languages
like Smalltalk are more like an offroad vehicle: they afford you
more freedom, but can be somewhat unwieldy. It can be fun (and
sometimes faster) to go roaring through the back woods, but you might
also get stuck in a ditch or mauled by bears.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
The credit for the car analogy goes to Marshall P. Cline, author of
the C++ FAQ.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Another attribute of a language deals with when it binds method
calls to their definitions. In an early-binding language like C or
C++, the definitions of methods are normally bound at compile-time,
unless the programmer specifies otherwise. Smalltalk, on the other
hand, is a late-binding language because it locates the definitions of
methods dynamically at run-time. Early-binding is important for
performance reasons; an application can run without the overhead
incurred by searching method tables at run-time. But late-binding is
more flexible. It's also necessary in an object-oriented language,
where a subclass can override methods in its superclass, and only the
run-time system can determine which method to run.

<p class=para>
Java provides some of the benefits of both C++ and Smalltalk;
it's a statically typed, late-binding language. Every object in Java
has a well-defined type that is known at compile time. This means
the Java compiler can do the same kind of static type checking and
usage analysis as C++. As a result, you can't assign an object
to the wrong type of reference or call nonexistent methods within
it. The Java compiler goes even further and prevents you from messing
up and trying to use uninitialized variables.

<p class=para>
However, Java is fully run-time typed as well. The Java
run-time system keeps track of all objects and makes it possible to
determine their types and relationships during execution. This means
you can inspect an object at run-time to determine what it is. Unlike
C or C++, casts from one type of object to another are checked by the
run-time system, and it's even possible to use completely new kinds
of dynamically loaded objects with a level of type safety.

<p class=para>
Since Java is a late-binding language, all methods are like
virtual methods in C++. This makes it possible for
a subclass to override methods in its superclass. But Java also allows
you to gain the performance benefits of early-binding by declaring
(with the <tt class=literal>final</tt> modifier) that certain methods
can't be overridden by subclassing, removing the need for run-time
lookup.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-4.3">Incremental Development</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java carries all data-type and method-signature information with it
from its source code to its compiled byte-code form. This means that
Java classes can be developed incrementally. Your own Java classes can
also be used safely with classes from other sources your compiler
has never seen.  In other words, you can write new code that
references binary class files, without losing the type safety you
gain from having the source code.  The Java run-time system can load
new classes while an application is running, thus providing the
capabilities of a dynamic linker.

<p class=para>
A common irritation with C++ is the "fragile base
class" problem.  In C++, the implementation of a base class can
be effectively frozen by the fact that it has many derived classes;
changing the base class may require recompilation of the derived
classes. This is an especially difficult problem for developers of
class libraries. Java avoids this problem by dynamically locating
fields within classes. As long as a class maintains a valid form of
its original structure, it can evolve without breaking other classes
that are derived from it or that make use of it.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-4.4">Dynamic Memory Management</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Some of the most important differences between Java and C or C++
involve how Java manages memory. Java eliminates ad hoc pointers and
adds garbage collection and true arrays to the language. These
features eliminate many otherwise insurmountable problems with safety,
portability, and optimization.

<p class=para>
Garbage collection alone should save countless programmers from the
single largest source of programming errors in C or C++: explicit
memory allocation and deallocation. In addition to maintaining objects
in memory, the Java run-time system keeps track of all references to
those objects.  When an object is no longer in use, Java automatically
removes it from memory. You can simply throw away references to
objects you no longer use and have confidence that the
system will clean them up at an appropriate time. Sun's current
implementation of Java uses a conservative, mark and sweep garbage
collector that runs intermittently in the background, which means that
most garbage collecting takes place between mouse clicks and keyboard
hits. Once you get used to garbage collection, you won't go
back. Being able to write air-tight C code that juggles memory without
dropping any on the floor is an important skill, but once you become
addicted to Java you can "realloc" some of those brain
cells to new tasks.

<p class=para>
You may hear people say that Java doesn't have
pointers. Strictly speaking, this statement is true, but it's also
misleading. What Java provides are
<i class=emphasis>references</I>--a safe kind of pointer--and
Java is rife with them. A reference is a strongly typed
handle for an object. All objects in Java, with the exception of
primitive numeric types, are accessed through references. If
necessary, you can use references to build all the normal kinds of
data structures you're accustomed to building with pointers,
like linked lists, trees, and so forth.  The only difference is that
with references you have to do so in a type-safe way.

<p class=para>
Another important difference between a reference and a pointer
is that you can't do pointer arithmetic with references. A
reference is an atomic thing; you can't manipulate the value of
a reference except by assigning it to an object. References are passed
by value, and you can't reference an object through more than a
single level of indirection. The protection of references is one of
the most fundamental aspects of Java security. It means that Java code
has to play by the rules; it can't peek into places it
shouldn't.

<p class=para>
Unlike C or C++ pointers, Java references can  point only to
class types.  There are no pointers to methods. 
People often complain
about this missing feature, but you will find that most tasks that
call for pointers to methods, such as callbacks, can be accomplished
using interfaces and anonymous adapter classes instead.
[3]
<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[3] 
Java 1.1 does have a <tt class=literal>Method</tt>
class, which lets you have a reference to a method. You can use a
<tt class=literal>Method</tt> object to construct a callback, but
it's tricky. 
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Finally, arrays in Java are true, first-class objects. They can
be dynamically allocated and assigned like other objects. Arrays know
their own size and type, and although you can't directly define array
classes or subclass them, they do have a well-defined inheritance
relationship based on the relationship of their base types. Having
true arrays in the language alleviates much of the need for pointer
arithmetic like that in C or C++.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-4.5">Error Handling</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java's roots are in networked devices and embedded systems. For
these applications, it's important to have robust and intelligent
error management.  Java has a powerful exception-handling mechanism,
somewhat like that in newer implementations of C++. Exceptions provide
a more natural and elegant way to handle errors. Exceptions allow you
to separate error-handling code from normal code, which makes for
cleaner, more readable applications.

<p class=para>
When an exception occurs, it causes the flow of program
execution to be transferred to a predesignated catcher block of
code. The exception carries with it an object that contains
information about the situation that caused the exception. The Java
compiler requires that a method either declare the exceptions it
can generate or catch and deal with them itself.  This promotes error
information to the same level of importance as argument and return
typing. As a Java programmer, you know precisely what exceptional
conditions you must deal with, and you have help from the compiler in
writing correct software that doesn't leave them unhandled.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-4.6">Multithreading</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Applications today require a high degree of parallelism. Even a very
single-minded application can have a complex user interface. As
machines get faster, users become more sensitive to waiting for
unrelated tasks that seize control of their time. Threads provide
efficient multiprocessing and distribution of tasks. Java makes
threads easy to use because support for them is built into the
language.

<p class=para>
Concurrency is nice, but there's more to programming with
threads than just performing multiple tasks simultaneously. In many
cases, threads need to be synchronized, which can be tricky without
explicit language support. Java supports synchronization based on the
monitor and condition model developed by C.A.R. Hoare--a sort of
lock and key system for accessing resources. A keyword,
<tt class=literal>synchronized</tt>, designates methods for safe,
serialized access within an object. Only one synchronized method
within the object may run at a given time. There are also simple,
primitive methods for explicit waiting and signaling between threads
interested in the same object.

<p class=para>
Learning to program with threads is an important part of
learning to program in Java. See <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, <i>Threads</i></A> for a 
discussion of this topic. For complete coverage of threads, see
<i class=citetitle>Java Threads</i>, by Scott Oaks and Henry Wong (O'Reilly &amp;
Associates).

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-4.7">Scalability</A></h3>

<p class=para>
At the lowest level, Java programs consist of classes. Classes are
intended to be small, modular components. They can be separated
physically on different systems, retrieved dynamically, and even
cached in various distribution schemes. Over classes, Java provides
packages, a layer of structure that groups classes into functional
units. Packages provide a naming convention for organizing classes and
a second level of organizational control over the visibility of
variables and methods in Java applications.

<p class=para>
Within a package, a class is either publicly visible or
protected from outside access. Packages form another type of scope
that is closer to the application level. This lends itself to building
reusable components that work together in a system. Packages also
help in designing a scalable application that can grow without
becoming a bird's nest of tightly coupled code dependency.
