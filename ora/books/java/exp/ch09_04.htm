<p class=para>
<a name="CH09.WEB1"></A><a name="CH09.WEB2"></A><a name="CH09.WEB3"></A>The content- and protocol-handler mechanisms I've introduced can
be used by any application that accesses data via
URLs. This mechanism is extremely flexible; to
handle a URL, you need only the appropriate
protocol and content handlers. To extend a Java-built Web browser so
that it can handle new and specialized kinds of
URLs, you need only supply additional content
and protocol handlers. Furthermore, Java's ability to load new
classes over the Net means that the handlers don't even need to
be a part of the browser. Content and protocol handlers could be
downloaded over the Net, from the same site that supplies the data,
and used by the browser. If you wanted to supply some completely new
data type, using a completely new protocol, you could make your data
file plus a content handler and a protocol handler available on your
Web server; anyone using a Web browser built in Java would
automatically get the appropriate handlers whenever they access your
data. In short, Java lets you build automatically extendible Web
browsers; instead of being a gigantic do-everything application, the
browser becomes a lightweight scaffold that dynamically incorporates
extensions as needed. <a href="#EXJ-CH-9-FIG-3">Figure 9.3</A> shows the
conceptual operation of a content handler; <a href="#EXJ-CH-9-FIG-4">Figure 9.4</A> does the same for a protocol handler.

<p class=para>
Sun's HotJava was the first browser to demonstrate these
features. When HotJava encounters a type of content or a protocol it
doesn't understand, it searches the remote server for an appropriate
handler class. HotJava also interprets HTML data as
a type of content; that is, HTML isn't a
privileged data type built into the browser. HTML
documents use the same content- and protocol-handler mechanisms as other
data types.

<p class=para>
Unfortunately, a few nasty flies are stuck in this
ointment. Content and protocol handlers are part of the Java
API: they're an intrinsic part of the mechanism
for working with URLs. However, specific content
and protocol handlers aren't part of the API;
the <tt class=literal>ContentHandler</tt> class and the two classes that
make up protocol handlers, <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> and
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>, are all abstract
classes. They define what an implementation must provide, but they
don't actually provide an implementation. This is not as
paradoxical as it sounds. After all, the API
defines the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class, but doesn't include any
specific applets. Likewise, the standard Java classes don't
include content handlers for HTML,
GIF, MPEG, or other common data
types. Even this isn't a real problem, although a library of
standard content handlers would be useful. (JDK provides some content and protocol handlers in the
<tt class=literal>sun.net.www.content</tt> and
<tt class=literal>sun.net.www.protocol</tt> packages, but these are
undocumented and subject to change.) There are two real issues here:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>There isn't any standard that tells you what
kind of object the content handler should return. I danced around the
issue just above, but it's a real problem. It's common sense
that GIF data should be turned into an
<tt class=literal>Image</tt> object, but at the moment, that's an
application-level decision. If you're writing your own
application and your own content handlers, that isn't an issue:
you can make any decision you want. But if you're writing
content handlers that interface to arbitrary Web browsers, you need a
standard that defines what the browser expects. You can use the
<tt class=literal>sun.net</tt> classes to make a guess, but a real
standard hasn't been worked out yet. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>There isn't any standard that tells you where
to put content and protocol handlers so that an application (like a
Web browser) can find them. Again, you can make application-level
decisions about where to place your own handlers, but that
doesn't solve the real problem: we want our content and protocol
handlers to be usable by any browser. It's possible to make an
educated guess about what the standard will be, but it's still a
guess. 

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
The next release of Sun's HotJava Web browser should certainly
take full advantage of handlers,[4]
 but current versions of Netscape Navigator do not. When the next
release of HotJava appears, it may resolve these questions, at least
on a de facto basis. (It would certainly be in Sun's interest to
publish some kind of standard as soon as possible.) Although we
can't tell you what standards will eventually evolve, we can
discuss how to write handlers for standalone applications. When the
standards issues are resolved, revising these handlers to work with
HotJava and other Web browsers should be simple.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[4] 
Downloadable handlers will be part of HotJava 1.0, though they are not
supported by the "pre-beta 1" release. The current release
<i class=emphasis>does</I> support local content and protocol
handlers. HotJava 1.0 also promises additional classes to support
network applications.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
The most common Java-capable platform, Netscape Navigator,
doesn't use the content- and protocol-handler mechanisms to
render Net resources. It's a classic monolithic application: knowledge
about certain kinds of objects, like HTML and
GIF files, is built-in. It can be extended via a
plug-in mechanism, but plug-ins aren't portable (they're
written in C) and can't be downloaded dynamically over the
Net. Applets running in Netscape can use a limited version of the
<tt class=literal>URL</tt> mechanism, but the browser imposes many
restrictions. As I said earlier, you can construct
URLs relative to the applet's code base, and
use the <tt class=literal>openStream()</tt> method to get a raw input
stream from which to read data, but that's it. For the time
being, you can't use your own content or protocol handlers to
work with applets loaded over the Net. Allowing this would be a simple
extension, even without content- and protocol-handler support
integrated into Netscape itself. We can only hope they add this
support soon.
