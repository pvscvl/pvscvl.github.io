<a name="CH11.I1"></A>If you've read the last few chapters and seen the examples in the
tutorial in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>A First Applet</i></A>, then you've probably picked up
the basics of how graphical operations are performed in Java. Up to
this point, we have done some simple drawing and even displayed an
image or two. In this chapter, we will finally give graphics
programming its due and go into depth about drawing techniques and the
tools for working with images in Java. In the next chapter, we'll
explore image processing tools in more detail and we'll look at the
classes that let you generate images pixel by pixel on the fly.

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-13-SECT-1">13.1 Basic Drawing</A></h2>

<p class=para>
The classes you'll use for drawing come from the
<tt class=literal>java.awt</tt> package, as shown in
<a href="#EXJ-CH-13-FIG-1">Figure 13.1</A>.[1]. 

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
The current set of drawing tools has many limitations. In
the near future, JavaSoft will be releasing packages for advanced 2D
graphics, which will have much greater capabilities. A 3D package is
also planned.  See <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, <i>Yet Another Language?</i></A> 
for information about likely future Java enhancements.

<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-13-FIG-1">Figure 13.1: Graphics classes of the java.awt package</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je1301.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 13-1]" width=502 height=432 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
An instance of the <tt class=literal>java.awt.Graphics</tt> class is
called a <i class=emphasis>graphics context</I>. It represents a
drawable surface such as a component's display area or an off-screen
image buffer. A graphics context provides methods for performing all
basic drawing operations on its area, including the painting of image
data. We call the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object a graphics
context because it also holds contextual information about the drawing
area. This information includes parameters like the drawing area's
clipping region, painting color, transfer mode, and text font. If you
consider the drawing area to be a painter's canvas, you might think of
a graphics context as an easel that holds a set of tools and marks off
the work area.

<p class=para>
There are four ways you normally acquire a 
<tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> 
object. Roughly, from most common to least, they are: 

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>From AWT, as the result of a painting request. In
this case, AWT acquires a new graphics context for
the appropriate area and passes it to your component's
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> or <tt class=literal>update()</tt> method.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Directly from an off-screen image buffer. In this case, we ask the
image buffer for a graphics context directly. We'll use this
when we discuss techniques like double buffering.

<p>
<li class=listitem>By copying an existing <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object. Duplicating
a graphics object can be useful for more elaborate drawing operations;
different copies of a <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object draw into the
same area on the screen, but can have different attributes and
clipping regions.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Directly from an on-screen component. It's possible to ask a
component to give you a <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object for its
display area. However, this is almost always a mistake; if you feel
tempted to do this, think about why you're trying to circumvent
the normal <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>/<tt class=literal>repaint()</tt>
mechanism.

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
Each time a component's <tt class=literal>update()</tt> or
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method is called, AWT
provides the component with a new <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object
for drawing in the display area. This means that attributes we set
during one painting session, such as drawing color or clipping region,
are reset the next time <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> or
<tt class=literal>update()</tt> is called. (Each call to
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> starts with a tidy new easel.) For the most
common attributes, like foreground color, background color, and font,
we can set defaults in the component itself. Thereafter, the graphics
contexts for painting in that component come with those properties
initialized appropriately.

<p class=para>
If we are working in a component's
<tt class=literal>update()</tt> method, we can assume our on-screen
artwork is still intact, and we need only to make whatever changes are
needed to bring the display up to date. One way to optimize drawing
operations in this case is by setting a clipping region, as
we'll see shortly. If our <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method is
called, however, we have to assume the worst and redraw the entire
display.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-13-SECT-1.1">Drawing Methods</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Methods of the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class operate in a standard
coordinate system. The origin of a newly created graphics context is
the top left pixel of the component's drawing area, as shown in 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-13-FIG-2">Figure 13.2</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-13-FIG-2">Figure 13.2: Graphics coordinate system</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je1302.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 13-2]" width=503 height=182 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
The diagram above illustrates the default coordinate system. The point
(0,0) is at the top left corner of the drawing area; the point (width,
height) is just outside the drawing area at the bottom right corner.
The point at the bottom right corner within the drawing area has
coordinates (width-1, height-1). This gives you a drawing area that is
<tt class=literal>width</tt> pixels wide and
<tt class=literal>height</tt> pixels high.

<p class=para>
<p class=para>
The coordinate system 
can be translated (shifted) with the <tt class=literal>translate()</tt> 
method to specify a new point as the origin. 
The drawable area of the graphics context can be limited to a
region with the <tt class=literal>setClip()</tt> method. 

<p class=para>
The basic drawing and painting methods should seem familiar to
you if you've done any graphics programming. The following
applet, <tt class=literal>TestPattern</tt>, exercises most of the simple
shape drawing commands; it's shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-13-FIG-3">Figure 13.3</A>.

<div class=figure>

public class TestPattern extends java.applet.Applet { 
    int theta = 45;
    public void paint( Graphics g ) {
        int Width = size().width;

        int width = Width/2;

        int delta = 90;

        } );

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>TestPattern</tt> draws a number of simple shapes and
responds to mouse clicks by rotating the filled arc and
repainting. Compile it and give it a try. If you click repeatedly on
the applet, you may notice that everything flashes when it
repaints. <tt class=literal>TestPattern</tt> is not very intelligent about
redrawing; we'll examine some better techniques in the upcoming
section on drawing techniques.

<p class=para>
With the exception of <tt class=literal>fillArc()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>fillPolygon()</tt>, each method takes a simple
<tt class=literal>x</tt>, <tt class=literal>y</tt> coordinate for the top left
corner of the shape and a <tt class=literal>width</tt> and
<tt class=literal>height</tt> for its size. We have picked values that
draw the shapes centered, at half the width and height of the applet.

<p class=para>
The most interesting shape we've have drawn is the
<tt class=literal>Polygon</tt>, a yellow diamond. A
<tt class=literal>Polygon</tt> object is specified by two arrays that
contain the <tt class=literal>x</tt> and <tt class=literal>y</tt> coordinates
of each vertex. In our example, the coordinates of the points in the
polygon are (<tt class=literal>polyx[0]</tt>,
<tt class=literal>polyy[0]</tt>), (<tt class=literal>polyx[1]</tt>,
<tt class=literal>polyy[1]</tt>), and so on. There are simple drawing
methods in the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class that take two arrays
and draw or fill the polygon, but we chose to create a
<tt class=literal>Polygon</tt> object and draw it instead. The reason is
that the <tt class=literal>Polygon</tt> object has some useful utility
methods that we might want to use later. A <tt class=literal>Polygon</tt>
can, for instance, give you its bounding box and tell you if a given
point lies within its area.

<p class=para>
AWT also provides a <tt class=literal>Shape</tt> interface, which
is implemented by different kinds of two dimensional objects.
Currently, it is only 
implemented by the <tt class=literal>Rectangle</tt> and
<tt class=literal>Polygon</tt> classes, but it may be a sign of
things to come, particularly when JavaSoft releases the extended 2D
drawing package. The <tt class=literal>setClip()</tt> method of
the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class takes a
<tt class=literal>Shape</tt> as an argument, but for the time
being, it only works if that <tt class=literal>Shape</tt> is a
<tt class=literal>Rectangle</tt>. 

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>fillArc()</tt> method requires six integer
arguments. The first four specify the bounding box for an
oval--just like the <tt class=literal>fillOval()</tt> method. The
final two arguments specify what portion of the oval we want to draw,
as a starting angle and an offset. Both the starting angle and the
offset are specified in degrees. Zero degrees is at three
o'clock; a positive angle is clockwise. For example, to draw the
right half of a circle, you might call:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
g.fillArc(0, 0, radius * 2, radius * 2, -90, 180);  
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
See the Dial example in <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, <i>Using and Creating GUI Components</i></A> (widgets?) for an example of some
trigonometric gymnastics with arcs().

<p class=para>
<a href="#EXJ-CH-13-TAB-1">Table 13.1</A> shows the shape-drawing methods of
the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class. As you can see, for each of
the <tt class=literal>fill()</tt> methods in the example,
there is a corresponding <tt class=literal>draw()</tt> method that renders
the shape as an unfilled line drawing.

<tt class=literal>draw3Drect()</tt> automatically chooses colors by
"darkening" the current color.  So you should set the color to
something other than black, which is the default (maybe gray or
white); if you don't, you'll just get black on both sides.  For an
example, see the <tt class=literal>PictureButton</tt> in <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, <i>Using and Creating GUI Components</i></A>.

<p class=para>
There are a few important drawing methods missing from 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-13-TAB-1">Table 13.1</A>. For example, the
<tt class=literal>drawString()</tt> method, which draws text, and the
<tt class=literal>drawImage()</tt> method, which draws an image. We'll
discuss these methods in detail in later sections.
