<a name="CH10.LAY3"></A><a name="CH10.LAY4"></A>A layout manager arranges the child components of a container, as
shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-12-FIG-1">Figure 12.1</A>. It positions and sets the
size of components within the container's display area according to a
particular layout scheme.  The layout manager's job is to fit the
components into the available area, while maintaining the proper
spatial relationships between the components. AWT
comes with a few standard layout managers that will collectively
handle most situations; you can make your own layout managers if you
have special requirements.

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Every container has a default layout manager; therefore, when
you make a new container, it comes with a
<tt class=literal>LayoutManager</tt> object of the appropriate type. You
can install a new layout manager at any time with the
<tt class=literal>setLayout()</tt> method. Below, we set the layout
manager of a container to a <tt class=literal>BorderLayout</tt>:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
setLayout ( new BorderLayout() ); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Notice that we call the <tt class=literal>BorderLayout</tt> constructor,
but we don't even save a reference to the layout manager. This
is typical; once you have installed a layout manager, it does its work
behind the scenes, interacting with the container. You rarely call the
layout manager's methods directly, so you don't usually need a
reference (a notable exception for <tt class=literal>CardLayout</tt>).
However, you do need to know what the layout manager is going to do with 
your components as you work with them.

<p class=para>
As I explained earlier, the <tt class=literal>LayoutManager</tt> is
consulted whenever a container's <tt class=literal>doLayout()</tt> method is called (usually when
it is validated), to reorganize the contents. It does its job by calling the 
<tt class=literal>setLocation()</tt> and 
<tt class=literal>setBounds()</tt> methods of the individual child
components to arrange them in the container's display area. 
A container is layed out the first time it is displayed, and
thereafter whenever 
the container's <tt class=literal>validate()</tt> method is called.
Containers that are a subclass of the <tt class=literal>Window</tt> class
(which include <tt class=literal>Frame</tt>) are automatically
validated whenever they are packed or resized. Calling
<tt class=literal>pack()</tt> sets the window's size so it is as
small as possible while holding all its components at their preferred
sizes.

<p class=para>
Every component determines three important pieces of information used by
the layout manager in placing and sizing it: 
a minimum size, a maximum size, and a preferred size. 
These are reported by the
<tt class=literal>getMinimumSize()</tt>,
<tt class=literal>getMaximumSize()</tt>, and
<tt class=literal>getPreferredSize()</tt>, methods of 
<tt class=literal>Component</tt>, respectively. For example, a plain
<tt class=literal>Button</tt> object can normally be sized to any
proportions. However, the button's designer can provide a preferred size 
for a good-looking button. The layout manager might use
this size when there are no other constraints, or it might ignore it,
depending on its scheme. Now, if we give the button a label, the
button may need a minimum size in order to display itself
properly. The layout manager might show more respect for the
button's minimum size and guarantee that it has at least that
much space.  Similarly, a particular component might not be able to display
itself properly if it is too large (perhaps it has to scale up an image);
it can use <tt class=literal>getMaximumSize()</tt> to report the
largest size it considers acceptable.[1]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
Unfortunately, the current set of layout managers doesn't do
anything with the maximum size. This may change in a future release. 
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
The preferred size of a <tt class=literal>Container</tt> object has
the same meaning as for any other type of component. However, since a
<tt class=literal>Container</tt> may hold its own components and want to
arrange them in its own layout, its preferred size is a function of
its layout manager. The layout manager is therefore involved in
both sides of the issue. It asks the components in its container for
their preferred (or minimum) sizes in order to arrange them. Based on
those values it also calculates the preferred size that is reported by
its own container to that container's parent.

<p class=para>
When a layout manager is called to arrange its components, 
it is working within a fixed area. It usually begins by looking at its
container's dimensions, and the preferred or minimum sizes of
the child components. It then doles out screen area and sets the sizes
of components according to its scheme. You can override the
<tt class=literal>getMinimumSize()</tt>,
<tt class=literal>getMaximumSize()</tt>, and 
<tt class=literal>getPreferredSize()</tt> methods of a component, but you
should do this only if you are actually specializing the component, and
it has new needs. If you find yourself fighting with a layout manager
because it's changing the size of one of your components, you are
probably using the wrong kind of layout manager or not composing your
user interface properly. Remember that it's possible to use a number of
<tt class=literal>Panel</tt> objects in a given display, where each one
has its own <tt class=literal>LayoutManager</tt>. Try breaking down the
problem: place related components in their own
<tt class=literal>Panel</tt> and then arrange the panels in the
container.  When that becomes too complicated, you can choose to use a constraint
based layout manager like <tt class=literal>GridBagLayout</tt>,
which we'll discuss later in this chapter. 

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-12-SECT-1">12.1 FlowLayout</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH10.FL"></A><a name="CH10.FL2"></A><tt class=literal>FlowLayout</tt> is a simple layout manager that tries to
arrange components with their preferred sizes, from left to right and
top to bottom in the display. A <tt class=literal>FlowLayout</tt> can have
a specified justification of <tt class=literal>LEFT</tt>,
<tt class=literal>CENTER</tt>, or <tt class=literal>RIGHT</tt>, and a fixed
horizontal and vertical padding. By default, a flow layout uses
<tt class=literal>CENTER</tt> justification, meaning that all components
are centered within the area allotted to
them. <tt class=literal>FlowLayout</tt> is the default for
<tt class=literal>Panel</tt> components like <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>.

<p class=para>
The following applet adds five buttons to the default
<tt class=literal>FlowLayout</tt>; the result is shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-12-FIG-2">Figure 12.2</A>.

</DIV>

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*; 
 
public class Flow extends java.applet.Applet {  
    public void init() { 
        // Default for Applet is FlowLayout 
        add( new Button("One") ); 
        add( new Button("Two") ); 
        add( new Button("Three") ); 
        add( new Button("Four") ); 
        add( new Button("Five") ); 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If the applet is small enough, some of the buttons spill over to a
second or third row.
