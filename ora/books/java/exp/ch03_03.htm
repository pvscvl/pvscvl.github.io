<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-3-SECT-3">3.3 The Java Compiler</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH03.JAVAC"></A>In this section, I'm going to say a few words about
<i class=command>javac</i>, the Java compiler that is supplied as part
of Sun's JDK. (If you are happily working in
another development environment, you may want to skip ahead to the
next section.) The <i class=command>javac</i> compiler is written
entirely in Java, so it's available for any platform that supports the
Java run-time system. The ability to support its own development
environments is an important stage in a language's development.
Java makes this bootstrapping automatic by supplying a ready-to-run
compiler at the same cost as porting the interpreter.

<p class=para>
<i class=command>javac</i> turns Java source code into a
compiled class that contains Java virtual machine byte-code. By
convention, source files are named with a <i class=filename>.java</i>
extension; the resulting class files have a
<i class=filename>.class</i> extension. <i class=command>javac</i>
considers a file to be a single compilation unit. As you'll see
in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, <i>Objects in Java</i></A>, classes in a given compilation unit
share certain features like <tt class=literal>package</tt> and
<tt class=literal>import</tt> statements.

<p class=para>
<i class=command>javac</i> allows you one <tt class=literal>public</tt>
class per file and insists the file have the same name as the
class. If the filename and class name don't match,
<i class=command>javac</i> issues a compilation error. A single file
can contain multiple classes, as long as only one of the classes is
<tt class=literal>public</tt>. You should avoid packing lots of classes
into a single file. The compiler lets you include extra
non-<tt class=literal>public</tt> classes in a <i class=filename>.java</i>
file, so that you can implement a class that is tightly coupled to
another class without a lot of hassle. But you should have more than
one class in a file if the <tt class=literal>public</tt> class in the file
is the only one that ever uses additional classes.

<p class=para>
Now for an example. The source code for the following class
should be placed in a file called <i class=filename>BigBird.java</i>:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
package animals.birds 
 
public class BigBird extends Bird { 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
We can then compile it with: 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
% javac BigBird.java 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Unlike the Java interpreter, which takes a class name as its argument,
<i class=command>javac</i> requires an actual filename to process.
The above command produces the class file
<i class=filename>BigBird.class</i> and stores it in the same directory
as the source file. While it's useful to have the class file in the
same directory as the source when you are working on a simple example,
for most real applications you'll need to store the class file
in an appropriate place in the class path.

<p class=para>
You can use the <tt class=literal>-d</tt> option to
<i class=command>javac</i> to specify an alternate directory for
storing the class files it generates. The specified directory is used
as the root of the class hierarchy, so <i class=filename>.class</i>
files are placed in this directory or in a subdirectory below it,
depending on the package name of the class. For example, we can use
the following command to put our <i class=filename>BigBird.class</i>
file in an appropriate location:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
% javac -d /home/vicky/Java/classes BigBird.java 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
When you use the <tt class=literal>-d</tt> option,
<i class=command>javac</i> automatically creates any directories
needed to store the class file in the appropriate place. In the above
command, the <i class=filename>BigBird.class</i> file is stored in
<i class=filename>/home/vicky/Java/classes/animals/birds</i>.

<p class=para>
You can specify multiple <i class=filename>.java</i> files in a
single <i class=command>javac</i> command; the compiler simply creates
a class file for each source file. But you don't need to list
source files for other classes your class references, as long as
the other classes have already been compiled. During compilation, Java
resolves other class references using the class path. If our class
references other classes in <tt class=literal>animals.birds</tt> or other
packages, the appropriate paths should be listed in the class
path at compile time, so that <i class=command>javac</i> can find the
appropriate class files. You either make sure that the
<tt class=literal>CLASSPATH</tt> environment variable is set or use the
<tt class=literal>-classpath</tt> option to <i class=command>javac</i>.

<p class=para>
The Java compiler is more intelligent than your average
compiler and replaces some of the functionality of a
<i class=command>make</i> utility. For example,
<i class=command>javac</i> compares the modification times of the
source and class files for all referenced classes and recompiles them
as necessary. A compiled Java class remembers the source file from
which it was compiled, so as long as the source file is in the same
directory as the class file, <i class=command>javac</i> can recompile
the source if necessary. If, in the above example, class
<tt class=literal>BigBird</tt> references another class,
<tt class=literal>animals.furry.Grover</tt>, <i class=command>javac</i>
looks for the source <i class=filename>Grover.java</i> in an
<tt class=literal>animals.furry</tt> package and recompiles it if
necessary to bring the <i class=filename>Grover.class</i> class file up
to date.

<p class=para>
It's important to note that <i class=command>javac</i> can do
its job even if only the compiled versions of referenced
classes are available. Java class files contain all the data type
and method signature information source files do, so
compiling against binary class files is as type safe (and exception
safe) as compiling with Java source code.
