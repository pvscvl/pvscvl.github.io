<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT1-AUTOID.1">1.9 A Java Road Map</A></h2>

<p class=para>
With everything that's going on, it's hard to keep track of what's
available now, what's promised, and what has been around for some
time. Here's a road map that tries to impose some order on Java's
past, present, and future. 

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.3">The Past: Java 1.0</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java 1.0 provided the basic framework for Java development: the
language itself, plus packages that let you write applets and simple
applications. Java 1.0 is officially obsolete, though it will be some
time before vendors catch up with the new release. 

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.4">The Present: Java 1.1</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java 1.1 is the current version of Java. It incorporates major
improvements in the AWT package (Java's windowing facility). It also
adds many completely new features, including: 

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry>JDBC<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A general facility for interacting with databases.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>RMI<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
Remote Method Invocation: a facility that lets you call methods
that are provided by a server running somewhere else on the network.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>JavaBeans<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
Java's component architecture, which we discussed earlier.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>Security<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A facility for cryptography; this is the basis for signed classes,
which we discussed earlier.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>Internationalization<br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The ability to write programs that adapt themselves to the
language the user wants to use; the program automatically displays
text in the appropriate language.</DL>
<p class=para>
Java 1.1 incorporates many other improvements and new features, but
these are the most important. As of May, 1997, most Web browsers
haven't yet incorporated Java 1.1, but they will as soon as possible.
In this book, we'll try to give you a taste of as many features as
possible; unfortunately for us, the Java environment has become so
rich that it's impossible to cover everything in a single book.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.5">The Future</A></h3>

<p class=para>
We've mentioned a few of the things that are in the pipeline,
including high quality audio, advanced 3D rendering, and speech
synthesis. Other things to look forward to are class libraries for
advanced 2D graphics (Java 2D), electronic commerce (JECF),
managing network devices (Java Management),
naming and directory services (JNDI),
telephony (JTAPI), and writing network servers (Java Server). Beta
versions of some of these facilities are available now. 

<p class=para>
We're also starting to see new kinds of computing devices that
incorporate Java. Network computers that are based on Java and use the
HotJava browser as their user interface are already available, as are
"smart cards": credit card-like devices with a Java processor built
in. You can expect to see Java incorporated into PDAs, telephones, and
many other devices.
