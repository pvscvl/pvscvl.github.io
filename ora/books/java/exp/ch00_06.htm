<p class=para>
Many people contributed to putting this book together under a
schedule that became increasingly rushed as time passed. Thanks to
their efforts, we gave birth to something we can all be proud of.

<p class=para>
Foremost we would like to thank Tim O'Reilly for giving
us the opportunity to write this book. Special thanks to Mike
Loukides, the series editor, whose endless patience and
experience got us through the difficult parts and to Paula Ferguson,
whose organizational and editing abilities got the material into
its final form. It's due largely to Mike and Paula's tireless
efforts that this book has gotten to you as quickly as it has. We
could not have asked for a more skillful or responsive team of people
with whom to work.

<p class=para>
Particular thanks are due to our technical reviewers: Andrew
Cohen, Eric Raymond, and Lisa Farley. All of them gave thorough
reviews that were invaluable in assembling the final draft. Eric
contributed many bits of text that eventually found their way into the
book.

<p class=para>
Speaking of borrowings, the original version of the glossary
came from David Flanagan's book, <i class=citetitle>Java in a
Nutshell</i>. We also borrowed the class hierarchy diagrams
from David's book. These diagrams were based on similar diagrams
by Charles L. Perkins. His original diagrams are available at
<a href="../../../../../../../rendezvous.com/java/">http://rendezvous.com/java/</A>.

<p class=para>
Thanks also to Marc Wallace and Steven Burkett for reading the
book in progress. As for the crowd in St. Louis: a special thanks to
LeeAnn Langdon of the Library Ltd. and Kerri Bonasch. Deepest
thanks to Victoria Doerr for her patience and love. Finally, thanks
for the support of the "lunch" crowd: Karl "Gooch"
Stefvater, Bryan "Butter" O'Connor, Brian "Brian"
Gottlieb, and the rest of the clan at Washington University.

<p class=para>
Many people in O'Reilly's production and design
groups contributed their blood, sweat, and tears to the project. Mary
Anne Weeks Mayo was production editor and copy editor, and had the
stress-filled job of working under a very tight deadline with chapters
arriving asynchronously (which means at random and later than
expected). Seth Maislin wrote the index, and Stephen Spainhour adapted
David Flanagan's glossary for this book. Chris Reilley converted
rough diagrams into professional technical illustrations. Erik Ray,
Ellen Siever, and Lenny Muellner converted HTML
files into SGML and made sure we could convert
electrons into paper without mishap. Lenny also implemented a new
design for this book, which was created by Nancy Priest. Hanna Dyer
created the back cover; Edie Freedman designed the front cover.
