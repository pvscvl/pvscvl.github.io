<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-11-SECT-4">11.2 Text Components</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH10.TEXT1"></A><a name="CH10.TEXT3"></A>
AWT gives us two basic
text components: <tt class=literal>TextArea</tt> is a multiline text
editor with vertical and horizontal
scrollbars; <tt class=literal>TextField</tt> is a simple, single-line text
editor. 
Both <tt class=literal>TextField</tt> and
<tt class=literal>TextArea</tt> derive from the
<tt class=literal>TextComponent</tt> 
class, which provides 
the functionality they have in common.  This includes methods for 
setting and retrieving the displayed text, specifying whether the text 
is "editable" or read-only, manipulating the caret (cursor) position in
the display, and manipulating the "selection text."

<p class=para>
Both <tt class=literal>TextArea</tt>s and  
<tt class=literal>TextField</tt>s send
<tt class=literal>TextEvent</tt>s to listeners when their text is 
modified. To receive these events, you must implement the
<tt class=literal>java.awt.TextListener</tt> interface and
register by calling the component's
<tt class=literal>addTextListener()</tt> method. 
In addition, <tt class=literal>TextField</tt> components generate
an <tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt> whenever the user presses
the RETURN key within the 
field. To get these events, implement the 
<tt class=literal>ActionListener</tt> interface and call
<tt class=literal>addActionListener()</tt> to register.

<p class=para>
Here are a couple of simple applets that show you how to work with
text areas and fields. 

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch11-SECT2-AUTOID.1">A TextEntryBox</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Our first example, <tt class=literal>TextEntryBox</tt>, creates a
<tt class=literal>TextArea</tt> and ties it to a
<tt class=literal>TextField</tt>, as you can see in 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-11-FIG-1">Figure 11.1</A>. 

<p class=para>
When the user hits RETURN in the
<tt class=literal>TextField</tt>, we receive an
<tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt> 
and add the line to the <tt class=literal>TextArea</tt>'s display. 

<p class=para>
Try it out. You may have
to click your mouse in the <tt class=literal>TextField</tt> to give it
focus before typing in it. If you fill up the display with lines, you
can test drive the scrollbar.

</DIV>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
public class TextEntryBox extends java.applet.Applet 
implements ActionListener { 
    TextArea area;
    TextField field;
    
    public void init() {
        setLayout( new BorderLayout() );
        add( "Center", area = new TextArea() );
        area.setFont( new Font("TimesRoman",Font.BOLD,18) );
        area.setText("Howdy!\n");
        add( "South", field = new TextField() );
        field.addActionListener ( this );
    }
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        area.append( field.getText() + '\n' );
        field.setText("");
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>TextEntryBox</tt> is exceedingly simple; we've done a
few things to make it more interesting. First, we set the
applet's layout manager to <tt class=literal>BorderLayout</tt>. We
use <tt class=literal>BorderLayout</tt> to position the
<tt class=literal>TextArea</tt> above the
<tt class=literal>TextField</tt>; the text area goes in the
"North" region of the layout, and the text field is in the "South" region. We
give the text area a bigger font using
<tt class=literal>Component</tt>'s <tt class=literal>setFont()</tt>
method; fonts are discussed in <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, <i>Using and Creating GUI Components</i></A>. Finally, we want to be
notified whenever the user types RETURN in the text field, so we
register our applet (<tt class=literal>this</tt>) as a listener
for action events by calling
<tt class=literal>field.addActionListener(this)</tt>. 

<p class=para>
 Hitting RETURN in the
<tt class=literal>TextField</tt> generates an action event, and
that's where the fun begins. We handle the event in the
<tt class=literal>actionPerformed()</tt> method of our container, the
<tt class=literal>TextEntryBox</tt> applet. 
Then we use the <tt class=literal>getText()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>setText()</tt> methods to manipulate the text the user
has typed. These methods can be used for both
<tt class=literal>TextField</tt> and
<tt class=literal>TextArea</tt>, because 
these components are derived from the <tt class=literal>TextComponent</tt>
class, and therefore have some common functionality.

<p class=para>

Our event handler is called
<tt class=literal>actionPerformed()</tt>, as required by the 
<tt class=literal>ActionListener</tt> interface. First,
<tt class=literal>actionPerformed()</tt> calls 
<tt class=literal>field.getText()</tt> to read the text that the
user typed into our 
<tt class=literal>TextField</tt>. It then adds this text to
the <tt class=literal>TextArea</tt> by calling
<tt class=literal>area.append()</tt>. Finally, we clear the text
field by calling <tt class=literal>field.setText("")</tt>,
preparing it for more input. 

<p class=para>
By default, <tt class=literal>TextField</tt> and
<tt class=literal>TextArea</tt> are editable; you can type and edit in
both text components. They can be changed to output-only areas with
the <tt class=literal>setEditable()</tt> method. Both text components also
support <i class=emphasis>selections</I>. A selection is a subset of
text that is highlighted for copying and pasting in your windowing
system. You select text by dragging the mouse over it; you can then
copy and paste it into other text windows. You can get the selected
text explicitly with <tt class=literal>getSelectedText()</tt>.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch11-SECT2-AUTOID.2">TextWatcher Applet</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Our next example is a <tt class=literal>TextWatcher</tt> that
consists of two linked text 
areas. Anything the user types into either area is reflected in both.
It demonstrates how to handle a <tt class=literal>TextEvent</tt>,
which is generated whenever 
the text changes in a <tt class=literal>TextComponent</tt>. It
also demonstrates how to use 
an adapter class, which is a more realistic way of setting up event
listeners. Registering the applet as a listener is okay for simple
programs, but the technique shown here will serve you better in more
complex situations.

        add( area2 = new TextArea() );

        TextArea targetArea;
        TextSyncAdapter( TextArea targetArea ) {
            this.targetArea = targetArea;
        }
        public void textValueChanged(TextEvent e) {
            TextArea sourceArea = (TextArea)e.getSource();
            if ( ! targetArea.getText().equals( sourceArea.getText() ) )
                targetArea.setText( sourceArea.getText() );
        }
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Setting up the display is simple. We use a
<tt class=literal>GridLayout</tt> and add two 
text areas to the layout. Then we add our listeners for text events,
which are generated whenever the text in a
<tt class=literal>TextComponent</tt> is changed. 
There is one listener for each text
area; both are <tt class=literal>TextSyncAdapter</tt> objects.
One listens to 
events from <tt class=literal>area1</tt> and modifies the text in
<tt class=literal>area2</tt>; the other listens 
to events from <tt class=literal>area2</tt> and modifies the text
in <tt class=literal>area1</tt>. 

<p class=para>
All the real work is done by the
<tt class=literal>TextSyncAdapter</tt>. This is an inner 
class; its definition is contained within
<tt class=literal>TextWatcher</tt> and can't be 
referenced by classes outside of our
<tt class=literal>TextWatcher</tt>. The adapter 
implements the <tt class=literal>TextListener</tt> interface, and
therefore includes a 
<tt class=literal>textValueChanged()</tt> method. 

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>textValueChanged()</tt> is the heart of the
listener. First, it extracts 
the source area from the incoming event; this is the area that
generated the event. The area whose text the listener is changing (the
target area) was stored by the constructor. Then it tests whether or
not the texts in both areas are the same. If they aren't, it calls the
target area's <tt class=literal>setText()</tt> method to set its
text equal to the source area's. 

<p class=para>
The one mysterious feature of this method is the test for equality.
Why is it necessary? Why can't we just say "the text in one area
changed, so set the text in the other?" A
<tt class=literal>TextEvent</tt> is generated 
whenever a <tt class=literal>TextComponent</tt> is modified for
any reason; this includes 
changes caused by software, not just changes that occur when a user
types. So think about what happens when the user types into
<tt class=literal>area1</tt>. 
Typing generates a <tt class=literal>TextEvent</tt>, which causes
the adapter to change the 
text in <tt class=literal>area2</tt>. This generates another
<tt class=literal>TextEvent</tt>, which if we didn't do 
any testing, would cause us to change area1 again, which would
generate another <tt class=literal>TextEvent</tt>, ad infinitum.
By checking whether or not 
the texts in our two areas are equivalent, we prevent an infinite loop
in which text events ping-pong back and forth between the two areas.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch11-SECT2-AUTOID.3">Managing Text Yourself</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Text areas and text fields do the work of handling keystrokes for you,
but they're certainly not your only options for dealing with keyboard
input. Any <tt class=literal>Component</tt> can register
<tt class=literal>KeyListener</tt>s to 
recieve <tt class=literal>KeyEvent</tt>s that occur when their
component has focus <a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, <i>Understand the Abstract Windowing Toolkit</i></A>.  We will provide an 
example here that shows how you might use these to make your own text
gadgets.

        g.drawString(text.toString() + "_", 20, 20);
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Fundamentally, all we are doing is collecting text in a
<tt class=literal>StringBuffer</tt> 
and using the <tt class=literal>drawString()</tt> method to
display it on the screen. As 
you'd expect, paint() is responsible for managing the display. 

<p class=para>
In this applet, we're interested in receiving
<tt class=literal>KeyEvent</tt>s, which occur 
whenever the user presses any key. To get these events, the applet
calls its own <tt class=literal>addKeyListener()</tt> method. The
<tt class=literal>KeyListener</tt> itself is an 
anonymous class. It doesn't have a name and can't be used anywhere
else. We create this class by getting a new
<tt class=literal>KeyAdapter()</tt>, and 
overriding its <tt class=literal>keyPressed()</tt> method.
(Remember that <tt class=literal>KeyAdapter</tt> contains 
do-nothing implementations of the methods in the
<tt class=literal>KeyListener</tt> 
interface.) All <tt class=literal>keyPressed()</tt> does is call
our private method type(), 
with two arguments: the key code of the key that was pressed, and the
logical character represented by the keystroke. 

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>type()</tt> shows you how to deal with
keystrokes. Each key event is 
identified with a code, which identifies the actual key typed, and a
character, which identifies what the user meant to type. This sounds
confusing, but it isn't. Basically, there is a constant for each key
on the keyboard: <tt class=literal>VK_ENTER</tt> for the ENTER
(return) key, <tt class=literal>VK_A</tt> for the 
letter A, and so on. However, the physical keystroke isn't usually the
same as what the user types: the character capital A is made up of two
keystrokes, while lower case a is made up of one.

<p class=para>
Therefore, you can expect events for both physical keystrokes and
typed characters. The <tt class=literal>int</tt> constant
<tt class=literal>VK_UNDEFINED</tt> is used for the physical key
code when the event doesn't correspond to a single keystroke. The
<tt class=literal>char</tt> constant
<tt class=literal>CHAR_UNDEFINED</tt> indicates that the event
corresponds to a physical keystroke, but not a typed character. 

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>type()</tt> method is called with both the
key constant and the 
character as arguments. The way we use them is relatively simple and
would need more work for an industrial strength program. Simply, if
the physical key is <tt class=literal>VK_BACK_SPACE</tt>, we
delete the last character from 
the <tt class=literal>StringBuffer</tt> we're building. If it's
<tt class=literal>VK_ENTER</tt>, we clear the 
<tt class=literal>StringBuffer</tt>. If the physical key has any
other value, we look at the 
character the user typed. If this is a printable character, we add it
to the <tt class=literal>StringBuffer</tt>. Anything else we
ignore. Once we've handled the 
event, we call <tt class=literal>repaint()</tt> to update the
screen. Using key codes to 
handle operations like  "Backspace" or "Enter" is easier and less
bug-prone than working with odd "Control" characters.

<p class=para>
A final note on our anonymous adapter class: in essence our adapter is
letting us write a "callback," by calling
<tt class=literal>type()</tt> whenever
<tt class=literal>keyPressed()</tt> 
is called. That's one important use for adapters: to map methods in
the various listener interfaces into the methods that make sense for
your class. Unlike C or C++, Java won't let us pass a method pointer
as an argument, 
but it will let us create an anonymous class that calls our method
and passes an instance of that class.
