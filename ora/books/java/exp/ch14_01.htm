<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.PROCESS"></A>Up to this point, we've confined ourselves to working with the
high-level drawing commands of the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class
and using images in a hands-off mode. In this section, we'll
clear up some of the mystery surrounding images and see how they are
produced and used. The classes in the
<tt class=literal>java.awt.image</tt> package handle image processing;
<a href="#EXJ-CH-14-FIG-1">Figure 14.1</A> shows the classes in this package.

<p class=para>
First, we'll return to our discussion about image
observers and see how we can get more control over image data as it's
processed asynchronously by AWT components. Then we'll 
open the hood and have a look at image production. If you're interested in 
creating sophisticated graphics, such as rendered images or video streams, 
this will teach you about the foundations of image construction in 
Java.[1]

Java Media will support plug-n-play streaming media.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Objects that work with image data fall into one of three
categories: image-data producers, image-data consumers, and
image-status observers. Image producers implement the
<tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt> interface. They create pixel data and
distribute it to one or more consumers. Image consumers implement a
corresponding <tt class=literal>ImageConsumer</tt> interface. They eat the
pixel data and do something useful with it, such as display it on
screen or analyze its contents. Image observers, as I mentioned
earlier, implement the <tt class=literal>ImageObserver</tt>
interface. They are effectively nosy neighbors of image consumers that
watch as the image data arrives.

<p class=para>
Image producers generate the information that defines each
pixel of an image. A pixel has both a color and a transparency; the
transparency specifies how pixels underneath the image show
through. Image producers maintain a list of registered consumers for
the image and send them this pixel data in one or more passes, as the
pixels are generated. Image producers give the consumers other kinds
of information as well, such as the image's dimensions. The
producer also notifies the consumer when it has reached a boundary of
the image. For a static image, such as GIF or
JPEG data, the producer signals when the entire
image is complete, and production is finished. For a video source or
animation, the image producer could generate a continuous stream of
pixel data and mark the end of each frame.

<p class=para>
An image producer delivers pixel data and other image-attribute
information by invoking methods in its consumers, as shown in 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-14-FIG-2">Figure 14.2</A>. This diagram illustrates an image producer
sending pixel data to three consumers by invoking their
<tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt> methods.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-FIG-2">Figure 14.2: Image observers, producers, and consumers</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je1402.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 14-2]" width=503 height=193 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Each consumer represents a view of the image. A given consumer
might prepare the image for display on a particular medium, or it
might simply serve as a filter and pass the image data to another
consumer down the line.

<p class=para>
<a href="#EXJ-CH-14-FIG-2">Figure 14.2</A> also shows an image observer,
watching the status of one of the consumers. The observer is
notified as new portions of the image and new attributes are
ready. Its job is to track this information and let another part of
the application know its status. As I discussed earlier, the image
observer is essentially a callback that is notified asynchronously as
the image is built. The default <tt class=literal>Component</tt> class
image observer that we used in our previous examples called
<tt class=literal>repaint()</tt> for us each time a new section of the
image was available, so that the screen was updated more or less
continuously as the data arrived. A different kind of image observer
might wait for the entire image before telling the application to
display it; yet another observer might update a loading meter showing
how far the image loading had progressed.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-SECT-5.1">Implementing an ImageObserver</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.OBS2"></A><a name="CH11.OBS3"></A>To be an image observer, you have to implement the single method,
<tt class=literal>imageUpdate()</tt>, defined by the
<tt class=literal>java.awt.image.ImageObserver</tt> interface:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public boolean imageUpdate(Image image, int flags, int x, int y, 
                           int width, int height)
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>imageUpdate()</tt> is called by the consumer, as needed,
to pass the observer information about the construction of its view of
the image. Essentially, any time the image changes, the consumer tells
the observer so that the observer can perform any necessary actions,
like repainting. <tt class=literal>image</tt> holds a reference to the
<tt class=literal>Image</tt> object the consumer is
processing. <tt class=literal>flags</tt> is an integer whose bits specify
what information about the image is now available. The values of the
flags are defined as <tt class=literal>static</tt> identifiers in the
<tt class=literal>ImageObserver</tt> interface, as shown in 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-14-TAB-1">Table 14.1</A>.

<p class=para>
The flags determine which of the other parameters,
<tt class=literal>x</tt>, <tt class=literal>y</tt>, <tt class=literal>width</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>height</tt>, hold valid data and what they mean. To
test whether a particular flag in the <tt class=literal>flags</tt> integer
is set, we have to resort to some binary shenanigans. The following
class, <tt class=literal>MyObserver</tt>, implements the
<tt class=literal>ImageObserver</tt> interface and prints its information
as it's called:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*; 
import java.awt.image.*; 
 
class MyObserver implements ImageObserver { 
 
    public boolean imageUpdate( Image image, int flags, int x, int y, 
                                int width, int height) { 
 
        if ( (flags &amp; HEIGHT) !=0 ) 
            System.out.println("Image height = " + height ); 
 
        if ( (flags &amp; WIDTH ) !=0 ) 
            System.out.println("Image width = " + width ); 
         
        if ( (flags &amp; FRAMEBITS) != 0 ) 
            System.out.println("Another frame finished."); 
 
        if ( (flags &amp; SOMEBITS) != 0 ) 
            System.out.println("Image section :" 
                         + new Rectangle( x, y, width, height ) ); 
 
        if ( (flags &amp; ALLBITS) != 0 ) { 
            System.out.println("Image finished!"); 
            return false;  
        } 
 
        if ( (flags &amp; ABORT) != 0 )  { 
            System.out.println("Image load aborted..."); 
            return false;  
        } 
 
        return true;  
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>imageUpdate()</tt> method of
<tt class=literal>MyObserver</tt> is called by the consumer periodically,
and prints simple status messages about the construction of the
image. Notice that <tt class=literal>width</tt> and
<tt class=literal>height</tt> play a dual role. If
<tt class=literal>SOMEBITS</tt> is set, they represent the size of the
chunk of the image that has just been delivered. If
<tt class=literal>HEIGHT</tt> or <tt class=literal>WIDTH</tt> is set, however,
they represent the overall image dimensions. Just for amusement, we
have used the <tt class=literal>java.awt.Rectangle</tt> class to help us
print the bounds of rectangular region.

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>imageUpdate()</tt> returns a
<tt class=literal>boolean</tt> value indicating whether or not it's
interested in future updates. If the image is finished or aborted,
<tt class=literal>imageUpdate()</tt> returns <tt class=literal>false</tt> to
indicate it isn't interested in further updates. Otherwise,
it returns <tt class=literal>true</tt>.

<p class=para>
The following example uses <tt class=literal>MyObserver</tt> to print 
information about an image as AWT loads it: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*; 
 
public class ObserveImage extends java.applet.Applet {  
    Image img; 
    public void init() { 
        img = getImage( getClass().getResource(getParameter("img")) ); 
        MyObserver mo = new MyObserver(); 
        img.getWidth( mo ); 
        img.getHeight( mo ); 
        prepareImage( img, mo ); 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
After requesting the <tt class=literal>Image</tt> object with
<tt class=literal>getImage()</tt>, we perform three operations on it to
kick-start the loading process. <tt class=literal>getWidth()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>getHeight()</tt> ask for the image's width and
height. If the image hasn't been loaded yet, or its size
can't be determined until loading is finished, our observer will
be called when the data is ready. <tt class=literal>prepareImage()</tt>
asks that the image be readied for display on the component. It's a
general mechanism for getting AWT started loading,
converting, and possibly scaling the image. If the image hasn't
been otherwise prepared or displayed, this happens asynchronously, and
our image observer will be notified as the data is constructed.

<p class=para>
You may be wondering where the image consumer is, since we
never see a call to <tt class=literal>imageUpdate()</tt>. That's a
good question, but for now I'd like you to take it on faith that
the consumer exists. As you'll see later, image consumers are
rather mysterious objects that tend to hide beneath the surface of
image-processing applications. In this case, the consumer is hiding
deep inside the implementation of <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>.

<p class=para>
You should be able to see how we could implement all sorts of
sophisticated image loading and tracking schemes. The two most obvious
strategies, however, are to draw an image progressively, as it's
constructed, or to wait until it's complete and draw it in its
entirety. We have already seen that the <tt class=literal>Component</tt>
class implements the first scheme. Another class,
<tt class=literal>java.awt.MediaTracker</tt>, is a general utility that
tracks the loading of a number of images or other media types for
us. We'll look at it next.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-SECT-5.2">Using a MediaTracker</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.MED1"></A><a name="CH11.MED2"></A><tt class=literal>java.awt.MediaTracker</tt> is a utility class that
simplifies life if we have to wait for one or more images to be loaded
before they're displayed. A <tt class=literal>MediaTracker</tt>
monitors the preparation of an image or a group of images and lets us
check on them periodically, or wait until they are
completed. <tt class=literal>MediaTracker</tt> uses the
<tt class=literal>ImageObserver</tt> interface internally to receive image
updates.

<p class=para>
The following applet, <tt class=literal>LoadMe</tt>, uses a
<tt class=literal>MediaTracker</tt> to wait while an image is prepared. It
shows a "Loading..." message while it's waiting. (If you
are retrieving the image from a local disk or very fast network, this
might go by quickly, so pay attention.)

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*;
public class TrackImage extends java.applet.Applet implements Runnable { 
    Image img;
    final int MAIN_IMAGE = 0;
    MediaTracker tracker;
    boolean show = false;
    Thread runme;
    String message = "Loading...";
    public void init() {
        img = getImage( getClass().getResource(getParameter("img")) );
        tracker = new MediaTracker(this);
        tracker.addImage( img, MAIN_IMAGE );
    }
    public void start() {
        if ( !tracker.checkID( MAIN_IMAGE ) ) {
            runme = new Thread( this );
            runme.start();
        }
    }
    public void stop() {
        runme.stop();
        runme = null;
    }
    public void run() {
        repaint();
        try {
            tracker.waitForID( MAIN_IMAGE );
        } catch( InterruptedException e) { }
        if ( tracker.isErrorID( MAIN_IMAGE ) )
            message= "Error";
        else
            show = true;
        repaint();
    }
    public void paint( Graphics g ) {
        if ( show )
            g.drawImage( img, 0, 0, this );
        else {
            g.drawRect( 0, 0, getSize().width-1, getSize().height-1);
            g.drawString( message, 20, 20 );
        }
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
From its <tt class=literal>init()</tt> method, <tt class=literal>LoadMe</tt>
requests its image and creates a <tt class=literal>MediaTracker</tt> to
manage it. Later, after the applet is started,
<tt class=literal>LoadMe</tt> fires up a thread to wait while the image is
loaded. Note that we don't do this in <tt class=literal>init()</tt>
because it would be rude to do anything time-consuming there; it would
take up time in an AWT thread that we don't
own. In this case, waiting in <tt class=literal>init()</tt> would be
especially bad because <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> would never get
called and our "loading" message wouldn't be
displayed; the applet would just hang until the image loaded. It's
often better to create a new thread for initialization and display a
startup message in the interim.

<p class=para>
When we construct a <tt class=literal>MediaTracker</tt>, we give it
a reference to our component (<tt class=literal>this</tt>). After creating
a <tt class=literal>MediaTracker</tt>, we assign it images to manage.
Each image is associated with an integer identifier we'll
use later for checking on its status. Multiple images can be
associated with the same identifier, letting us manage them as a
group. The value of the identifier is also used to prioritize loading
when waiting on multiple sets of images; lower IDs have higher
priority. In this case, we want to manage only a single image, so we
created one identifier called <tt class=literal>MAIN_IMAGE</tt> and passed
it as the ID for our image in the call to
<tt class=literal>addImage()</tt>.

<p class=para>
In our applet's <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method, we
call the <tt class=literal>MediaTracker</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>checkID()</tt> routine with the ID of the image to see
if it's already been loaded. If it hasn't, the applet fires
up a new thread to fetch it. The thread executes the
<tt class=literal>run()</tt> method, which simply calls the
<tt class=literal>MediaTracker</tt> <tt class=literal>waitforID()</tt> routine
and blocks on the image, waiting for it to finish loading. The
<tt class=literal>show</tt> flag tells <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> whether
to display our status message or the actual image. We do a
<tt class=literal>repaint()</tt> immediately upon entering
<tt class=literal>run()</tt> to display the "Loading..."
status, and again upon exiting to change the display. We test for
errors during image preparation with <tt class=literal>isErrorID()</tt>
and change the status message if we find one.

<p class=para>
This may seem like a lot of work to go through, just to put up
a status message while loading a single
image. <tt class=literal>MediaTracker</tt> is more valuable when we are
working with many images that have to be available before we can begin
parts of our application. It saves us from implementing a custom
<tt class=literal>ImageObserver</tt> for every application. In the
future, <tt class=literal>MediaTracker</tt> should also be able to track
the status of audio clips and other kinds of media (as its name
suggests).

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-SECT-5.3">Producing Image Data</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.PROD1"></A><a name="CH11.PROD2"></A>What if we want to make our own image data? To be an image producer,
we have to implement the five methods defined in the
<tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt> interface:
<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt> 

<p>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>startProduction()</tt>

<p>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>isConsumer()</tt>

<p>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>removeConsumer()</tt>

<p>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>requestTopDownLeftRightResend()</tt>

<p>
</UL>

 
 
Four methods of <tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt> simply deal with the
process of registering consumers. <tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt>
takes an <tt class=literal>ImageConsumer</tt> as an argument and adds it
to the list of consumers. Our producer can then start sending image
data to the consumer whenever it's ready.
<tt class=literal>startProduction()</tt> is identical to
<tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt>, except that it asks the producer to
start sending data as soon as possible. The difference might be that a
given producer would send the current frame of data or initiate
construction of a frame immediately, rather than waiting until its
next cycle.
<tt class=literal>isConsumer()</tt> tests whether a particular
consumer is already registered, and <tt class=literal>removeConsumer()</tt>
removes a consumer from the list. We'll see shortly that we can
perform these kinds of operations easily with a
<tt class=literal>Vector</tt>; see <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, <i>Basic Utility Classes</i></A> for a
complete discussion of <tt class=literal>Vector</tt> objects.

<p class=para>
An <tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt> also needs to know how to
use the <tt class=literal>ImageConsumer</tt> interface of its clients. The
final method of the <tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt> interface,
<tt class=literal>requestTopDownLeftRightResend()</tt>, asks that the
image data be resent to the consumer, in order, from beginning to end.
In general, a producer can generate pixel data and send it to the
consumer in any order that it likes. 
The <tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt> method of the
<tt class=literal>ImageConsumer</tt> interface takes parameters telling
the consumer what part of the image is being delivered on each call. A
call to <tt class=literal>requestTopDownLeftRightResend()</tt> asks the
producer to send the pixel data again, in order. A consumer might do
this so that it can use a higher quality conversion algorithm that
relies on receiving the pixel data in sequence. It's important to
note that the producer is allowed to ignore this request; it
doesn't have to be able to send the data in sequence.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-SECT-5.3.1">Color models</A></h4>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.COLOR1"></A><a name="CH11.COLOR2"></A><a name="CH11.COLOR3"></A>Everybody wants to work with color in their application, but using color
raises problems. The most important problem is simply how to
represent a color. There are many different ways to encode color
information: red, green, blue (RGB) values; hue,
saturation, value (HSV); hue, lightness, saturation
(HLS); and more. In addition, you can provide full
color information for each pixel, or you can just specify an index into
a color table (palette) for each pixel. The way you represent a color
is called a <i class=emphasis>color model</I>. AWT
provides tools for two broad groups of color models:
<i class=emphasis>direct</I> and <i class=emphasis>indexed</I>.

<p class=para>
As you might expect, you need to specify a color model in order
to generate pixel data; the <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> class
<tt class=literal>java.awt.image.ColorModel</tt> represents a color
model. A <tt class=literal>ColorModel</tt> is one of the arguments to the
<tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt> method an image producer calls to
deliver pixels to a consumer. What you probably wouldn't expect
is that you can use a different color model every time you call
<tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt>. Exactly why you'd do this is
another matter. Most of the time, you'll want to work with a
single color model; that model will probably be the default direct
color model. But the additional flexibility is there if you need it.

<p class=para>
By default, the core AWT components use a direct
color model called ARGB. The A stands for
"alpha,", which is the historical name for
transparency. RGB refers to the red, green, and
blue color components that are combined to produce a single, composite
color. In the default ARGB model, each pixel is
represented by a 32-bit integer that is interpreted as four 8-bit
fields; in order, the fields represent the transparency (A), red,
green, and blue components of the color, as shown in 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-14-FIG-3">Figure 14.3</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-FIG-3">Figure 14.3: ARGB color encoding</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je1403.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 14-3]" width=503 height=128 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
To create an instance of the default ARGB
model, call the <tt class=literal>static</tt>
<tt class=literal>getRGBdefault()</tt> method in
<tt class=literal>ColorModel</tt>. This method returns a
<tt class=literal>DirectColorModel</tt> object;
<tt class=literal>DirectColorModel</tt> is a subclass of
<tt class=literal>ColorModel</tt>. You can also create other direct color
models by calling a <tt class=literal>DirectColorModel</tt> constructor,
but you shouldn't need to unless you have a fairly exotic
application.

<p class=para>
In an indexed color model, each pixel is represented by a
smaller amount of information: an index into a table of real color
values. For some applications, generating data with an indexed model
may be more convenient. If you have an 8-bit display or smaller, using
an indexed model may be more efficient, since your hardware is
internally using an indexed color model of some form.

<p class=para>
While AWT provides
<tt class=literal>IndexedColorModel</tt> objects, we won't cover
them in this book. It's sufficient to work with the
<tt class=literal>DirectColorModel</tt>. Even if you have an 8-bit
display, the Java implementation on your platform should accommodate
the hardware you have and, if necessary, dither colors to fit your
display. Java also produces transparency on systems that don't
natively support it by dithering colors.

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-SECT-5.3.2">Creating an image</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Let's take a look at producing some image data. A picture may be
worth a thousand words, but fortunately, we can generate a picture in
significantly fewer than a thousand words of Java. If we're
interested in producing a static image with just one frame, we can use
a utility class that acts as an <tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt> for
us.

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>java.awt.image.MemoryImageSource</tt> is a simple
utility class that implements the <tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt>
interface; we give it pixel data in an array and it sends that data to
an image consumer. A <tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt> can be
constructed for a given color model, with various options to specify
the type and positioning of its data. We'll use the simplest
form, which assumes an ARGB color model.

<p class=para>
The following applet, <tt class=literal>ColorPan</tt>, creates an image 
from an array of integers holding ARGB pixel values: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.image.*;
public class ColorPan extends java.applet.Applet { 
    Image img;
    int width, height;
    int [] pixData;
    public void init() {
        width = getSize().width;
        height = getSize().height;
        pixData = new int [width * height];
        int i=0;
        for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++) {
            int red = (y * 255) / (height - 1);
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++) {
                int green = (x * 255) / (width - 1);
                int blue = 128;
                int alpha = 255;
                pixData[i++] = (alpha &lt;&lt; 24) | (red &lt;&lt; 16) | 
                               (green &lt;&lt; 8 ) | blue;
            }
        }
    }
    public void paint( Graphics g ) {
        if ( img == null )
            img = createImage( new MemoryImageSource(width, height, 
                                          pixData, 0, width));
        g.drawImage( img, 0, 0, this );
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Give it a try. The size of the image is determined by the size of the
applet when it starts up. What you should get is a very colorful box
that pans from deep blue at the upper left-hand corner to bright
yellow at the bottom right with green and red at the other
extremes. (You'll have to imagine something more colorful than the
black and white image above.)

<p class=para>
We create the pixel data for our image in the
<tt class=literal>init()</tt>method, and then use
<tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt> to create and display the image
in <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>. The variable <tt class=literal>pixData</tt>
is a one-dimensional array of integers that holds 32-bit
ARGB pixel values. In <tt class=literal>init()</tt> we
loop over every pixel in the image and assign it an
ARGB value. The alpha (transparency) component is
always 255, which means the image is opaque. The blue component
is always 128, half its maximum intensity. The red component varies
from 0 to 255 along the y axis; likewise, the green component varies
from 0 to 255 along the x axis. The line below combines these
components into an ARGB value:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
pixData[i++] = (alpha &lt;&lt; 24) | (red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8 ) | blue; 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The bitwise left-shift operator (<tt class=literal>&lt;&lt;</tt>) should
be familiar to C programmers. It simply shoves the bits over by the
specified number of positions. The alpha value takes the top byte of
the integer, followed by the red, green, and blue values.

<p class=para>
When we construct the <tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt> as a
producer for this data, we give it five parameters: the width and
height of the image to construct (in pixels), the
<tt class=literal>pixData</tt> array, an offset into that array, and the
width of each scan line (in pixels). We'll start with the first
element (offset 0) of <tt class=literal>pixData</tt>; the width of each
scan line and the width of the image are the same. The array
<tt class=literal>pixData</tt> has <tt class=literal>width * height</tt>
elements, which means it has one element for each pixel.

<p class=para>
We create the actual image once, in <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>,
using the <tt class=literal>createImage()</tt> method that our applet
inherits from <tt class=literal>Component</tt>. In the double-buffering
and off-screen drawing examples, we used
<tt class=literal>createImage()</tt> to give us an empty off-screen image
buffer. Here we use <tt class=literal>createImage()</tt> to generate an
image from a specified <tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt>.
<tt class=literal>createImage()</tt> creates the <tt class=literal>Image</tt>
object and receives pixel data from the producer to construct the
image. Note that there's nothing particularly special about
<tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt>; we could use any object that
implements the image-producer interface inside of
<tt class=literal>createImage()</tt>, including one we wrote
ourselves. Once we have the image, we can draw it on the display with
the familiar <tt class=literal>drawImage()</tt> method. 

<p class=para>
You can use <tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt> to produce
complex, pixel-by-pixel graphics or render images from arbitrary
sources. It produces static images, though; when it reaches the
end of its pixel data, its job is done. To generate a stream of image
data or update pixel values, we need a more persistent image producer.

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch14-SECT3-AUTOID.1">Updating a MemoryImageSource</A></h4>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt> can also be used to
generate a sequence of images, or to update an image dynamically. In
Java 1.1, this is probably the easiest way to build your own low-level
animation software. This example simulates the static on a television
screen. It generates successive frames of random black and white
pixels and displays each frame when it is complete. The figure below
shows one frame of random static, followed by the code:

</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>init()</tt> method sets up the
<tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt> that produces the
sequence of images. It first computes the size of the array needed to
hold the image data. It then creates a
<tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt> object that produces
images the width and height of the display, using the default color
model (the constructor we use assumes that we want the default). We
start taking pixels from the beginning of the pixel array, and scan
lines in the array have the same width as the image. Once we have
created the <tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt>, we call its
<tt class=literal>setAnimated()</tt> method to tell it that we
will be generating an image sequence. Then we use the source to create
an <tt class=literal>Image</tt> that will display our sequence. 

<p class=para>
We next start a thread that generates the pixel data. For every
element in the array, we get a random number, and set the pixel to
black if the random number is greater than 0.5. Because
<tt class=literal>pixels</tt> is an
<tt class=literal>int</tt> array, we can't assign
<tt class=literal>Color</tt> objects to it directly; we use
<tt class=literal>getRGB()</tt> to extract the color components
from the black and white <tt class=literal>Color</tt> constants.
When we have filled the entire array with data, we call the
<tt class=literal>newPixels()</tt> method, which delivers the new
data to the image. 

<p class=para>
That's about all there is. We provide a very uninteresting
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method, that just calls
<tt class=literal>drawImage()</tt> to put the current state of
the image on the screen. Whenever <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>
is called, we see the latest collection of static. The image observer,
which is the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> itself, schedules a
call to <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> whenever anything
interesting has happened to the image. It's worth noting
how simple it is to create this animation. Once we have the
<tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt>, we use it to create an
image that we treat like any other image. The code that generates the
image sequence can be arbitrarily complex--certainly in any reasonable
example, it would be more complex than our (admittedly cheesy) static.
But that complexity never infects the simple task of getting the image
on the screen and updating it.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-SECT-5.4">Image Producers and Consumers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.UP1"></A>In this section we'll create an image producer that generates a
stream of image frames rather than just a static image. Unfortunately,
it would take too many lines of code to generate anything really
interesting, so we'll stick with a simple modification of our
<tt class=literal>ColorPan</tt> example. After all, figuring out what to
display is your job; I'm primarily concerned with giving you the
necessary tools. After this, you should have the needed tools to
implement more interesting applications.

<p class=para>
A word of advice: if you find yourself writing image producers, you're
probably making your life excessively difficult. Most situations can
be handled by the dynamic
<tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt> technique that we just
demonstrated. Before going to the trouble of writing an image
producer, convince yourself that there isn't a simpler solution. Even
if you never write an image producer yourself, it's good (like
Motherhood and Apple Pie) to understand how Java's image rendering
tools work. 

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-SECT-5.4.1">Image consumers</A></h4>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.CONS1"></A>First, we have to know a little more about the image consumers
we'll be feeding. An image consumer implements the seven methods
that are defined in the <tt class=literal>ImageConsumer</tt>
interface. Two of these methods are overloaded versions of the
<tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt> method that accept the actual pixel
data for a region of the image. They are identical except that one
takes the pixel data as an array of integers, and the other uses an
array of bytes. (An array of bytes is natural when you're using
an indexed color model because each pixel is specified by an index
into a color array.) A call to <tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt> looks
something like the following:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
setPixels(x, y, width, height, colorModel, pixels, offset, scanLength); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>pixels</tt> is the one-dimensional array of bytes or
integers that holds the pixel data. Often, you deliver only part of
the image with each call to <tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt>. The
<tt class=literal>x</tt>, <tt class=literal>y</tt>, <tt class=literal>width</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>height</tt> values define the rectangle of the image
for which pixels are being delivered. <tt class=literal>x</tt> and
<tt class=literal>y</tt> specify the upper left-hand corner of the chunk
you're delivering, relative to the upper left-hand corner of the
image as a whole. <tt class=literal>width</tt> specifies the width in
pixels of the chunk; <tt class=literal>height</tt> specifies the number of
scan lines in the chunk. <tt class=literal>offset</tt> specifies the point
in <tt class=literal>pixels</tt> at which the data being delivered in this
call to <tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt> starts. Finally,
<tt class=literal>scanLength</tt> indicates the width of the entire image,
which is not necessarily the same as
<tt class=literal>width</tt>. The <tt class=literal>pixels</tt>
array must be large enough to accommodate
<tt class=literal>width*length+offset</tt> elements; if it's larger, any
leftover data is ignored.

<p class=para>
We haven't said anything yet about the
<tt class=literal>colorModel</tt> argument to
<tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt>. In our previous example, we drew our
image using the default ARGB color model for pixel
values; the version of the <tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt>
constructor that we used supplied the default color model for us. In
this example, we also stick with the default model, but this time we
have to specify it explicitly. The remaining five methods of the
<tt class=literal>ImageConsumer</tt> interface accept general attributes
and framing information about the image:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>setHints()</tt>

<p>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>setDimensions()</tt>

<p>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>setProperties()</tt>

<p>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>setColorModel()</tt>

<p>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>imageComplete()</tt>

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
 
Before delivering any data to a consumer, the producer should call the
consumer's <tt class=literal>setHints()</tt> method to pass it
information about how pixels will be delivered. Hints are
specified in the form of flags defined in the
<tt class=literal>ImageConsumer</tt> interface. The flags are described in
<a href="#EXJ-CH-14-TAB-2">Table 14.2</A>. The consumer uses these hints to
optimize the way it builds the image; it's also free to ignore them.

<tt class=literal>setDimensions()</tt> is called to pass the width

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>setProperties()</tt> is used to pass a hashtable
of image properties, stored by name. This method isn't
particularly useful without some prior agreement between the producer
and consumer about what properties are meaningful. For example, image
formats such as GIF and TIFF can
include additional information about the image. These image attributes
could be delivered to the consumer in the hashtable.

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>setColorModel()</tt> is called to tell the
consumer which color model will be used to process most of the pixel
data. However, remember that each call to
<tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt> also specifies a
<tt class=literal>ColorModel</tt> for its group of pixels. The color model
specified in <tt class=literal>setColorModel()</tt> is really only a hint
that the consumer can use for optimization. You're not required
to use this color model to deliver all (or for that matter, any) of
the pixels in the image.

<p class=para>
The producer calls the consumer's
<tt class=literal>imageComplete()</tt> method when it has completely
delivered the image or a frame of an image sequence. If the consumer
doesn't wish to receive further frames of the image, it should
unregister itself from the producer at this point. The producer
passes a status flag formed from the flags shown in 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-14-TAB-3">Table 14.3</A>.

As you can see, the <tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt> and
<tt class=literal>ImageConsumer</tt> interfaces provide a very flexible
mechanism for distributing image data. Now let's look at a
simple producer.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-SECT-5.4.2">A sequence of images</A></h4>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.SEQ"></A>The following class, <tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt>, shows how to
implement an <tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt> that generates a
sequence of images. The images are a lot like the
<tt class=literal>ColorPan</tt> image we generated a few pages back,
except that the blue component of each pixel changes with every
frame. This image producer doesn't do anything you couldn't do with a
<tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt>.  It reads
ARGB data from an array, and consults the object
that creates the array to give it an opportunity to update the data
between each frame.

<p class=para>
This is a complex example, so before diving into the code,
let's take a broad look at the pieces. The
<tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt> class is an image producer; it
generates data and sends it to image consumers to be displayed. To
make our design more modular, we define an interface called
<tt class=literal>FrameARGBData</tt> that describes how our rendering code
provides each frame of ARGB pixel data to our
producer. To do the computation and provide the raw bits, we create a
class called <tt class=literal>ColorPanCycle</tt> that implements
<tt class=literal>FrameARGBData</tt>. This means that
<tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt> doesn't care specifically where
the data comes from; if we wanted to draw different images, we could
just drop in another class, provided that the new class implements
<tt class=literal>FrameARGBData</tt>. Finally, we create an applet called
<tt class=literal>UpdatingImage</tt> that includes two image consumers to
display the data.

<p class=para>
Here's the <tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt> class:

<p class=para>
The bulk of the code in <tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt> creates the
skeleton we need for implementing the <tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt>
interface. <tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt> is actually a simple
subclass of <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> whose <tt class=literal>run()</tt>
method loops, generating and sending a frame of data on each
iteration. The <tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt> constructor takes two
items: a <tt class=literal>FrameARGBData</tt> object that updates the
array of pixel data for each frame, and an integer that specifies the
maximum number of frames per second to generate. We give the thread a
low priority (<tt class=literal>MIN_PRIORITY+1</tt>) so that it
can't run away with all of our CPU time.

<p class=para>
Our <tt class=literal>FrameARGBData</tt> object implements the following 
interface: 

<div class=programlisting>

    int [] getPixels(); 
    void nextFrame();

<p class=para>
In <tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt>'s <tt class=literal>run()</tt>
method, we call <tt class=literal>nextFrame()</tt> to compute the array of
pixels for each frame. After computing the pixels, we call our own
<tt class=literal>sendFrame()</tt> method to deliver the data to the
consumers. <tt class=literal>sendFrame()</tt> calls
<tt class=literal>getPixels()</tt> to retrieve the updated array of pixel
data from the <tt class=literal>FrameARGBData</tt> object.
<tt class=literal>sendFrame()</tt> then sends the new data to all of the
consumers by invoking each of their <tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt>
methods and signaling the end of the frame with
<tt class=literal>imageComplete()</tt>. Note that
<tt class=literal>sendFrame()</tt> can handle multiple consumers; it
iterates through a <tt class=literal>Vector</tt> of image consumers. In a
more realistic implementation, we would also check for errors and
notify the consumers if any occurred.

<p class=para>
The business of managing the <tt class=literal>Vector</tt> of
consumers is handled by <tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt> and the other
methods in the <tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt>
interface. <tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt> adds an item to
<tt class=literal>consumers</tt>. A <tt class=literal>Vector</tt> is a
perfect tool for this task, since it's an automatically extendable
array, with methods for finding out how many elements it has, whether
or not a given element is already a member, and so on.

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt> also gives the consumer hints
about how the data will be delivered by calling
<tt class=literal>setHints()</tt>. This image provider always works from
top to bottom and left to right, and makes only one pass through the
data. <tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt> next gives the consumer an
empty hashtable of image properties. Finally, it reports that most of
the pixels will use the default ARGB color model
(we initialized the variable <tt class=literal>model</tt> to
<tt class=literal>ColorModel.getRGBDefault()</tt>). In this example, we
always start sending image data on the next frame, so
<tt class=literal>startProduction()</tt> simply calls
<tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt>.

<p class=para>
We've discussed the mechanism for communications
between the consumer and producer, but I haven't yet told you
where the data comes from. We have a <tt class=literal>FrameARGBData</tt>
interface that defines how to retrieve the data, but we don't
yet have an object that implements the interface. The following class,
<tt class=literal>ColorPanCycle</tt>, implements
<tt class=literal>FrameARGBData</tt>; we'll use it to generate our
pixels:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*;
class ColorPanCycle implements FrameARGBData {
    int frame = 0, width, height;
    private int [] pixels;
    ColorPanCycle ( int w, int h ) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
        pixels = new int [ width * height ];
        nextFrame();
    }
    public synchronized int [] getPixels() {
        return pixels;
    }
    public synchronized void nextFrame() {
        int index = 0;
        for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++) {
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++) {
                int red = (y * 255) / (height - 1);
                int green = (x * 255) / (width - 1);
                int blue = (frame * 10) &amp; 0xff;
                pixels[index++] = 
                    (255 &lt;&lt; 24) | (red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue;
            }
        }
        frame++;
    }
    public Dimension size() {
        return new Dimension ( width, height );
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>ColorPanCycle</tt> is like our previous
<tt class=literal>ColorPan</tt> example, except that it adjusts each
pixel's blue component each time <tt class=literal>nextFrame()</tt> is
called. This should produce a color cycling effect; as time goes
on, the image becomes more blue.

<p class=para>
Now let's put the pieces together by writing an applet
that displays a sequence of changing images:
<tt class=literal>UpdatingImage</tt>. In fact, we'll do better than
displaying one sequence. To prove that
<tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt> really can deal with multiple
consumers, <tt class=literal>UpdatingImage</tt> creates two components that
display different views of the image. Once the mechanism has been set
up, it's surprising how little code you need to add additional
displays.

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.image.*;
public class UpdatingImage extends java.applet.Applet { 
    ImageSequence seq;
    public void init() {
        seq = new ImageSequence( new ColorPanCycle(100, 100), 10);
        setLayout( null );
        add( new ImageCanvas( seq, 50, 50 ) );
        add( new ImageCanvas( seq, 100, 100 ) );
        seq.start();
    }
    public void stop() {
        if ( seq != null ) {
            seq.stop();
            seq = null;
        }
    }
}
class ImageCanvas extends Canvas { 
    Image img;
    ImageProducer source;
    ImageCanvas ( ImageProducer p, int w, int h ) {
        source = p;
        setSize( w, h );
    }
    public void update( Graphics g ) {
        paint(g);
    }
    public void paint( Graphics g ) {
        if ( img == null )
            img = createImage( source );
        g.drawImage( img, 0, 0, getSize().width, getSize().height, this );
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>UpdatingImage</tt> constructs a new
<tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt> producer with an instance of our
<tt class=literal>ColorPanCycle</tt> object as its frame source. It then
creates two <tt class=literal>ImageCanvas</tt> components that create and
display the two views of our animation. <tt class=literal>ImageCanvas</tt>
is a subclass of <tt class=literal>Canvas</tt>; it takes an
<tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt> and a width and height in its
constructor and creates and displays an appropriately scaled version
of the image in its <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method.
<tt class=literal>UpdatingImage</tt> places the smaller view on top of the
larger one for a sort of "picture in picture" effect.

<p class=para>
If you've followed the example to this point,
you're probably wondering where in the heck is the image consumer. 
After all, we spent a lot of time writing methods in
<tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt> for the consumer to call. If you look
back at the code, you'll see that an
<tt class=literal>ImageSequence</tt> object gets passed to the
<tt class=literal>ImageCanvas</tt> constructor, and that this object is
used as an argument to <tt class=literal>createImage()</tt>. But nobody
appears to call <tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt>. And the image
producer calls <tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt> and other consumer
methods; but it always digs a consumer out of its
<tt class=literal>Vector</tt> of registered consumers, so we never see
where these consumers come from.

<p class=para>
In <tt class=literal>UpdatingImage</tt>, the image consumer is
behind the scenes, hidden deep inside the
<tt class=literal>Canvas</tt>--in fact, inside the
<tt class=literal>Canvas</tt>' peer. The call to
<tt class=literal>createImage()</tt> tells its component (i.e., our
canvas) to become an image consumer. Something deep inside the
component is calling <tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt> behind our backs
and registering a mysterious consumer, and that consumer is the one
the producer uses in calls to <tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt> and other
methods. We haven't implemented any
<tt class=literal>ImageConsumer</tt> objects in this book because, as you
might imagine, most image consumers are implemented in native code,
since they need to display things on the screen. There are others
though; the <tt class=literal>java.awt.image.PixelGrabber</tt> class is a
consumer that returns the pixel data as a byte array. You might use it
to save an image. You can make your own consumer do anything you like
with pixel data from a producer. But in reality, you rarely need to
write an image consumer yourself. Let them stay hidden; take it on
faith that they exist.

<p class=para>
Now for the next question: How does the screen get updated?
Even though we are updating the consumer with new data, the new image
will not appear on the display unless the applet repaints it
periodically. By now, this part of the machinery should be familiar:
what we need is an image observer. Remember that all components are
image observers (i.e., the class <tt class=literal>Component</tt>
implements <tt class=literal>ImageObserver</tt>). The call to
<tt class=literal>drawImage()</tt> specifies our
<tt class=literal>ImageCanvas</tt> as its image observer. The default
<tt class=literal>Component</tt> class-image-observer functionality then
repaints our image whenever new pixel data arrives.

<p class=para>
In this example, we haven't bothered to stop and start
our applet properly; it continues running and wasting
CPU time even when it's invisible. There are two
strategies for stopping and restarting our thread. We can destroy the
thread and create a new one, which would require recreating our
<tt class=literal>ImageCanvas</tt> objects, or we could suspend and resume
the active thread. As discussed in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, <i>Threads</i></A>, neither
option is particularly difficult.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-14-SECT-5.5">Filtering Image Data</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.FILT1"></A><a name="CH11.FILT2"></A><a name="CH11.FILT3"></A>As I said above, you rarely need to write an image consumer. However,
there is one kind of image consumer that's worth knowing
about. In this final section on images, we'll build a simple
image filter. An image filter is simply a class that performs some
work on image data before passing the data to another consumer.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>ColorSep</tt> applet acquires an image; uses
an image filter to separate the image into red, green, and blue
components; and displays the three resulting images. With this applet
and a few million dollars, you could build your own color separation
plant.

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.image.*;
public class ColorSep extends java.applet.Applet { 
    Image img, redImg, greenImg, blueImg;
    public void init() {
        img = getImage( getClass().getResource( getParameter("img")) );
        redImg = createImage(new FilteredImageSource(img.getSource(), 
                                        new ColorMaskFilter( Color.red )));
        greenImg = createImage(new FilteredImageSource(img.getSource(), 
                                        new ColorMaskFilter( Color.green )));
        blueImg = createImage(new FilteredImageSource(img.getSource(), 
                                        new ColorMaskFilter( Color.blue )));
    }
    public void paint( Graphics g ) {
        int width = getSize().width, height = getSize().height;
        g.drawImage( redImg, 0, 0, width/3, height, this );
        g.drawImage( greenImg, width/3, 0, width/3, height, this );
        g.drawImage( blueImg, 2*width/3, 0, width/3, height, this );
    }
}
class ColorMaskFilter extends RGBImageFilter {
    Color color;
    ColorMaskFilter( Color mask ) {
        color = mask;
        canFilterIndexColorModel = true;
    }
    public int filterRGB(int x, int y, int pixel ) {
        return 
            255 &lt;&lt; 24 |
            (((pixel &amp; 0xff0000) &gt;&gt; 16) * color.getRed()/255) &lt;&lt; 16 |
            (((pixel &amp; 0xff00) &gt;&gt; 8) * color.getGreen()/255) &lt;&lt; 8 |
            (pixel &amp; 0xff) * color.getBlue()/255 ;
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>FilteredImageSource</tt> and
<tt class=literal>RGBImageFilter</tt> classes form the basis for building
and using image filters. A <tt class=literal>FilteredImageSource</tt> is
an image producer (like <tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt>) that is
constructed from an image and an <tt class=literal>ImageFilter</tt>
object. It fetches pixel data from the image and feeds it through the
image filter before passing the data along. Because
<tt class=literal>FilteredImageSource</tt> is an image producer, we can
use it in our calls to <tt class=literal>createImage()</tt>.

<p class=para>
But where's the consumer?
<tt class=literal>FilteredImageSource</tt> obviously consumes image data
as well as producing it. The image consumer is still mostly hidden,
but is peeking out from under its rock. Our class
<tt class=literal>ColorMaskFilter</tt> extends
<tt class=literal>RGBImageFilter</tt>, which in turn extends
<tt class=literal>ImageFilter</tt>. And <tt class=literal>ImageFilter</tt> is
(finally!) an image consumer. Of course, we still don't see the
calls to <tt class=literal>addConsumer()</tt>, and we don't see an
implementation of <tt class=literal>setPixels()</tt>; they're hidden
in the <tt class=literal>ImageFilter</tt> sources and inherited by
<tt class=literal>ColorMaskFilter</tt>.

<p class=para>
So what does <tt class=literal>ColorMaskFilter</tt> actually do?
Not much. <tt class=literal>ColorMaskFilter</tt> is a simple subclass of
<tt class=literal>RGBImageFilter</tt> that implements one method,
<tt class=literal>filterRGB()</tt>, through which all of the pixel data
are fed. Its constructor saves a mask value we use for
filtering. The <tt class=literal>filterRGB()</tt> method accepts a
<tt class=literal>pixel</tt> value, along with its <tt class=literal>x</tt>
and <tt class=literal>y</tt> coordinates, and returns the filtered version
of the pixel. In <tt class=literal>ColorMaskFilter</tt>, we simply
multiply the color components by the mask color to get the proper
effect. A more complex filter, however, might use the coordinates to
change its behavior based on the pixel's position.

<p class=para>
One final detail: the constructor for
<tt class=literal>ColorMaskFilter</tt> sets the flag
<tt class=literal>canFilterIndexColorModel</tt>. This flag is inherited
from <tt class=literal>RGBImageFilter</tt>. It means our filter
doesn't depend on the pixel's position. In turn, this
means it can filter the colors in a color table. If
we were using an indexed color model, filtering the color table would
be much faster than filtering the individual pixels.
