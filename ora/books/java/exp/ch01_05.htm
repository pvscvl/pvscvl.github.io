<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.ENCAP2"></A><a name="CH01.ENCAP1"></A>It's one thing to create a language that prevents you from shooting
yourself in the foot; it's quite another to create one that prevents
others from shooting you in the foot.

<p class=para>
Encapsulation is a technique for hiding data and behavior
within a class; it's an important part of object-oriented design. It
helps you write clean, modular software. In most languages however,
the visibility of data items is simply part of the relationship
between the programmer and the compiler.  It's a matter of semantics,
not an assertion about the actual security of the data in the context
of the running program's environment.

<p class=para>
When Bjarne Stroustrup chose the keyword
<tt class=literal>private</tt> to designate hidden members of classes in
C++, he was probably thinking about shielding you from the messy
details of a class developer's code, not the issues of shielding
that developer's classes and objects from the onslaught of
someone else's viruses and trojan horses. Arbitrary casting and
pointer arithmetic in C or C++ make it trivial to violate access
permissions on classes without breaking the rules of the
language. Consider the following code:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
// C++  
 
class Finances { 
    private: 
        char creditCardNumber[16]; 
        ... 
    }; 
 
main() { 
    Finances finances; 
 
    // Forge a pointer to peek inside the class 
    char *cardno = (char *)finances; 
    printf("Card Number = %s\n", cardno); 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In this little C++ drama, we have written some code that
violates the encapsulation of the <tt class=literal>Finances</tt> class
and pulls out some secret information. If this example seems
unrealistic, consider how important it is to protect the foundation
(system) classes of the run-time environment from similar kinds of
attacks. If untrusted code can corrupt the components that provide
access to real resources, such as the filesystem, the network, or the
windowing system, it certainly has a chance at stealing your
credit card numbers.

<p class=para>
In Visual BASIC, it's also possible to
compromise the system by peeking, poking, and, under
DOS, installing interrupt handlers. Even some
recent languages that have some commonalities with Java lack important
security features. For example, the Apple Newton uses an
object-oriented language called NewtonScript that is compiled into an
interpreted byte-code format.  However, NewtonScript has no concept of
public and private members, so a Newton application has free reign to
access any information it finds.  General Magic's Telescript
language is another example of a device-independent language that does
not fully address security concerns.

<p class=para>
If a Java application is to dynamically download code from an
untrusted source on the Internet and run it alongside applications
that might contain confidential information, protection has to extend
very deep. The Java security model wraps three layers of protection
around imported classes, as shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-1-FIG-3">Figure 1.3</A>.

</DIV>

<p class=para>
At the outside, application-level security decisions are made
by a security manager. A security manager controls access to system
resources like the filesystem, network ports, and the windowing
environment. A security manager relies on the ability of a class
loader to protect basic system classes.  A class loader handles
loading classes from the network. At the inner level, all system
security ultimately rests on the Java verifier, which guarantees the
integrity of incoming classes.

<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.VERIFY1"></A><a name="CH01.VERIFY2"></A>The Java byte-code verifier is an integral part of the Java
run-time system.  Class loaders and security managers, however, are
implemented by applications that load applets, such as applet viewers
and Web browsers. All these pieces need to be functioning properly
to ensure security in the Java environment.[4]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[4] 
You may have seen reports about various security flaws in Java. While
these weaknesses are real, it's important to realize that they have
been found in the implementations of various components, namely
Sun's byte-code verifier and Netscape's class loader and
security manager, not in the basic security model itself. One of the
reasons Sun has released the source code for Java is to encourage
people to search for weaknesses, so they can be removed.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-5.1">The Verifier</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java's first line of defense is the byte-code
<i class=emphasis>verifier</I>. The verifier reads byte-code before
they are run and makes sure they are well-behaved and obey the
basic rules of the Java language. A trusted Java compiler won't
produce code that does otherwise. However, it's possible for a
mischievous person to deliberately assemble bad code. It's the
verifier's job to detect this.

<p class=para>
Once code has been verified, it's considered safe from
certain inadvertent or malicious errors. For example, verified code
can't forge pointers or violate access permissions on objects. It
can't perform illegal casts or use objects in ways other than they
are intended. It can't even cause certain types of internal errors,
such as overflowing or underflowing the operand stack. These
fundamental guarantees underlie all of Java's security.

<p class=para>
You might be wondering, isn't this kind of safety
implicit in lots of interpreted languages? Well, while it's true that
you shouldn't be able to corrupt the interpreter with bogus
BASIC code, remember that the protection in most
interpreted languages happens at a higher level.  Those languages are
likely to have heavyweight interpreters that do a great deal of
run-time work, so they are necessarily slower and more cumbersome.

<p class=para>
By comparison, Java byte-code is a relatively light, low-level
instruction set. The ability to statically verify the Java byte-code
before execution lets the Java interpreter run at full speed with full
safety, without expensive run-time checks. Of course, you are always
going to pay the price of running an interpreter, but that's not
a serious problem with the speed of modern
CPUs. Java byte-code can also be compiled on the
fly to native machine code, which has even less run-time overhead.

<p class=para>
The verifier is a type of theorem prover. It steps through the
Java byte-code and applies simple, inductive rules to determine
certain aspects of how the byte-code will behave. This kind of
analysis is possible because compiled Java byte-code has a lot more
type information stored within it than other languages of this
kind. The byte-code also has to obey a few extra rules that simplify
its behavior. First, most byte-code instructions operate only on
individual data types.  For example, with stack operations, there are
separate instructions for object references and for each of the
numeric types in Java. Similarly, there is a different instruction for
moving each type of value into and out of a local variable.

<p class=para>
Second, the type of object resulting from any operation is
always known in advance. There are no byte-code operations that
consume values and produce more than one possible type of value as
output. As a result, it's always possible to look at the next
instruction and its operands, and know the type of value that will
result.

<p class=para>
Because an operation always produces a known type, by looking
at the starting state, it's possible to determine the types of all
items on the stack and in local variables at any point in the
future. The collection of all this type information at any given
time is called the <i class=emphasis>type state</I> of the stack; this
is what Java tries to analyze before it runs an application. Java
doesn't know anything about the actual values of stack and
variable items at this time, just what kind of items they
are. However, this is enough information to enforce the security rules
and to insure that objects are not manipulated illegally.

<p class=para>
To make it feasible to analyze the type state of the stack,
Java places an additional restriction on how Java byte-code
instructions are executed: all paths to the same point in the code
have to arrive with exactly the same type state.[5]
 This restriction makes it possible for the verifier to trace each
branch of the code just once and still know the type state at all
points. Thus, the verifier can insure that instruction types and stack
value types always correspond, without actually following the
execution of the code.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[5] 
The implications of this rule are mainly of interest to compiler
writers.  The rule means that Java byte-code can't perform certain
types of iterative actions within a single frame of execution. A
common example would be looping and pushing values onto the
stack. This is not allowed because the path of execution would return
to the top of the loop with a potentially different type state on each
pass, and there is no way that a static analysis of the code can
determine whether it obeys the security rules.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-5.2">Class Loader</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java adds a second layer of security with a <i class=emphasis>class
loader</I>.  A class loader is responsible for bringing Java
binary classes that contain byte-code into the interpreter. Every
application that loads classes from the network must use a class
loader to handle this task.

<p class=para>
After a class has been loaded and passed through the verifier,
it remains associated with its class loader. As a result, classes are
effectively partitioned into separate namespaces based on their
origin. When a class references another class, the request is served
by its original class loader.  This means that classes retrieved from
a specific source can be restricted to interact only with other
classes retrieved from that same location.  For example, a
Java-enabled Web browser can use a class loader to build a separate
space for all the classes loaded from a given uniform resource
locator (URL).

<p class=para>
The search for classes always begins with the built-in Java
system classes.  These classes are loaded from the locations specified
by the Java interpreter's class path (see <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, <i>Tools of the Trade</i></A>). Classes in the class path are loaded by the
system only once and can't be replaced. This means that it's
impossible for an applet to replace fundamental system classes with
its own versions that change their functionality.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-1-SECT-5.3">Security Manager</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.SM7"></A>Finally, a security manager is responsible for making
application-level security decisions. A security manager is an object
that can be installed by an application to restrict access to system
resources. The security manager is consulted every time the
application tries to access items like the filesystem, network ports,
external processes, and the windowing environment, so the security
manager can allow or deny the request.

<p class=para>
A security manager is most useful for applications that run
untrusted code as part of their normal operation. Since a Java-enabled
Web browser can run applets that may be retrieved from untrusted
sources on the Net, such a browser needs to install a security manager
as one of its first actions.  This security manager then restricts
the kinds of access allowed after that point. This lets the
application impose an effective level of trust before running an
arbitrary piece of code. And once a security manager is installed, it
can't be replaced.

<p class=para>
A security manager can be as simple or complex as a particular
application warrants. Sometimes it's sufficient simply to deny access
to all resources or to general categories of services such as the
filesystem or network.  But it's also possible to make sophisticated
decisions based on high-level information. For example, a Java-enabled
Web browser could implement a security manager that lets users
specify how much an applet is to be trusted or that allows or denies
access to specific resources on a case-by-case basis. Of course, this
assumes that the browser can determine which applets it ought to
trust. We'll see how this problem is solved shortly.

<p class=para>
The integrity of a security manager is based on the protection
afforded by the lower levels of the Java security model. Without the
guarantees provided by the verifier and the class loader, high-level
assertions about the safety of system resources are meaningless. The
safety provided by the Java byte-code verifier means that the
interpreter can't be corrupted or subverted, and that Java code has to
use components as they are intended. This, in turn, means that a
class loader can guarantee that an application is using the core Java
system classes and that these classes are the only means of accessing
basic system resources. With these restrictions in place, it's
possible to centralize control over those resources with a security
manager.
