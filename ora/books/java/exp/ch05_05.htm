<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5">5.5 Subclassing and Inheritance</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.IN1"></A><a name="CH05.IN2"></A>Classes in Java exist in a class hierarchy. A class in Java can be declared 
as a <i class=emphasis>subclass</I> of another class using the <tt class=literal>extends</tt> 
keyword. A subclass <i class=emphasis>inherits</I> variables and 
methods from its <i class=emphasis>superclass</I> and uses them as 
if they're declared within the subclass itself: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Animal { 
    float weight; 
    ... 
    void eat() { 
        ... 
    } 
    ... 
} 
 
class Mammal extends Animal { 
    int heartRate; 
    // inherits weight 
    ... 
    void breathe() { 
        ... 
    } 
    // inherits eat() 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In the above example, an object of type <tt class=literal>Mammal</tt> has
both the instance variable <tt class=literal>weight</tt> and the method
<tt class=literal>eat()</tt>. They are inherited from
<tt class=literal>Animal</tt>.

<p class=para>
A class can extend only one other class. To use the proper
terminology, Java allows <i class=emphasis>single inheritance</I> of
class implementation. Later we'll talk about interfaces, which
take the place of <i class=emphasis>multiple inheritance</I> as it's
primarily used in C++.

<p class=para>
A subclass can, of course, be further subclassed. Normally,
subclassing specializes or refines a class by adding
variables and methods:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Cat extends Mammal { 
    boolean longHair; 
    // inherits weight and heartRate 
    ... 
    void purr() { 
        ... 
    } 
    // inherits eat() and breathe()  
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> class is a type of
<tt class=literal>Mammal</tt> that is ultimately a type of
<tt class=literal>Animal</tt>. <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> objects inherit all
the characteristics of <tt class=literal>Mammal</tt> objects and, in turn,
<tt class=literal>Animal</tt> objects. <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> also
provides additional behavior in the form of the
<tt class=literal>purr()</tt> method and the <tt class=literal>longHair</tt>
variable. We can denote the class relationship in a diagram, as shown
in <a href="#EXJ-CH-5-FIG-3">Figure 5.3</A>.

<div class=figure>

<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0503.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-3]" width=503 height=173 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
A subclass inherits all members of its superclass not designated 
as <tt class=literal>private</tt>. As we'll discuss shortly, other 
levels of visibility affect what inherited members of the class can be 
seen from outside of the class and its subclasses, but at a minimum, a 
subclass always has the same set of visible members as its parent. For 
this reason, the type of a subclass can be considered a subtype of its 
parent, and instances of the subtype can be used 
anywhere instances 
of the supertype are allowed. For example: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Cat simon = new Cat(); 
Animal creature = simon; 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> <tt class=literal>simon</tt> in the 
above example can be assigned to the <tt class=literal>Animal</tt> type 
variable <tt class=literal>creature</tt> because <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> 
is a subtype of <tt class=literal>Animal</tt>. 

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5.1">Shadowed Variables</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.SHAD1"></A><a name="CH05.SHAD2"></A>In the previous section on methods, we saw that a local variable of the 
same name as an instance variable hides the instance variable. Similarly, 
an instance variable in a subclass can shadow an instance variable of 
the same name in its parent class, as shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-5-FIG-4">Figure 5.4</A>. 

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-FIG-4">Figure 5.4: The scope of shadowed variables</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0504.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-4]" width=503 height=243 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
In <a href="#EXJ-CH-5-FIG-4">Figure 5.4</A>, the variable
<tt class=literal>weight</tt> is declared in three places: as a local
variable in the method <tt class=literal>foodConsumption()</tt> of the
class <tt class=literal>Mammal</tt>, as an instance variable of the class
<tt class=literal>Mammal</tt>, and as an instance variable of the class
<tt class=literal>Animal</tt>. The actual variable selected depends on the
scope in which we are working.

<p class=para>
In the above example, all variables were of the same type. About 
the only reason for declaring a variable with the same type in a subclass 
is to provide an alternate initializer. A more important use of shadowed 
variables involves changing their types. We could, for example, shadow 
an <tt class=literal>int</tt> variable with a <tt class=literal>double</tt> 
variable in a subclass that needs decimal values instead 
of integer values. We do this without changing the existing code because, 
as its name suggests, when we shadow variables, we don't replace them 
but instead mask them. Both variables still exist; methods of the 
superclass see the original variable, and methods of the subclass see the 
new version. The determination of what variables the various methods see 
is static and happens at compile-time. 

<p class=para>
Here's a simple example: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class IntegerCalculator { 
    int sum; 
    ... 
} 
 
class DecimalCalculator extends IntegerCalculator { 
    double sum; 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In this example, we override the instance variable
<tt class=literal>sum</tt> to change its type from <tt class=literal>int</tt>
to <tt class=literal>double</tt>.[3]
 Methods
defined in the class <tt class=literal>IntegerCalculator</tt> see the
integer variable <tt class=literal>sum</tt>, while methods defined in
<tt class=literal>DecimalCalculator</tt> see the decimal variable
<tt class=literal>sum</tt>. However, both variables actually exist for a
given instance of <tt class=literal>DecimalCalculator</tt>, and they can
have independent values. In fact, any methods that
<tt class=literal>DecimalCalculator</tt> inherits from
<tt class=literal>IntegerCalculator</tt> actually see the integer variable
<tt class=literal>sum</tt>.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[3] 
Note that a better way to design our calculators would be to have an
abstract <tt class=literal>Calculator</tt> class with two subclasses:
<tt class=literal>IntegerCalculator</tt> and
<tt class=literal>DecimalCalculator</tt>.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Since both variables exist in
<tt class=literal>DecimalCalculator</tt>, we need to reference
the variable inherited from <tt class=literal>IntegerCalculator</tt>. We
do that using the <tt class=literal>super</tt> reference:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
int s = super.sum 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Inside of <tt class=literal>DecimalCalculator</tt>, the <tt class=literal>super</tt> 
keyword used in this manner refers to the <tt class=literal>sum</tt> 
variable defined in the superclass. I'll explain the use of <tt class=literal>super</tt> 
more fully in a bit. 

<p class=para>
Another important point about shadowed variables has to do with how they 
work when we refer to an object by way of a less derived type. For example, 
we can refer to a <tt class=literal>DecimalCalculator</tt> object as 
an <tt class=literal>IntegerCalculator</tt>. If we do so and then access 
the variable <tt class=literal>sum</tt>, we get the integer variable, 
not the decimal one: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
DecimalCalculator dc = new DecimalCalculator(); 
IntegerCalculator ic = dc; 
 
int s = ic.sum;                  // Accesses IntegerCalculator sum 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
After this detailed explanation, you may still be wondering what
shadowed variables are good for. Well, to be honest, the usefulness of
shadowed variables is limited, but it's important to understand the
concepts before we talk about doing the same thing with
methods. We'll see a different and more dynamic type
of behavior with method shadowing, or more correctly,
<i class=emphasis>method overriding</I>.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5.2">Overriding Methods</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.OVERR1"></A><a name="CH05.OVERR2"></A>In a previous section, we saw we could declare overloaded methods
(i.e., methods with the same name but a different number or type of
arguments) within a class. Overloaded method selection works the way I
described on all methods available to a class, including
inherited ones. This means that a subclass can define some overloaded
methods that augment the overloaded methods provided by a superclass.

<p class=para>
But a subclass does more than that; it can define a method
that has exactly the <i class=emphasis>same</I> method signature
(arguments and return type) as a method in its superclass. In that
case, the method in the subclass <i class=emphasis>overrides</I> the
method in the superclass and effectively replaces its implementation,
as shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-5-FIG-5">Figure 5.5</A>. Overriding methods to
change the behavior of objects is another form of
polymorphism (sub-type polymorphism): the one most people think of when they 
talk about the power of object-oriented languages.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-FIG-5">Figure 5.5: Method overriding</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0505.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-5]" width=503 height=232 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
In <a href="#EXJ-CH-5-FIG-5">Figure 5.5</A>, <tt class=literal>Mammal</tt>
overrides the <tt class=literal>reproduce()</tt> method of
<tt class=literal>Animal</tt>, perhaps to specialize the method for the
peculiar behavior of <tt class=literal>Mammals</tt> giving live
birth.[4]
 The <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> object's
sleeping behavior is overridden to be different from that of a general
<tt class=literal>Animal</tt>, perhaps to accommodate cat naps. The
<tt class=literal>Cat</tt> class also adds the more unique behaviors of
purring and hunting mice.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[4] 
We'll ignore the platypus, which is an obscure nonovoviviparous
mammal.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
From what you've seen so far, overridden methods probably
look like they shadow methods in superclasses, just as variables
do. But overridden methods are actually more powerful than that. An
overridden method in Java acts like a <tt class=literal>virtual</tt>
method in C++. When there are multiple implementations of a method in
the inheritance hierarchy of an object, the one in the most derived
class always overrides the others, even if we refer to
the object by way of a less derived type. In other words, if we have a
<tt class=literal>Cat</tt> instance assigned to a variable of the more
general type <tt class=literal>Animal</tt> and we call its
<tt class=literal>sleep()</tt> method, we get the
<tt class=literal>sleep()</tt> method implemented in the
<tt class=literal>Cat</tt> class, not the one in
<tt class=literal>Animal</tt>:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Cat simon = new Cat(); 
Animal creature = simon; 
 
creature.sleep();          // Accesses Cat sleep(); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In other respects, the variable <tt class=literal>creature</tt> looks
like an <tt class=literal>Animal</tt>. For example, access to a shadowed
variable would find the implementation in the
<tt class=literal>Animal</tt> class, not the <tt class=literal>Cat</tt>
class. However, because methods are virtual, the appropriate method in
the <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> class can be located, even though we are
dealing with an <tt class=literal>Animal</tt> object. This means we
can deal with specialized objects as if they were more general types
of objects and still take advantage of their specialized
implementations of behavior.

<p class=para>
Much of what you'll be doing when you're writing a
Java applet or application is overriding methods defined by
various classes in the Java API. For example, think
back to the applets we developed in the tutorial in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>A First Applet</i></A>. Almost all of the methods we implemented for
those applets were overridden methods. Recall that we created a
subclass of <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> for each of the examples. Then
we overrode various methods: <tt class=literal>init()</tt> set up our
applet, <tt class=literal>mouseDrag()</tt>
to handle mouse movement, and <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> to draw our
applet.

<p class=para>
A common programming error in Java (at least for me) is to miss
and accidentally overload a method when trying to override it. Any
difference in the number or type of arguments or the return type of a
method produces two overloaded methods instead of a single, overridden
method. Make it a habit to look twice when overriding methods.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5.2.1">Overridden methods and dynamic binding</A></h4>

<p class=para>
In a previous section, I mentioned that overloaded methods are
selected by the compiler at compile-time. Overridden methods, on the
other hand, are selected dynamically at run-time. Even if we create an 
instance of a subclass our code has never seen before (perhaps a new object 
type loaded from the network), any overridden methods that it contains will 
be located and invoked at run-time to replace those that existed when we 
last compiled our code.

<p class=para>
In contrast, if we load a new class that implements an
additional, more specific overloaded method, our code will continue to
use the implementation it discovered at compile-time. Another
effect of this is that casting (i.e., explicitly telling the compiler
to treat an object as one of its assignable types) affects the selection
of overloaded methods, but not overridden methods.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5.2.3">Static method binding</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Static methods do not belong to any object instance, they are accessed directly
through a class name, so they are not dynamically selected at run-time like
instance methods.  That is why static methods are called "static"--they are
always bound at compile time.  

<p class=para>
A <tt class=literal>static</tt> method in a superclass can be shadowed
by another <tt class=literal>static</tt> method in a subclass, as long as
the original method was not declared <tt class=literal>final</tt>.
However, you can't override a <tt class=literal>static</tt> method with
a non<tt class=literal>static</tt> method. In other words, you can't
change a <tt class=literal>static</tt> method into an instance method
in a subclass.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch05-SECT3-AUTOID.2">Dynamic method selection and peformance</A></h4>

<p class=para>
When Java has to dynamically search for overridden methods in
subclasses, there's a small performance penalty. In languages like
C++, the default is for methods to act like shadowed variables, so you
have to explicitly declare the methods you want to be virtual.  Java
is more dynamic, and the default is for all instance methods to be
virtual.  In Java you can, however, go the other direction and
explicitly declare that an instance method can't be overridden, so
that it will not be subject to dynamic binding and will not suffer in
terms of performance.
This is done with the <tt class=literal>final</tt> modifier. We have seen
<tt class=literal>final</tt> used with variables to effectively make them
constants. When <tt class=literal>final</tt> is applied to a method, it
means that that method can't be overridden (in some sense, its
implementation is constant). <tt class=literal>final</tt> can also be
applied to an entire class, which means the class can't be subclassed.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch05-SECT3-AUTOID.3">Compiler optimiziations</A></h4>

<p class=para>
When <i class=command>javac</i>, the Java compiler, is run with the 
<tt class=literal>-O</tt> switch, it performs certain optimizations. 
It can inline <tt class=literal>final</tt> methods to improve 
performance (while slightly increasing the size of the resulting class file). 
<tt class=literal>private</tt> methods, which are effectively
<tt class=literal>final</tt>, can also be inlined, and
<tt class=literal>final</tt> classes may also benefit from more 
powerful optimizations.

<p class=para>

Another kind of optimization allows you to include debugging code 
in your Java source without penalty.  Java doesn't have a pre-processor, 
to explicitly control what source is included, but you can get some of the 
same effects by making a block of code conditional on a constant (i.e.,
<tt class=literal>static</tt> and <tt class=literal>final</tt>) 
variable. 
The Java compiler is smart enough to remove this code when it 
determines that it won't be called.  For example:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
static final boolean DEBUG = false;
...
static void debug (String message) { 
    if (DEBUG) {
        System.err.println(message); 
        // do other stuff
        ...
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
 
If we compile the above code using the -O switch, the compiler will recognize
that the condition on the DEBUG variable is always false, and the body of 
the debug() method will be optimized away.  But that's not all--since 
debug() itself is also final it can be inlined, and an empty inlined method
generates no code at all.  So, when we compile with DEBUG set to false, 
calls to the debug() method will generate no residual code at all.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5.2.2">Method selection revisited</A></h4>

<p class=para>
By now you should have a good, intuitive idea as to how methods are selected 
from the pool of potentially overloaded and overridden method names 
of a class. If, however, you are dying for a dry definition, I'll 
provide one now. If you are satisfied with your understanding, you may 
wish to skip this little exercise in logic. 

<p class=para>
In a previous section, I offered an inductive rule for
overloaded method resolution. It said that a method is considered more
specific than another if its arguments are polymorphically
assignable to the arguments of the second method. We can now expand
this rule to include the resolution of overridden methods by adding
the following condition: to be more specific than another method, the
type of the class containing the method must also be assignable to the
type of the class holding the second method.

<p class=para>
What does that mean? Well, the only classes whose types are
assignable are classes in the same inheritance hierarchy. So, what
we're talking about now is the set of all methods of the same name in
a class or any of its parent or child classes. Since subclass types
are assignable to superclass types, but not vice versa, the resolution
is pushed, in the way that we expect, down the chain, towards the
subclasses. This effectively adds a second dimension to the search,
in which resolution is pushed down the inheritance tree towards more
refined classes and, simultaneously, towards the most specific
overloaded method within a given class.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5.2.4">Exceptions and overridden methods</A></h4>

<p class=para>
When we talked about exception handling in <a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, <i>The Java Language</i></A>,
there's one thing I didn't mention because it
wouldn't have made sense then. An important restriction on
overridden methods is that they must adhere to the
<tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause of the parent method's
signature.  If an overridden method throws an exception, the exception must 
be of the type specified by the parent or a subtype of that exception.
Because the exception can be a subtype of the one specified by the parent,
the overridden method can refine the type of exception thrown to go along
with its new behavior.  For example:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
// A more refined exception 
class MeatInedibleException extends InedibleException { ...
}
        
class Animal {
    void eat( Food f ) throws InedibleException { ...
}
class Herbivore extends Animal {
    void eat( Food f ) throws InedibleException { 
        if ( f instanceof Meat )
            throw new MeatInedibleException();
        ....
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In the example above, Animal specifies that it can throw an
InedibleException from its eat() method.  Herbivore is a subclass
Animal, so it must be able to do this too.  However, Herbivore's eat()
method actually throws a more specific exception:
MeatInedibleException.  It can do this because MeatInedibleException
is a subtype of InedibleException (remember that Exceptions are
classes too).  Our calling code's <i class=command>catch</i> clause
can therefore be more specific:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Animal creature = ...
try {
    creature.eat( food );
} catch ( MeatInedibleException ) {
    // creature can't eat this food because it's meat
} catch ( InedibleException ) {
    // creature can't eat this food
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5.3"><i class=emphasis>this</I> and <i class=emphasis>super</I></A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.THIS1"></A><a name="CH05.THIS2"></A>The special references <tt class=literal>this</tt> and
<tt class=literal>super</tt> allow you to refer to the members of the
current object instance or those of the superclass, respectively.  We
have seen <tt class=literal>this</tt> used elsewhere to pass a reference
to the current object and to refer to shadowed instance variables.
The reference <tt class=literal>super</tt> does the same for the parents
of a class.  You can use it to refer to members of a superclass that
have been shadowed or overridden.  A common arrangement is for an
overridden method in a subclass to do some preliminary work and then
defer to the method of the superclass to finish the job.

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Animal { 
    void eat( Food f ) throws InedibleException { 
        // consume food
    }
} 
 
class Herbivore extends Animal { 
    void eat( Food f ) throws InedibleException { 
        // check if edible
        ...
        super.eat( f ); 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In the above example, our <tt class=literal>Herbivore</tt> class overrides 
the <tt class=literal>Animal</tt> <tt class=literal>eat()</tt> method 
to first do some checking on the food object.
After doing its job it simply calls the (otherwise overridden) implementation
of eat() in its superclass, using <tt class=literal>super</tt>. 

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>super</tt> prompts a search for the method or
variable to begin in the scope of the immediate superclass rather than the 
current class.  The inherited method or variable found may reside in the 
immediate superclass, or in a more distant one.  
The usage of the <tt class=literal>super</tt>
reference when applied to overridden methods of a superclass is
special; it tells the method resolution system to stop the dynamic method 
search at the superclass, instead of in the most derived class (as it 
otherwise does).  Without <tt class=literal>super</tt>, there would be no 
way to access overridden methods.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5.4">Casting</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.CAST"></A><a name="CH05.CAST2"></A><a name="CH05.CAST3"></A>As in C++, a <i class=emphasis>cast</I> explicitly tells the compiler
to change the apparent type of an object reference. Unlike in C++,
casts in Java are checked both at compile- and at run-time to make
sure they are legal. Attempting to cast an object to an incompatible
type at run-time results in a
<tt class=literal>ClassCastException</tt>. Only casts between objects in
the same inheritance hierarchy (and as we'll see later, to
appropriate interfaces) are legal in Java and pass the scrutiny of the
compiler and the run-time system.

<p class=para>
Casts in Java affect only the treatment of references; they never change 
the form of the actual object. This is an important rule to keep in mind. 
You never change the object pointed to by a reference by casting it; you 
change only the compiler's (or run-time system's) notion of 
it. 

<p class=para>
A cast can be used to <i class=emphasis>narrow</I> the type of a 
reference--to make it more specific. Often, we'll do this when we have to 
retrieve an object 
from a more general type of collection or when it has been previously used 
as a less derived type. (The prototypical example is using an object in 
a <tt class=literal>Vector</tt> or <tt class=literal>Hashtable</tt>, 
as you'll see in <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, <i>Basic Utility Classes</i></A>.) Continuing with our <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> 
example: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Animal creature = ...
Cat simon = ...
 
creature = simon;        // Okay
// simon = creature;     // Compile time error, incompatible type 
simon = (Cat)creature;   // Okay 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
We can't reassign the reference in <tt class=literal>creature</tt> to the
variable <tt class=literal>simon</tt> even though we know it holds an
instance of a <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> (Simon). 
We have to perform the indicated cast. 
This is also called <i class=emphasis>downcasting</I> the reference.

<p class=para>
Note that an implicit cast was performed when we went the other way to 
<i class=emphasis>widen</I> the reference <tt class=literal>simon</tt> 
to type <tt class=literal>Animal</tt> during the first assignment. In this 
case, an explicit cast would have been legal, but superfluous. 

<p class=para>
If casting seems complicated, here's a simple way to
think about it. Basically, you can't lie about what an object is. If
you have a <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> object, you can cast it to a less
derived type (i.e., a type above it in the class hierarchy) such as
<tt class=literal>Animal</tt> or even <tt class=literal>Object</tt>, since all
Java classes are a subclass of <tt class=literal>Object</tt>. If you have
an <tt class=literal>Object</tt> you know is a
<tt class=literal>Cat</tt>, you can downcast the <tt class=literal>Object</tt>
to be an <tt class=literal>Animal</tt> or a
<tt class=literal>Cat</tt>. However, if you aren't sure if the
<tt class=literal>Object</tt> is a <tt class=literal>Cat</tt> or a
<tt class=literal>Dog</tt> at run-time, you should check it with
<tt class=literal>instanceof</tt> before you perform the cast. If you get
the cast wrong, Java throws a <tt class=literal>ClassCastException</tt>.

<p class=para>
As I mentioned earlier, casting can affect the selection of
compile-time items like variables and overloaded methods, but not the
selection of overridden methods. <a href="#EXJ-CH-5-FIG-6">Figure 5.6</A> shows
the difference. As shown in the top half of the diagram,
casting the reference <tt class=literal>simon</tt> to type
<tt class=literal>Animal</tt> (widening it) affects the selection of
the shadowed variable <tt class=literal>weight</tt> within it. However, as
the lower half of the diagram indicates, the cast doesn't affect the
selection of the overridden method <tt class=literal>sleep()</tt>.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5.5">Using superclass constructors</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.SUPER"></A><a name="CH05.CONSTRUCTORS"></A>When we talked earlier about constructors, we discussed how the
special statement <tt class=literal>this()</tt> invokes an
overloaded constructor upon entry to another constructor. Similarly,
the statement <tt class=literal>super()</tt> explicitly
invokes the constructor of a superclass. Of course, we also talked
about how Java makes a chain of constructor calls that includes the
superclass's constructor, so why use
<tt class=literal>super()</tt> explicitly?  When Java makes an implicit
call to the superclass constructor, it calls the default
constructor. So, if we 
want to invoke a superclass constructor that
takes arguments, we have to do so explicitly using
<tt class=literal>super()</tt>.

<p class=para>
If we are going to call a superclass constructor with
<tt class=literal>super()</tt>, it must be the first statement of our
constructor, just as <tt class=literal>this()</tt> must be the first call
we make in an overloaded constructor. Here's a simple example:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Person { 
    Person ( String name ) { 
        //  setup based on name 
        ... 
    } 
    ... 
} 
 
class Doctor extends Person { 
    Doctor ( String name, String specialty ) { 
        super( name ); 
        // setup based on specialty 
        ... 
    } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In this example, we use <tt class=literal>super()</tt> to take
advantage of the implementation of the superclass constructor and
avoid duplicating the code to set up the object based on its name. In
fact, because the class <tt class=literal>Person</tt> doesn't define a
default (no arguments) constructor, we have no choice but to call
<tt class=literal>super()</tt> explicitly. Otherwise, the compiler would
complain that it couldn't find an appropriate default constructor to
call. Said another way, if you subclass a class that has only
constructors that take arguments, you have to invoke one of the
superclass's constructors explicitly from your subclass
constructor.

<p class=para>
Instance variables of the class are initialized upon return
from the superclass constructor, whether that's due to an explicit
call via <tt class=literal>super()</tt> or an implicit call to the default
superclass constructor.

<p class=para>
We can now give the full story of how constructors are chained together 
and when instance variable initialization occurs. The rule has three parts 
and is applied repeatedly for each successive constructor invoked. 

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>If the first statement of a constructor is an ordinary 
statement--i.e., not a call to <tt class=literal>this()</tt> or
<tt class=literal>super()</tt>--Java inserts an implicit call to
<tt class=literal>super()</tt> to invoke the default constructor of the
superclass. Upon returning from that call, Java initializes the
instance variables of the current class and proceeds to execute
the statements of the current constructor.

<p>
<li class=listitem>If the first statement of a constructor is a call to a superclass
constructor via <tt class=literal>super()</tt>, Java invokes the selected
superclass constructor. Upon its return, Java initializes the current
class's instance variables and proceeds with the statements
of the current constructor.

<p>
<li class=listitem>If the first statement of a constructor is a call to an overloaded
constructor via <tt class=literal>this()</tt>, Java invokes the selected
constructor and upon its return simply proceeds with the statements of
the current constructor. The call to the superclass's constructor
has happened within the overloaded constructor, either explicitly or
implicitly, so the initialization of instance variables has already
occurred.

<p>
</UL>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-5.6">Abstract Methods and Classes</A></h3>

<p class=para>
As in C++, a method can be declared with the
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt> modifier to indicate that it's just a
prototype.  An abstract method has no body; it's simply a signature 
definition followed by a semicolon. You can't directly use a class that
contains an abstract method; you must instead create a subclass that
implements the abstract method's body.

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
abstract vaporMethod( String name ); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In Java, a class that contains one or more abstract
methods must be explicitly declared as an abstract
class, also using the <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> modifier&nbsp;:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
abstract class vaporClass { 
    ... 
    abstract vaporMethod( String name ); 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
An abstract class can contain other,
nonabstract methods and ordinary variable
declarations; however, it can't be instantiated. To be used, it must
be subclassed and its abstract methods must be
overridden with methods that implement a body. Not all
abstract methods have to be implemented in a single
subclass, but a subclass that doesn't override all its
superclass's abstract methods with actual,
concrete implementations must also be declared
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt>.

<p class=para>
Abstract classes provide a framework for classes that are to be "filled in"
by the implementor.  
The <tt class=literal>java.io.InputStream</tt> class, for example, has a
single abstract method called
<tt class=literal>read()</tt>. Various subclasses of
<tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> implement <tt class=literal>read()</tt> in
their own ways to read from their own sources. The rest of the
<tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> class, however, provides extended
functionality built on the simple <tt class=literal>read()</tt>
method. A subclass of <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> inherits
these nonabstract methods that provide
functionality based on the simple <tt class=literal>read()</tt> method
that the subclass implements.

<p class=para>
It's often desirable to specify only the prototypes for a
whole set of methods and provide no implementation. In C++,
this would be a purely abstract class. In Java, you
should instead use an <i class=emphasis>interface</I>. An interface is
like a purely abstract class; it defines a set of
methods a class must implement (i.e., the behavior of a
class). However, unlike in C++, a class in Java can simply say that it
<tt class=literal>implements</tt> an interface and go about implementing
those methods. As we'll discuss later, a class that implements
an interface doesn't have to inherit from any particular part of
the inheritance hierarchy or use a particular implementation.
