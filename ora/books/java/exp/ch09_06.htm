<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-9-SECT-6">9.6 Writing a Protocol Handler</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH09.WEB3A"></A>A <tt class=literal>URL</tt> object uses a protocol handler to establish a
connection with a server and perform whatever protocol is necessary to
retrieve data. For example, an HTTP protocol
handler knows how to talk to an HTTP server and
retrieve a document; an FTP protocol handler knows
how to talk to an FTP server and retrieve a
file. All types of URLs use protocol handlers to
access their objects. Even the lowly "file" type
URLs use a special "file" protocol handler that
retrieves files from the local filesystem. The data a protocol
handler retrieves is then fed to an appropriate content handler for
interpretation.

<p class=para>
<a name="CH09.USH"></A>While we refer to a protocol handler as a single entity, it
really has two parts: a <tt class=literal>java.net.URLStreamHandler</tt>
and a <tt class=literal>java.net.URLConnection</tt>. These are both
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt> classes we will subclass to create
our protocol handler. (Note that these are <tt class=literal>abstract</tt>
classes, not interfaces. Although they contain abstract methods we are required to implement,
they also contain many utility methods we can use or override.)
The <tt class=literal>URL</tt> looks up an appropriate
<tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt>, based on the protocol component
of the <tt class=literal>URL</tt>. The <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt>
then finishes parsing the URL and creates a
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> when it's time to communicate with
the server. The <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> represents a single
connection with a server, and implements the communication protocol
itself.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-9-SECT-6.1">Locating Protocol Handlers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Protocol handlers are organized in a package hierarchy similar to
content handlers. Unlike content handlers, which are grouped into
packages by the MIME types of the objects that they
handle, protocol handlers are given individual packages. Both parts of
the protocol handler (the <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> class
and the <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> class) are located in a
package named for the protocol they support.

<p class=para>
For example, the classes for an FTP protocol
handler would be found in the <tt class=literal>net.www.protocol.ftp</tt>
package. The <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> is placed in this
package and given the name <tt class=literal>Handler</tt>; all
<tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt>s are named
<tt class=literal>Handler</tt> and distinguished by the package in which
they reside. The <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> portion of the
protocol handler is placed in the same package, and can be given any
name. There is no need for a naming convention because the
corresponding <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> is responsible for
creating the <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> objects it uses. <a href="#EXJ-CH-9-TAB-2">Table 9.2</A> gives the obvious examples.[9]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[9] 
The "pre-beta 1" release of HotJava has a temporary solution that is
compatible with the convention described here. In the HotJava
<i class=filename>properties</i> file, add the line: 
<tt class=literal>java.protocol.handler.pkgs=net.www.protocol</tt>.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-9-SECT-6.2">URLs, Stream Handlers, and Connections</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>URL</tt>, <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt>,
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>, and <tt class=literal>ContentHandler</tt>
classes work together closely. Before diving into an example,
let's take a step back, look at the parts a little more closely,
and see how these things communicate. <a href="#EXJ-CH-9-FIG-5">Figure 9.5</A>
shows how these components relate to each other.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-9-FIG-5">Figure 9.5: The protocol handler machinery</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0905.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 9-5]" width=503 height=193 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
We begin with the <tt class=literal>URL</tt> object, which points
to the resource we'd like to retrieve. The
<tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> helps the <tt class=literal>URL</tt>
class parse the URL specification string for its
particular protocol. For example, consider the following call to the
<tt class=literal>URL</tt> constructor:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
URL url = new URL("protocol://foo.bar.com/file.ext"); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>URL</tt> class parses only the protocol component;
later, a call to the <tt class=literal>URL</tt> class's
<tt class=literal>getContent()</tt> or <tt class=literal>openStream()</tt>
method starts the machinery in motion. The <tt class=literal>URL</tt>
class locates the appropriate protocol handler by looking in the
protocol-package hierarchy. It then creates an instance of the
appropriate <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> class.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> is responsible for
parsing the rest of the URL string, including
hostname and filename, and possibly an alternative port
designation. This allows different protocols to have their own
variations on the format of the URL specification
string. Note that this step is skipped when a URL
is constructed with the "protocol," "host," and "file"
components specified explicitly. If the protocol is straightforward,
its <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> class can let Java do the
parsing and accept the default behavior. For this illustration,
we'll assume that the <tt class=literal>URL</tt> string requires no
special parsing. (If we use a nonstandard
URL with a strange format, we're responsible
for parsing it ourselves, as I'll show shortly.)

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>URL</tt> object next invokes the
handler's <tt class=literal>openConnection()</tt> method, prompting
the handler to create a new <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> to the
resource. The <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> performs whatever
communications are necessary to talk to the resource and begins to
fetch data for the object. At that time, it also determines the
MIME type of the incoming object data and prepares
an <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> to hand to the appropriate content
handler. This <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> must send
"pure" data with all traces of the protocol removed.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> also locates an
appropriate content handler in the content-handler package
hierarchy. The <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> creates an instance of
a content handler; to put the content handler to work, the
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>getContent()</tt> method calls the content
handler's <tt class=literal>getContent()</tt> method. If this sounds
confusing, it is: we have three <tt class=literal>getContent()</tt> methods
calling each other in a chain. The newly created
<tt class=literal>ContentHandler</tt> object then acquires the stream of
incoming data for the object by calling the
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>getInputStream()</tt> method. (Recall that we acquired
an <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> in our <tt class=literal>x_tar</tt>
content handler.) The content handler reads the stream and constructs
an object from the data. This object is then returned up the
<tt class=literal>getContent()</tt> chain: from the content handler, the
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>, and finally the
<tt class=literal>URL</tt> itself. Now our application has the desired
object in its greedy little hands.

<p class=para>
To summarize, we create a protocol handler by implementing a
<tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> class that creates specialized
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> objects to handle our protocol. The
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> objects implement the
<tt class=literal>getInputStream()</tt> method, which provides data to a
content handler for construction of an object. The base
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> class implements many of the methods
we need; therefore, our <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> needs only to
provide the methods that generate the data stream and return the
MIME type of the object data.

<p class=para>
Okay. If you're not thoroughly confused by all that
terminology (or even if you are), let's move on to the
example. It should help to pin down what all these classes are
doing.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-9-SECT-6.3">The crypt Handler</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH09.CRYPT"></A>In this section, we'll build a <i class=emphasis>crypt</I> 
protocol handler. It parses URLs of the form: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
crypt:<tt class=replaceable><i>type</i></tt>//<tt class=replaceable><i>hostname</i></tt>[:<tt class=replaceable><i>port</i></tt>]/<tt class=replaceable><i>location</i></tt>/<tt class=replaceable><i>item</i></tt> 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=replaceable><i>type</i></tt> is an identifier that specifies what kind of
encryption to use. The protocol itself is a simplified version of
HTTP; we'll implement the
<tt class=literal>GET</tt> command and no more. I added the
<tt class=replaceable><i>type</i></tt> identifier to the URL to
show how to parse a nonstandard URL
specification. Once the handler has figured out the encryption type,
it dynamically loads a class that implements the chosen encryption
algorithm and uses it to retrieve the data. Obviously, we don't
have room to implement a full-blown public-key encryption algorithm,
so we'll use the <tt class=literal>rot13InputStream</tt> class from
<a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, <i>Input/Output Facilities</i></A>. It should be apparent how the example can
be extended by plugging in a more powerful encryption class.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-9-SECT-6.3.1">The Encryption class</A></h4>

<p class=para>
First, we'll lay out our plug-in encryption class. We'll
define an abstract class called
<tt class=literal>CryptInputStream</tt> that provides some essentials for
our plug-in encrypted protocol. From the
<tt class=literal>CryptInputStream</tt> we'll create a
subclass, <tt class=literal>rot13CryptInputStream</tt>, that implements
our particular kind of encryption:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
package net.www.protocol.crypt; 
import java.io.*; 
 
abstract class CryptInputStream extends InputStream { 
    InputStream in; 
    OutputStream talkBack; 
    abstract public void set( InputStream in, OutputStream talkBack ); 
} 
 
class rot13CryptInputStream extends CryptInputStream { 
 
    public void set( InputStream in, OutputStream talkBack ) { 
        this.in = new example.io.rot13InputStream( in ); 
    } 
    public int read() throws IOException {  
        if ( in == null ) 
            throw new IOException("No Stream"); 
 
        return in.read(); 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Our <tt class=literal>CryptInputStream</tt> class defines a method called
<tt class=literal>set()</tt> that passes in the
<tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> it's to translate. Our
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> calls <tt class=literal>set()</tt> after
creating an instance of the encryption class. We need a
<tt class=literal>set()</tt> method because we want to load the encryption
class dynamically, and we aren't allowed to pass arguments to
the constructor of a class when it's dynamically loaded. We ran into
this same restriction in our content handler. In the encryption class,
we also provide an <tt class=literal>OutputStream</tt>. A more complex
kind of encryption might use the <tt class=literal>OutputStream</tt> to
transfer public-key information. Needless to say,
<i class=emphasis>rot13</I> doesn't, so we'll ignore the
<tt class=literal>OutputStream</tt> here.

<p class=para>
The implementation of <tt class=literal>rot13CryptInputStream</tt>
is very simple. <tt class=literal>set()</tt> just takes the
<tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> it receives and wraps it with the
<tt class=literal>rot13InputStream</tt> filter we developed in <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, <i>Input/Output Facilities</i></A>. <tt class=literal>read()</tt> reads filtered data
from the <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt>, throwing an exception if
<tt class=literal>set()</tt> hasn't been called.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-9-SECT-6.3.2">The URLStreamHandler</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Next we'll build our <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> class.
The class name is <tt class=literal>Handler</tt>; it extends the
abstract <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt>
class. This is the class the Java <tt class=literal>URL</tt> looks up
by converting the protocol name (<i class=emphasis>crypt</I>) into a
package name (<tt class=literal>net.www.protocol.crypt</tt>). The
fully 
qualified name of this class is
<tt class=literal>net.www.protocol.crypt.Handler</tt>:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
package net.www.protocol.crypt; 
 
import java.io.*; 
import java.net.*; 
 
public class Handler extends URLStreamHandler { 
    String cryptype; 
 
    protected void parseURL(URL u, String spec, int start, int end) { 
        int slash = spec.indexOf('/'); 
        cryptype = spec.substring(start, slash); 
        start=slash; 
        super.parseURL(u, spec, start, end); 
    } 
 
    protected URLConnection openConnection(URL url) 
       throws IOException {
 
        return new CryptURLConnection( url, cryptype ); 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Java creates an instance of our <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt>
when we create a <tt class=literal>URL</tt> specifying the
<i class=emphasis>crypt</I> protocol. <tt class=literal>Handler</tt> has
two jobs: to assist in parsing the URL
specification strings and to create
<tt class=literal>CryptURLConnection</tt> objects when it's time to open a
connection to the host.

<p class=para>
Our <tt class=literal>parseURL()</tt> method overrides the
<tt class=literal>parseURL()</tt> method in the
<tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt> class. It's called whenever the
<tt class=literal>URL</tt> constructor sees a URL
requesting the <i class=emphasis>crypt</I> protocol. For example:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
URL url = new URL("crypt:rot13//foo.bar.com/file.txt"); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>parseURL()</tt> is passed a reference to the
<tt class=literal>URL</tt> object, the URL
specification string, and starting and ending indexes that shows what
portion of the URL string we're expected to
parse. The <tt class=literal>URL</tt> class has already identified the
protocol name, otherwise it wouldn't have found our protocol
handler. Our version of <tt class=literal>parseURL()</tt> retrieves our
<i class=emphasis>type</I> identifier from the specification, stores it
in the variable <tt class=literal>cryptype</tt>, and then passes the rest
on to the superclass's <tt class=literal>parseURL()</tt> method to
complete the job. To find the encryption type, take everything
between the starting index we were given and the first slash in the
URL string. Before calling
<tt class=literal>super.parseURL()</tt>, we update the start index, so
that it points to the character just after the type specifier. This
tells the superclass <tt class=literal>parseURL()</tt> that we've
already parsed everything prior to the first slash, and it's
responsible for the rest.

<p class=para>
Before going on, I'll note two other possibilities. If we
hadn't hacked the URL string for our own
purposes by adding a type specifier, we'd be dealing with a
standard URL specification. In this case, we
wouldn't need to override <tt class=literal>parseURL()</tt>; the
default implementation would have been sufficient. It could have
sliced the URL into host, port, and filename
components normally. On the other hand, if we had created a completely
bizarre URL format, we would need to parse
the entire string. There would be no point calling
<tt class=literal>super.parseURL()</tt>; instead, we'd have called the
<tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt>'s protected method
<tt class=literal>setURL()</tt> to pass the URL's
components back to the <tt class=literal>URL</tt> object.

<p class=para>
The other method in our <tt class=literal>Handler</tt> class is
<tt class=literal>openConnection()</tt>. After the URL
has been completely parsed, the <tt class=literal>URL</tt> object calls
<tt class=literal>openConnection()</tt> to set up the data
transfer. <tt class=literal>openConnection()</tt> calls the constructor
for our <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> with appropriate arguments.
In this case, our <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> object is named
<tt class=literal>CryptURLConnection</tt>, and the constructor requires the
<tt class=literal>URL</tt> and the encryption type as arguments.
<tt class=literal>parseURL()</tt> picked the encryption type from the
URL string and stored it in the
<tt class=literal>cryptype</tt> variable.
<tt class=literal>openConnection()</tt> returns a reference to our
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>, which the <tt class=literal>URL</tt>
object uses to drive the rest of the process.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-9-SECT-6.3.3">The URLConnection</A></h4>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH09.CONN"></A>Finally, we reach the real guts of our protocol handler, the
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> class. This is the class that opens
the socket, talks to the server on the remote host, and implements the
protocol itself. This class doesn't have to be public, so you
can put it in the same file as the <tt class=literal>Handler</tt> class we
just defined. We call our class <tt class=literal>Crypt-URLConnection</tt>;
it extends the abstract <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> class. Unlike
<tt class=literal>ContentHandler</tt> and
<tt class=literal>StreamURLConnection</tt>, whose names are defined by
convention, we can call this class anything we want; the only class
that needs to know about the <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> is the
<tt class=literal>URLStreamHandler</tt>, which we wrote ourselves.

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class CryptURLConnection extends URLConnection { 
    CryptInputStream cis; 
    static int defaultPort = 80; 
 
    CryptURLConnection ( URL url, String cryptype ) 
        throws IOException { 
        super( url ); 
        try { 
            String name = "net.www.protocol.crypt." + cryptype 
                               + "CryptInputStream"; 
            cis = (CryptInputStream)Class.forName(name).newInstance(); 
        } 
        catch ( Exception e ) { } 
    } 
 
    synchronized public void connect() throws IOException {  
        int port; 
        if ( cis == null ) 
            throw new IOException("Crypt Class Not Found"); 
        if ( (port = url.getPort()) == -1 ) 
            port = defaultPort; 
        Socket s = new Socket( url.getHost(), port ); 
 
        // Send the filename in plaintext 
        OutputStream server = s.getOutputStream(); 
        new PrintStream( server ).println( "GET "+url.getFile() ); 
 
        // Initialize the CryptInputStream 
        cis.set( s.getInputStream(), server ); 
        connected = true; 
    } 
 
    synchronized public InputStream getInputStream() 
       throws IOException { 
        if (!connected) 
            connect(); 
        return ( cis );  
    } 
 
    public String getContentType() { 
        return guessContentTypeFromName( url.getFile() ); 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The constructor for our <tt class=literal>CryptURLConnection</tt> class
takes as arguments the destination <tt class=literal>URL</tt> and the name
of an encryption type. We pass the <tt class=literal>URL</tt> on to the
constructor of our superclass, which saves it in a protected
<tt class=literal>url</tt> instance variable. We could have saved the
<tt class=literal>URL</tt> ourselves, but calling our parent's
constructor shields us from possible changes or enhancements to the
base class. We use <tt class=literal>cryptype</tt> to construct the name
of an encryption class, using the convention that the encryption class
is in the same package as the protocol handler (i.e.,
<tt class=literal>net.www.protocol.crypt</tt>); its name is the encryption
type followed by the suffix <tt class=literal>CryptInputStream</tt>.

<p class=para>
Once we have a name, we need to create an instance of the
encryption class. To do so, we use the static method
<tt class=literal>Class.forName()</tt> to turn the name into a
<tt class=literal>Class</tt> object and <tt class=literal>newInstance()</tt>
to load and instantiate the class. (This is how Java loads the content
and protocol handlers themselves.)  <tt class=literal>newInstance()</tt>
returns an <tt class=literal>Object</tt>; we need to cast it to something
more specific before we can work with it. Therefore, we cast it to our
<tt class=literal>CryptInputStream</tt> class, the abstract class that
<tt class=literal>rot13CryptInputStream</tt> extends. If we implement any
additional encryption types as extensions to
<tt class=literal>CryptInputStream</tt> and name them appropriately, they
will fit into our protocol handler without modification.

<p class=para>
We do the rest of our setup in the <tt class=literal>connect()</tt>
method of the <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>. There, we make sure
we have an encryption class and open a <tt class=literal>Socket</tt>
to the appropriate port on the remote
host. <tt class=literal>getPort()</tt> returns <tt class=literal>-1</tt> if the
<tt class=literal>URL</tt> doesn't specify a port explicitly; in
that case we use the default port for an HTTP
connection (port 80). We ask for an <tt class=literal>OutputStream</tt> on
the socket, assemble a <tt class=literal>GET</tt> command using the
<tt class=literal>getFile()</tt> method to discover the filename specified
by the URL, and send our request by writing it into
the <tt class=literal>OutputStream</tt>. (For convenience, we wrap the
<tt class=literal>OutputStream</tt> with a <tt class=literal>PrintStream</tt>
and call <tt class=literal>println()</tt> to send the message.) We then
initialize the <tt class=literal>CryptInputStream</tt> class by calling
its <tt class=literal>set()</tt> method and passing it an
<tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> from the <tt class=literal>Socket</tt> and
the <tt class=literal>OutputStream</tt>.

<p class=para>
The last thing <tt class=literal>connect()</tt> does is set the
<tt class=literal>boolean</tt> variable <tt class=literal>connected</tt> to
<tt class=literal>true</tt>. <tt class=literal>connected</tt> is a
<tt class=literal>protected</tt> variable inherited from the
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> class. We need to track the state of
our connection because <tt class=literal>connect()</tt> is a
<tt class=literal>public</tt> method. It's called by the
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>getInputStream()</tt> method, but it could also be
called by other classes. Since we don't want to start a
connection if one already exists, we use
<tt class=literal>connected</tt> to tell us if this is so.

<p class=para>
In a more sophisticated protocol handler,
<tt class=literal>connect()</tt> would also be responsible for dealing
with any protocol headers that come back from the server. In
particular, it would probably stash any important information it can
deduce from the headers (e.g., MIME type, content
length, time stamp) in instance variables, where it's available
to other methods. At a minimum, <tt class=literal>connect()</tt>
strips the headers from the data so the content handler won't see
them. I'm being lazy and assuming that we'll connect
to a minimal server, like the modified <tt class=literal>TinyHttpd</tt>
daemon I discuss below, which doesn't bother with any headers.

<p class=para>
The bulk of the work has been done; a few details remain. The
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>getContent()</tt> method needs to figure out which
content handler to invoke for this <tt class=literal>URL</tt>. In order to
compute the content handler's name,
<tt class=literal>getContent()</tt> needs to know the resource's
MIME type. To find out, it calls the
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>getContentType()</tt> method, which returns the
MIME type as a <tt class=literal>String</tt>. Our
protocol handler overrides <tt class=literal>getContentType()</tt>,
providing our own implementation.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> class provides a number of
tools to help determine the MIME type. It's
possible that the MIME type is conveyed explicitly
in a protocol header; in this case, a more sophisticated version of
<tt class=literal>connect()</tt> would have stored the
MIME type in a convenient location for us. 
Some servers don't bother to insert the appropriate headers, though,
so you can use the method
<tt class=literal>guessContentTypeFromName()</tt> to examine filename
extensions, like <i class=filename>.gif</i> or
<i class=filename>.html</i>, and map them to MIME
types. In the worst case, you can use
<tt class=literal>guessContentTypeFromStream()</tt> to intuit the
MIME type from the raw data. The Java developers
call this method "a disgusting hack" that shouldn't
be needed, but that is unfortunately necessary "in a world
where HTTP servers lie about content types and
extensions are often nonstandard." We'll take the easy way
out and use the <tt class=literal>guessContentTypeFromName()</tt> utility
of the <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> class to determine the
MIME type from the filename extension of the
URL we are retrieving.

<p class=para>
Once the <tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt> has found a content
handler, it calls the content handler's
<tt class=literal>getContent()</tt> method. The content handler then needs
to get an <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> from which to read the
data. To find an <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt>, it calls the
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>getInputStream()</tt>
method. <tt class=literal>getInputStream()</tt> returns an
<tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> from which its caller can read the data
after protocol processing is finished. It checks whether a connection
is already established; if not, it calls <tt class=literal>connect()</tt>
to make the connection. Then it returns a reference to our
<tt class=literal>CryptInputStream</tt>.

<p class=para>
A final note on getting the content type: if you read the
documentation, it's clear that the Java developers had some
ideas about how to find the content type. The
<tt class=literal>URLConnection</tt>'s default
<tt class=literal>getContentType()</tt> calls
<tt class=literal>getHeaderField()</tt>, which is presumably supposed to
extract the named field from the protocol headers (it would probably
spit back information <tt class=literal>connect()</tt> had stored in
protected variables). The problem is there's no way to
implement <tt class=literal>getHeaderField()</tt> if you don't know
the protocol, and since the Java developers were designing a general
mechanism for working with protocols, they couldn't make any
assumptions. Therefore, the default implementation of
<tt class=literal>getHeaderField()</tt> returns
<tt class=literal>null</tt>; you have to override it to make it do
anything interesting. Why wasn't it an
abstract method? I can only guess, but making
<tt class=literal>getHeaderField()</tt> abstract would
have forced everyone building a protocol handler to implement it,
whether or not they actually needed it.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-9-SECT-6.3.4">The application</A></h4>

<p class=para>
We're almost ready to try out a crypt
URL! We still need an application (a mini-browser,
if you will) to use our protocol handler, and a server to serve data
with our protocol. If HotJava were available, we wouldn't need
to write the application ourselves; in the meantime, writing this
application will teach us a little about how a Java-capable browser
works. Our application is similar to the application we wrote to test
the <tt class=literal>x_tar</tt> content handler.

<p class=para>
Because we're working in a standalone application, we have to
tell Java how to find our protocol-handler classes. Java relies on a
<tt class=literal>java.net.URLStreamHandlerFactory</tt> object to take a
protocol name and return an instance of the appropriate handler. The
<tt class=literal>URLStreamHandlerFactory</tt> is very similar to the
<tt class=literal>ContentHandlerFactory</tt> we saw earlier. We'll
provide a trivial implementation that knows only our particular
handler. Again, if we were using our protocol handler with HotJava,
this step would not be necessary; HotJava has its own stream-handler
factory that tells it where to find handlers. To get HotJava to read
files with our new protocol, we'd only have to put our protocol
handler in the right place. (Note too, that an applet running in
HotJava can use any of the methods in the <tt class=literal>URL</tt> class
and therefore can use the content- and protocol-handler mechanism;
applets would also rely on HotJava's stream-handler and
content-xhandler factories.)

<p class=para>
Here's our <tt class=literal>StreamHandlerFactory</tt> and sample 
application: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
import java.net.*; 
 
class OurURLStreamHandlerFactory implements URLStreamHandlerFactory { 
    public URLStreamHandler createURLStreamHandler(String protocol) { 
        if ( protocol.equalsIgnoreCase("crypt") ) 
            return new net.www.protocol.crypt.Handler(); 
        else 
            return null; 
    } 
} 
 
class CryptURLTest {  
    public static void main( String argv[] ) throws Exception { 
 
        URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory(
            new OurURLStreamHandlerFactory()); 
 
        URL url = new URL("crypt:rot13//foo.bar.com:1234/myfile.txt"); 
        System.out.println( url.getContent() ); 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>CryptURLTest</tt> class installs our factory and
reads a document via the new "crypt:rot13"
URL. (In the example, we have assumed that a
<i class=emphasis>rot13</I> server is running on port 1234 on the host
foo.bar.com.)  When the
<tt class=literal>CryptURLTest</tt> application calls the
<tt class=literal>URL</tt>'s <tt class=literal>getContent()</tt> method,
it automatically finds our protocol handler, which decodes the file.

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>OurURLStreamHandlerFactory</tt> is really quite
simple. It implements the <tt class=literal>URLStreamHandlerFactory</tt>
interface, which requires a single method called
<tt class=literal>createURLStreamHandler()</tt>. In our case, this method
checks whether the protocol's name is
<i class=emphasis>crypt</I>&nbsp;; if so, the method returns an
instance of our encryption protocol handler,
<tt class=literal>net.www.protocol.crypt.Handler</tt>. For any other
protocol name, it returns <tt class=literal>null</tt>. If we were writing
a browser and needed to implement a more general factory, we would
compute a class name from the protocol name, check to see if that
class exists, and return an instance of that class.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-9-SECT-6.3.5">The server</A></h4>

<p class=para>
We still need a <i class=emphasis>rot13</I> server. Since the
<i class=emphasis>crypt</I> protocol is nothing more than
HTTP with some encryption added, we can make a
<i class=emphasis>rot13</I> server by modifying one line of the
<tt class=literal>TinyHttpd</tt> server we developed earlier, so that it
spews its files in <i class=emphasis>rot13</I>. Just change the line
that reads the data from the file:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
f.read( data ); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
To instead read through a <tt class=literal>rot13InputStream</tt>: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
new example.io.rot13InputStream( f ).read( data ); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
I assume you placed the <tt class=literal>rot13InputStream</tt> 
example in a package called <tt class=literal>example.io</tt>, and that 
it's somewhere in your class path. Now recompile and run the server. It 
automatically encodes the files before sending them; our sample application 
decodes them on the other end. 

<p class=para>
I hope that this example and the rest of this chapter have
given you some food for thought. Content and protocol handlers are
among the most exciting ideas in Java. It's unfortunate that we have
to wait for future releases of HotJava and Netscape to take full
advantage of them. In the meantime, you can experiment and implement
your own applications.
