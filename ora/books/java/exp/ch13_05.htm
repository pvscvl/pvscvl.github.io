<p class=para>
Having learned to walk, let's try a jog. In this 
section, we'll look at some techniques for doing fast and flicker-free 
drawing and painting. If you're interested in animation or smooth 
updating, you should read on.[4]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[4] 
At this point, you still have to build your own animation software.
JavaSoft will be releasing an animation package as part of the Java
Media APIs.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Drawing operations take time, and time spent drawing leads to delays
and imperfect results. Our goal is to minimize the amount of drawing
work we do and, as much as possible, to do that work away from the
eyes of the user. You'll remember that our
<tt class=literal>TestPattern</tt> applet had a blinking problem. It
blinked because <tt class=literal>TestPattern</tt> performs several,
large, area-filling operations each time its
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method is called. On a very slow system,
you might even be able to see each shape being drawn in
succession. <tt class=literal>TestPattern</tt> could be easily fixed by
drawing into an off-screen buffer and then copying the completed
buffer to the display. To see how to eliminate flicker and blinking
problems, we'll look at an applet that needs even more help.

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>TerribleFlicker</tt> illustrates some of the
problems of updating a display. Like many animations, it has two
parts: a constant background and a changing object in the
foreground. In this case, the background is a checkerboard pattern and
the object is a small, scaled image we can drag around on top of
it, as shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-13-FIG-6">Figure 13.6</A>. Our first version of
<tt class=literal>TerribleFlicker</tt> lives up to its name and does a
very poor job of updating.

</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Try dragging the image; you'll notice both the background
and foreground flicker as they are repeatedly redrawn. What is
<tt class=literal>TerribleFlicker</tt> doing, and what is it doing wrong?

<p class=para>
As the mouse is dragged, <tt class=literal>TerribleFlicker</tt> keeps
track of its position in two instance variables,
<tt class=literal>currentX</tt> and <tt class=literal>currentY</tt>. On each
call to <tt class=literal>mouseDragged()</tt>, the coordinates are
updated, and <tt class=literal>repaint()</tt> is called to ask that the
display be updated. When <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> is called, it
looks at some parameters, draws the checkerboard pattern to fill the
applet's area, and finally paints a small version of the image at the
latest coordinates.

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.UP"></A>Our first, and biggest, problem is that we are updating,
but we have neglected to implement the applet's
<tt class=literal>update()</tt> method with a good strategy. Because we
haven't overridden <tt class=literal>update()</tt>, we are getting
the default implementation of the <tt class=literal>Component</tt>
<tt class=literal>update()</tt> method, which looks something like this:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
// Default implementation of applet update 
public void update( Graphics g ) { 
    setColor ( backgroundColor ); 
    fillRect( 0, 0, getSize().width, getSize().height ); 
    paint ( g ); 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This method simply clears the display to the background color and
calls our <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method. This is almost never the
best strategy, but is the only appropriate default for
<tt class=literal>update()</tt>, which doesn't know how much of the
screen we're really going to paint.

<p class=para>
Our applet paints its own background, in its entirety, so we can 
provide a simpler version of <tt class=literal>update()</tt> that doesn't
bother to clear the display:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
// add to TerribleFlicker
public void update( Graphics g ) { 
    paint( g ); 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This applet works better because we have eliminated one large,
unnecessary, and (in fact) annoying graphics operation. However,
although we have eliminated a <tt class=literal>fillRect()</tt> call,
we're still doing a lot of wasted drawing. Most of the background
stays the same each time it's drawn. You might think of trying to make
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> smarter, so that it wouldn't redraw
these areas, but remember that <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> has to be
able to draw the entire scene because it might be called in situations
when the display isn't intact. The solution is to have
<tt class=literal>update()</tt> help out by restricting the area
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> can draw.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-13-SECT-4.1">Clipping</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.CLIP1"></A>The <tt class=literal>setClip()</tt> method of the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> 
class restricts the drawing area of a graphics context to a smaller region. 
A graphics context normally has an effective clipping region that limits 
drawing to the entire display area of the component. We can specify a smaller 
clipping region with <tt class=literal>setClip()</tt>. 

<p class=para>
How is the drawing area restricted? Well, foremost, drawing
operations that fall outside of the clipping region are not
displayed. If a drawing operation overlaps the clipping region, we see
only the part that's inside. A second effect is that, in a good
implementation, the graphics context can recognize drawing operations
that fall completely outside the clipping region and ignore them
altogether. Eliminating unnecessary operations can save time if we're
doing something complex, like filling a bunch of polygons. This
doesn't save the time our application spends calling the drawing
methods, but the overhead of calling these kinds of drawing methods is
usually negligible compared to the time it takes to execute them. (If
we were generating an image pixel by pixel, this would not be the
case, as the calculations would be the major time sink, not the
drawing.)

<p class=para>
So we can save time in our applet by having our update method
set a clipping region that results in only the affected portion of the
display being redrawn. We can pick the smallest rectangular area that
includes both the old image position and the new image position, as
shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-13-FIG-7">Figure 13.7</A>. This is the only portion of
the display that really needs to change; everything else stays the
same.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-13-FIG-7">Figure 13.7: Determining the clipping region</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je1307.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 13-7]" width=503 height=223 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
An arbitrarily smart <tt class=literal>update()</tt> could save
even more time by redrawing only those regions that have
changed. However, the simple clipping strategy we've implemented
here can be applied to many kinds of drawing, and gives quite good
performance, particularly if the area being changed is small.

<p class=para>
One important thing to note is that, in addition to looking at
the new position, our updating operation now has to remember the last
position at which the image was drawn. Let's fix our applet so
it will use a clipping region. To keep this short and emphasize the
changes, we'll take some liberties with design and make our next
example a subclass of <tt class=literal>TerribleFlicker</tt>. Let's
call it <tt class=literal>ClippedFlicker</tt>:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public class ClippedFlicker extends TerribleFlicker { 
    int nextX, nextY;
    
    public void mouseDragged( MouseEvent e ) {
        nextX = e.getX(); nextY = e.getY();
        repaint();
    }
    void clipToAffectedArea( Graphics g, int oldx, int oldy, int newx, 
                                        int newy, int width, int height) {
        int x = Math.min( oldx, newx );
        int y = Math.min( oldy, newy );
        int w = ( Math.max( oldx, newx ) + width ) - x;
        int h = ( Math.max( oldy, newy ) + height ) - y;
        g.setClip( x, y, w, h );
    }
    public void update( Graphics g ) {
        int lastX = currentX, lastY = currentY;
        currentX = nextX; currentY = nextY;
        clipToAffectedArea( g, lastX, lastY, currentX, currentY, imgWidth, imgHeight );
        paint( g );
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
You should find that <tt class=literal>ClippedFlicker</tt> is
significantly faster, though it still flickers. We'll make one
more change in the next section to eliminate that.

<p class=para>
So, what have we changed? First, we've overridden
<tt class=literal>mouseDragged()</tt> so that instead of setting the
current coordinates of the image, it sets another pair of coordinates
called <tt class=literal>nextX</tt> and <tt class=literal>nextY</tt>. These
are the coordinates at which we'll display the image the next time we
draw it.

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>update()</tt> now has the added responsibility of taking
the next position and making it the current position, by setting the
<tt class=literal>currentX</tt> and <tt class=literal>currentY</tt>
variables. This effectively decouples
<tt class=literal>mouseDragged()</tt> from our painting routines. We'll
discuss why this is advantageous in a bit. <tt class=literal>update()</tt>
then uses the current and next coordinates to set a clipping region on
the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object before handing it off to
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt>.

<p class=para>
We have created a new, <tt class=literal>private</tt> method to help it do
this. <tt class=literal>clipToAffectedArea()</tt> takes as arguments the
new and old coordinates and the width and height of the image. It
determines the bounding rectangle as shown in 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-13-FIG-6">Figure 13.6</A>, then calls <tt class=literal>setClip()</tt> to
set the clipping region. As a result, when <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>
is called, it draws only the affected area of the screen.

<p class=para>
So, what's the deal with <tt class=literal>nextX</tt> and
<tt class=literal>nextY</tt>?  By making <tt class=literal>update()</tt> keep
track of the next, current, and last coordinates separately, we
accomplish two things. First, we always have an accurate view of where
the last image was drawn and second, we have decoupled where the next
image will be drawn from <tt class=literal>mouseDragged()</tt>.

<p class=para>
It's important to decouple painting from
<tt class=literal>mouseDragged()</tt> because there isn't necessarily a
one-to-one correspondence between calls to
<tt class=literal>repaint()</tt> and subsequent calls by
AWT to our <tt class=literal>update()</tt> method. This
isn't a defect; it's a feature that allows AWT to
schedule and consolidate painting requests.  Our concern is that our
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method may be called at arbitrary times
while the mouse coordinates are changing. This is not necessarily
bad. If we are trying to position our object, we probably don't want
the display to be redrawn for every intermediate position of the
mouse. It would slow down the dragging unnecessarily.

<p class=para>
If we were concerned about getting every single change in the mouse's
position, we would have two options. We could either do some work in
the <tt class=literal>mouseDragged()</tt> method itself, or put our events
into some kind of queue. We'll see an example of the first solution in
our <tt class=literal>DoodlePad</tt> example a bit later. The latter
solution would mean circumventing AWT's own
event-scheduling capabilities and replacing them with our own, and we
don't want to take on that responsibility.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-13-SECT-4.2">Double Buffering</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.DB"></A><a name="CH11.DB2"></A>Now let's get to the most powerful technique in our toolbox:
<i class=emphasis>double buffering</I>. Double buffering is a technique
that fixes our flickering problems completely. It's easy to do and
gives us almost flawless updates. We'll combine it with our
clipping technique for better performance, but in general you can use
double buffering with or without clipping.

<p class=para>
Double buffering our display means drawing into an off-screen
buffer and then copying our completed work to the display in a single
painting operation, as shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-13-FIG-8">Figure 13.8</A>. It
takes the same amount of time to draw a frame, but double buffering
instantaneously updates our display when it's ready.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-13-FIG-8">Figure 13.8: Double buffering</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je1308.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 13-8]" width=503 height=182 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
We can get this effect by changing just a few lines of our
<tt class=literal>ClippedFlicker</tt> applet. Modify
<tt class=literal>update()</tt> to look like the following and add the
new <tt class=literal>offScreenImage</tt> instance variable as shown:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
... 
public class DoubleBufferedClipped extends ClippedFlicker { 
    Image offScreenImage;
    Graphics offScreenGC;
    public void update( Graphics g ) {
        if ( offScreenImage == null ) {
            offScreenImage = createImage( getSize().width, getSize().height );
            offScreenGC = img.getGraphics();
        }
        int lastX = currentX, lastY = currentY;
        currentX = nextX; currentY = nextY;
        clipToAffectedArea( offScreenGC, lastX, lastY, currentX, currentY, imgWidth, imgHeight );
        clipToAffectedArea( g, lastX, lastY, currentX, currentY, imgWidth, imgHeight );
        paint( offScreenGC );
        g.drawImage(offScreenImage, 0, 0, this);
    }
}
... 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Now, when you drag the image, you shouldn't see any
flickering. The update rate should be about the same as in the
previous example (or marginally slower), but the image should move
from position to position without noticeable repainting.

<p class=para>
So, what have we done this time? Well, the new instance variable,
<tt class=literal>offScreenImage</tt>, is our off-screen buffer. It is a
drawable <tt class=literal>Image</tt> object. We can get an off-screen
<tt class=literal>Image</tt> for a component with the
<tt class=literal>createImage()</tt>
method. <tt class=literal>createImage()</tt> is similar to
<tt class=literal>getImage()</tt>, except that it produces an empty image
area of the specified size. We can then use the off-screen image like
our standard display area by asking it for a graphics context with the
<tt class=literal>Image getGraphics()</tt> method. After we've drawn into
the off-screen image, we can copy that image back onto the screen with
<tt class=literal>drawImage()</tt>.

<p class=para>
The biggest change to the code is that we now pass
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> the graphics context of our off-screen
buffer, rather than that of the on-screen
display. <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> is now drawing on
<tt class=literal>offScreenImage</tt>; it's our job to copy the image to
the display when it's done. This might seem a little suspicious to
you, as we are now using <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> in two
capacities. AWT calls <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>
whenever it's necessary to repaint our entire applet and passes it an
on-screen graphics context. When we update ourselves, however, we call
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> to do its work on our off-screen area and
then copy that image onto the screen from within
<tt class=literal>update()</tt>.

<p class=para>
Note that we're still clipping. In fact, we're clipping both
the on-screen and off-screen buffers. Off-screen clipping has the same
benefits we described earlier: AWT should be
able to ignore wasted drawing operations. On-screen clipping
minimizes the area of the image that gets drawn back to the
display. If your display is fast, you might not even notice the
savings, but it's an easy optimization, so we'll take advantage
of it.

<p class=para>
We create the off-screen buffer in <tt class=literal>update()</tt>
because it's a convenient and safe place to do so. 
Also, note that our image observer probably won't be called, since
<tt class=literal>drawImage()</tt> isn't doing anything nasty like
scaling, and the image itself is always available.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>dispose()</tt> method of the
<tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class allows us to deallocate a graphics
context explicitly when we are through with it. This is simply an
optimization.  If we were creating new graphics contexts frequently (say, 
in each paint()), we could give the system help in getting rid of them.
This might provide some performance improvement when doing
heavy drawing. We could allow garbage collection to reclaim the unused
objects; however, the garbage collection process might be hampered if
we are doing intense calculations or lots of repainting.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-13-SECT-4.3">Off-Screen Drawing</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH11.OFF"></A><a name="CH11.OFF2"></A>In addition to serving as buffers for double buffering, off-screen
images are useful for saving complex, hard-to-produce, background
information. We'll look at a simple example: the "doodle
pad." <tt class=literal>DoodlePad</tt> is a simple drawing tool that
lets us scribble by dragging the mouse, as shown in 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-13-FIG-9">Figure 13.9</A>. It draws into an off-screen image; its
<tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method simply copies the image to the
display area.

<p class=para>
Give it a try. Draw a nice moose, or a sunset. I just drew a lovely
cartoon of Bill Gates. If you make a mistake, hit the
<b>Clear</b> button and start over.

<p class=para>
The parts should be familiar by now. We have made a type of
<tt class=literal>Canvas</tt> called <tt class=literal>DrawPad</tt>. The new
<tt class=literal>DrawPad</tt> component handles mouse events by enabling
both simple mouse events (mouse clicks) and mouse motion events (mouse
drags), and then overriding the <tt class=literal>processEvent()</tt>
method to handle these events. By doing so, we are simulating the old
(Java 1.0) event handling model; in this situation, it's a little more
convenient than implementing all the methods of the
<tt class=literal>MouseListener</tt> and
<tt class=literal>MouseMotionListener</tt> interfaces. The
<tt class=literal>processEvent()</tt> method handles
<tt class=literal>MOUSE_DRAGGED</tt> movement events by drawing lines into
an off-screen image and calling <tt class=literal>repaint()</tt> to update
the display. <tt class=literal>DrawPad</tt>'s <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>
method simply does a <tt class=literal>drawImage()</tt> to copy the
off-screen drawing area to the display. In this way,
<tt class=literal>DrawPad</tt> saves our sketch information.

<p class=para>
What is unusual about <tt class=literal>DrawPad</tt> is that it
does some drawing outside of <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> or
<tt class=literal>update()</tt>. In our clipping example, we
talked about decoupling <tt class=literal>update()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>mouseDragged()</tt>; we were willing to discard
some mouse movements in order to save some updates. In this case, we
want to let the user scribble with the mouse, so we should respond to
every mouse movement. Therefore, we do our work in
<tt class=literal>processEvent()</tt> itself. As a rule, we
should be careful about doing heavy work in event handling methods
because we don't want to interfere with other tasks the
AWT thread is performing. In this case, our line
drawing operation should not be a burden, and our primary concern is
getting as close a coupling as possible between the mouse movement
events and the sketch on the screen.

<p class=para>
In addition to drawing a line as the user drags the mouse, the part of
<tt class=literal>processEvent()</tt> that handles
<tt class=literal>MOUSE_DRAGGED()</tt> events maintains a set of old
coordinates, to be used as a starting point for the next line
segment. The part of <tt class=literal>processEvent()</tt> that handles
<tt class=literal>MOUSE_PRESSED</tt> events resets the old coordinates to
the current mouse position whenever the user picks up and moves to a
new location. Finally, <tt class=literal>DrawPad</tt> provides a
<tt class=literal>clear()</tt> method that clears the off-screen buffer
and calls <tt class=literal>repaint()</tt> to update the display. The
<tt class=literal>DoodlePad</tt> applet ties the
<tt class=literal>clear()</tt> method to an appropriately labeled button
through its <tt class=literal>actionPerformed()</tt> method.

<p class=para>
What if we wanted to do something with the image after the user
has finished scribbling on it? Well, as we'll see in the next
section, we could get the pixel data for the image from its
<tt class=literal>ImageProducer</tt> object and work with that. It
wouldn't be hard to create a save facility that stores the pixel data
and reproduces it later. Think about how you might go about creating a
networked "bathroom wall" where people could scribble on
your Web pages.
