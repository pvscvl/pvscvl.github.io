<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-2">5.2 Methods</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.METH"></A>Methods appear inside class bodies. They contain local variable declarations 
and other Java statements that are executed by a calling
thread when the method is invoked. Method declarations in Java look
like ANSI C-style function declarations with two
restrictions:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>A method in Java always specifies a return type (there's no
default). The returned value can be a primitive numeric type, a
reference type, or the type <tt class=literal>void</tt>, which indicates
no returned value.

<p>
<li class=listitem>A method always 
has a fixed number of arguments. The combination of method overloading 
and true arrays removes most of the need for a variable number of arguments. 
These techniques are type-safe and easier to use than C's variable 
argument list mechanism. 

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
Here's a simple example: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Bird { 
    int xPos, yPos; 
 
    double fly ( int x, int y ) { 
        double distance = Math.sqrt( x*x + y*y ); 
        flap( distance ); 
        xPos = x; 
        yPos = y; 
        return distance; 
    } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In this example, the class <tt class=literal>Bird</tt> defines 
a method, <tt class=literal>fly()</tt>, that takes as arguments two 
integers: <tt class=literal>x</tt> and <tt class=literal>y</tt>. It 
returns a <tt class=literal>double</tt> type value as a result. 

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-2.1">Local Variables</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>fly()</tt> method declares a local variable called
<tt class=literal>distance</tt> that it uses to compute the distance
flown. A local variable is temporary;  it exists only
within the scope of its method. Local variables are allocated and
initialized when a method is invoked; they are normally destroyed when the
method returns. They can't be referenced from outside the method
itself. If the method is executing concurrently in different threads,
each thread has its own copies of the method's local
variables. A method's arguments also serve as local variables
within the scope of the method.

<p class=para>
An object created within a method and assigned to a
local variable may or may not persist after the method has
returned. As with all objects in Java, it depends on whether any
references to the object remain. If an object is created, assigned to
a local variable, and never used anywhere else, that object will no
longer be referenced when the local variable is destroyed, so garbage
collection will remove the object. If, however, we assign the object to
an instance variable, pass it as an argument to another method, or
pass it back as a return value, it may be saved by another variable
holding its reference. We'll discuss object creation and garbage
collection in more detail shortly.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-2.2">Shadowing</A></h3>

<p class=para>
If a local variable and an instance variable have the same name, the
local variable <i class=emphasis>shadows</I> or hides the name of the
instance variable within the scope of the method. In the following
example, the local variables <tt class=literal>xPos</tt> and
<tt class=literal>yPos</tt> hide the instance variables of the same name:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Bird { 
    int xPos, yPos; 
    int xNest, yNest; 
    ... 
    double flyToNest() { 
        int xPos = xNest; 
        int yPos = yNest: 
        return ( fly( xPos, yPos ) ); 
    } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
When we set the values of the local variables in
<tt class=literal>flyToNest()</tt>, it has no effect on the values of the
instance variables.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch05-SECT3-AUTOID.1">this</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The special reference <tt class=literal>this</tt> refers to the
current object.  You can use it any time you need to refer explicitly to the
current object instance. Often, you don't need to use
<tt class=literal>this</tt> because the reference to the current object is
implicit; this is the case with using instance variables and methods
inside of a class. But we can use <tt class=literal>this</tt> to refer
explicitly to instance variables in the object, even if they are
shadowed.

<p class=para>
The subsequent example shows how we can use
<tt class=literal>this</tt> to allow us argument names that shadow
instance variable names. This is a fairly common technique, as it
saves your having to deliberately make up alternate
names (as we'll try to emphasize in this book, names are important). 
Here's how we could implement our
<tt class=literal>fly()</tt> method with shadowed variables:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Bird { 
    int xPos, yPos; 
 
    double fly ( int xPos, int yPos ) { 
        double distance = Math.sqrt( xPos*xPos + yPos*yPos ); 
        flap( distance ); 
        this.xPos = xPos; 
        this.yPos = yPos; 
        return distance; 
    } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In this example, the expression <tt class=literal>this.xPos</tt>
refers to the instance variable <tt class=literal>xPos</tt> and assigns it
the value of the local variable <tt class=literal>xPos</tt>, which would
otherwise hide its name. The only reason we need to use
<tt class=literal>this</tt> in the above example is because we've
used argument names that hide our instance variables, and we want to
refer to the instance variables.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-2.3">Static Methods</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.STAT6"></A><a name="CH05.STAT7"></A>Static methods (class methods), like static variables, belong to the
class and not to an individual instance of the class. What does this
mean?  
Well, foremost, a static method lives outside of any particular class
instance.  It can be invoked by name, through the class name, without any 
objects around.  
Because it is not bound to a particular object instance, a static method 
can only directly access other static members of classes.  
It can't directly see any instance variables or call any instance methods,
because to do so we'd have to ask: "on which instance?"
Static methods can be called from instances, just like instance methods, but
the important thing is that they can also be used independently.

<p class=para>
Our <tt class=literal>fly()</tt> method uses a static method:
<tt class=literal>Math.sqrt()</tt>. This method is defined by the
<tt class=literal>java.lang.Math</tt> class; we'll explore this
class in detail in <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, <i>Basic Utility Classes</i></A>. 
For now, the important
thing to note is that <tt class=literal>Math</tt> is the name of a class
and not an instance of a <tt class=literal>Math</tt> object (you can't even make an instance of
<tt class=literal>Math</tt>). Because <tt class=literal>static</tt> methods
can be invoked wherever the class name is available, class methods are
closer to normal C-style functions. Static methods are
particularly useful for utility methods that perform work that might
be useful either independently of instances of the class or in
creating instances of the class.

<p class=para>
For example, in our <tt class=literal>Bird</tt> class we can enumerate 
all types of birds that can be created: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Bird { 
    ... 
    static String [] getBirdTypes( ) { 
    String [] types; 
    // Create list...
        return types; 
    } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Here we've defined a <tt class=literal>static</tt> method
<tt class=literal>getBirdTypes()</tt> that returns an array of strings
containing bird names. We can use <tt class=literal>getBirdTypes()</tt>
from within an instance of <tt class=literal>Bird</tt>, just like an
instance method. However, we can also call it from other classes,
using the <tt class=literal>Bird</tt> class name as a reference:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
String [] names = Bird.getBirdTypes(); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Perhaps a special version of the <tt class=literal>Bird</tt> class
constructor accepts the name of a bird type. We could use this list to
decide what kind of bird to create.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-2.4">Local Variable Initialization</A></h3>

<p class=para>
In the <tt class=literal>flyToNest()</tt> example, we made a point of
initializing the local variables <tt class=literal>xPos</tt> and
<tt class=literal>yPos</tt>. Unlike instance variables, local variables
must be initialized before they can be used. It's a compile-time
error to try to access a local variable without first assigning it a value:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
void myMethod() { 
    int foo = 42; 
    int bar; 
 
    // bar += 1;       // Compile time error, bar uninitialized
 
    bar = 99; 
    bar += 1;       // ok here
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Notice that this doesn't imply local variables have to be
initialized when declared, just that the first time they are
referenced must be in an assignment. More subtle possibilities arise
when making assignments inside of conditionals:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
void myMethod { 
    int foo; 
 
    if ( someCondition ) { 
        foo = 42; 
        ... 
    } 
 
    foo += 1;                  // Compile time error 
                               // foo may not have been initialized 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In the above example, <tt class=literal>foo</tt> is initialized only if
<tt class=literal>someCondition</tt> is <tt class=literal>true</tt>. The
compiler doesn't let you make this wager, so it flags the use of
<tt class=literal>foo</tt> as an error. We could correct this situation in
several ways. We could initialize the variable to a default value in
advance or move the usage inside of the conditional. We could also make sure
the path of execution doesn't reach the uninitialized variable through
some other means, depending on what makes sense for our particular
application. For example, we could return from the method
abruptly:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
int foo; 
... 
if ( someCondition ) { 
    foo = 42; 
    ... 
} else 
    return;   
 
foo += 1; 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In this case, there's no chance of reaching <tt class=literal>foo</tt> in
an unused state and the compiler allows the use of
<tt class=literal>foo</tt> after the conditional.

<p class=para>
Why is Java so picky about local variables? One of the most common (and 
insidious) sources of error in C or C++ is forgetting to initialize local 
variables, so Java tries to help us out. If it didn't, Java would suffer the same potential irregularities as C or C++.[2]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
As with <tt class=literal>malloc</tt>'ed storage in C or C++, Java objects
and their instance variables are allocated on a heap, which allows
them default values once, when they are created. Local
variables, however, are allocated on the Java virtual machine
stack. As with the stack in C and C++, failing to initialize these
could mean successive method calls could receive garbage values,
and program execution might be inconsistent or implementation
dependent.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-2.5">Argument Passing and References</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.PASS1"></A><a name="CH05.PASS2"></A><a name="CH05.PASS3"></A>Let's consider what happens when you pass arguments to a method.
All primitive data types (e.g., <tt class=literal>int</tt>,
<tt class=literal>char</tt>, <tt class=literal>float</tt>) are passed by
value. Now you're probably used to the idea that reference types
(i.e., any kind of object, including arrays and strings) are used
through references. An important distinction (that we discussed briefly
in Chapter 4) is that the references themselves (the pointers to these objects) 
are actually primitive types, and are passed by value too.

<p class=para>
Consider the following piece of code: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
// somewhere
    int i = 0; 
    SomeKindOfObject obj = new SomeKindOfObject(); 
    myMethod( i, obj ); 
    ... 
void myMethod(int j, SomeKindOfObject o) { 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The first chunk of code calls <tt class=literal>myMethod()</tt>, passing 
it two arguments. The first argument, <tt class=literal>i</tt>, is passed 
by value; when the method is called, the value of <tt class=literal>i</tt> 
is copied into the method's parameter <tt class=literal>j</tt>. 
If <tt class=literal>myMethod()</tt> changes the value of <tt class=literal>i</tt>, 
it's changing only its copy of the local variable. 

<p class=para>
In the same way, a copy of the reference to
<tt class=literal>obj</tt> is placed into the reference variable
<tt class=literal>o</tt> of <tt class=literal>myMethod()</tt>. Both
references refer to the same object, of course, and any changes made
through either reference affect the actual (single) object instance,
but there are two copies of the pointer. If we change the value of,
say, <tt class=literal>o.size</tt>, the change is visible through either
reference. However, if <tt class=literal>myMethod()</tt> changes the
reference <tt class=literal>o</tt> itself--to point to another
object--it's affecting only its copy. In this sense, passing the
reference is like passing a pointer in C and
<i class=emphasis>unlike</I> passing by reference in C++.

<p class=para>
What if <tt class=literal>myMethod()</tt> needs to modify the calling 
method's notion of the <tt class=literal>obj</tt> reference as well (i.e., 
make <tt class=literal>obj</tt> point to a different object)? The easy 
way to do that is to wrap <tt class=literal>obj</tt> inside some kind 
of object.  A good candidate would be to wrap the object up as the lone
element in an array:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
SomeKindOfObject [] wrapper = { obj };
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
All parties could then refer to the object as wrapper[0] and would have
the ability to change the reference.  This is not very asthetically 
pleasing, but it does illustrate that what is needed is the level of 
indirection.  Another possibility is to use 
<tt class=literal>this</tt> to pass a reference 
to the calling object. 

<p class=para>
Let's look at another piece of code that could be from an implementation of 
a linked list: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Element { 
    public Element nextElement; 
 
    void addToList( List list ) { 
        list.addToList( this ); 
    } 
} 
 
class List { 
    void addToList( Element element ) { 
        ... 
        element.nextElement = getNextElement(); 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Every element in a linked list contains a pointer to the next element
in the list. In this code, the <tt class=literal>Element</tt> class
represents one element; it includes a method for adding itself to the
list. The <tt class=literal>List</tt> class itself contains a method for
adding an arbitrary <tt class=literal>Element</tt> to the list. The method
<tt class=literal>addToList()</tt> calls
<tt class=literal>addToList()</tt> with the argument
<tt class=literal>this</tt> (which is, of course, an
<tt class=literal>Element</tt>). <tt class=literal>addToList()</tt> can use
the <tt class=literal>this</tt> reference to modify the
<tt class=literal>Element</tt>'s <tt class=literal>nextElement</tt>
instance variable. The same technique can be used in conjunction with 
interfaces to implement callbacks for arbitrary method invocations.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-2.6">Method Overloading</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.OVER1"></A><a name="CH05.OVER2"></A><i class=emphasis>Method overloading</I> is the ability to define 
multiple methods with the same name in a class; when the method is invoked, 
the compiler picks the correct one based on the arguments passed to the 
method. This implies, of course, that overloaded methods must have different 
numbers or types of arguments. In a later section we'll look at method 
overriding, which occurs when we declare methods with identical signatures 
in different classes. 

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.PRINT"></A>Method overloading is a powerful and useful feature. It's another form of 
polymorphism (ad-hoc polymorphism).  The idea is to create methods that act 
in the same way on different types of arguments and have what appears to
be a single method that operates on any of the types. The Java
<tt class=literal>PrintStream</tt>'s <tt class=literal>print()</tt>
method is a good example of method overloading in action. As you've
probably deduced by now, you 
can print a string representation of just
about anything using the expression:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
System.out.print( <tt class=replaceable><i>argument</i></tt> ) 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The variable <tt class=literal>out</tt> is a reference to an object (a
<tt class=literal>PrintStream</tt>) that defines nine different versions
of the <tt class=literal>print()</tt> method. They take, respectively,
arguments of the following types: <tt class=literal>Object</tt>,
<tt class=literal>String</tt>, <tt class=literal>char[]</tt>,
<tt class=literal>char</tt>, <tt class=literal>int</tt>,
<tt class=literal>long</tt>, <tt class=literal>float</tt>,
<tt class=literal>double</tt>, and <tt class=literal>boolean</tt>.

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class PrintStream { 
    void print( Object arg ) { ... } 
    void print( String arg ) { ... } 
    void print( char [] arg ) { ... } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
You can invoke the <tt class=literal>print()</tt> method 
with any of these types as an argument, and it's printed in an appropriate 
way. In a language without method overloading, this would require something 
more cumbersome, such as a separate method for printing each type 
of object. Then it would be your responsibility to remember what method 
to use for each data type. 

<p class=para>
In the above example, <tt class=literal>print()</tt> has been
overloaded to support two reference types: <tt class=literal>Object</tt>
and <tt class=literal>String</tt>. What if we try to call
<tt class=literal>print()</tt> with some other reference type? Say,
perhaps, a <tt class=literal>Date</tt> object?  The answer is that since
<tt class=literal>Date</tt> is a subclass of <tt class=literal>Object</tt>,
the <tt class=literal>Object</tt> method is selected. When there's not an
exact type match, the compiler searches for an acceptable, assignable
match. Since <tt class=literal>Date</tt>, like all classes, is a subclass
of <tt class=literal>Object</tt>, a <tt class=literal>Date</tt> object can be
assigned to a variable of type <tt class=literal>Object</tt>. It's
therefore an acceptable match, and the <tt class=literal>Object</tt>
method is selected.

<p class=para>
But what if there's more than one possible match? Say, for
example, we tried to print a subclass of <tt class=literal>String</tt>
called <tt class=literal>MyString</tt>. (Of course, the
<tt class=literal>String</tt> class is <tt class=literal>final</tt>, so it
can't be subclassed, but allow me this brief transgression for
purposes of explanation.) <tt class=literal>MyString</tt> is assignable to
either <tt class=literal>String</tt> or to <tt class=literal>Object</tt>.
Here the compiler makes a determination as to which match is "better"
and selects that method. In this case it's the 
<tt class=literal>String</tt> method.

<p class=para>
The intuitive explanation is that the <tt class=literal>String</tt> class
is closer to <tt class=literal>MyString</tt> in the inheritance hierarchy.
It is a <i class=emphasis>more specific</I> match.  A more rigorous way
of specifying it would be to say that a given method is more specific
than another method with respect to some arguments it wants to accept
if the argument types of the first method are all assignable to the
argument types of the second method.  In this case, the
<tt class=literal>String</tt> method is more specific to a subclass of
<tt class=literal>String</tt> than the <tt class=literal>Object</tt> method
because type <tt class=literal>String</tt> is assignable to type
<tt class=literal>Object</tt>.  The reverse is obviously not true.

<p class=para>
If you're paying close attention, you may have noticed I
said that the compiler resolves overloaded methods. Method overloading
is not something that happens at run-time; this is an important
distinction. It means that the selected method is chosen once, when
the code is compiled. Once the overloaded method is selected, the
choice is fixed until the code is recompiled, even if the class
containing the called method is later revised and an even more specific
overloaded method is added. This is in contrast to overridden
(virtual) methods, which are located at run-time and can be found even
if they didn't exist when the calling class was compiled. We'll
talk about method overriding later in the chapter.

<p class=para>
One last note about overloading. In earlier chapters, we've pointed 
out that Java doesn't support programmer-defined overloaded operators, 
and that <tt class=literal>+</tt> is the only system-defined overloaded 
operator. If you've been wondering what an overloaded operator is, 
I can finally clear up that mystery. In a language like C++, you can customize 
operators such as <tt class=literal>+</tt> and <tt class=literal>*</tt> 
to work with objects that you create. For example, you could create a class 
<tt class=literal>Complex</tt> that implements complex numbers, and 
then overload methods corresponding to <tt class=literal>+</tt> 
and <tt class=literal>*</tt> to add and multiply 
<tt class=literal>Complex</tt> objects.
Some people argue that operator overloading makes for elegant and readable 
programs, while others say it's just "syntactic sugar" 
that makes for obfuscated code. The Java designers clearly espoused 
the later opinion when they chose not to support programmer-defined overloaded 
operators.
