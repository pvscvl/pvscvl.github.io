<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-10-SECT-2">10.2 Applets</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH10.APP1"></A>If you've been waiting for a more detailed discussion of the applet class, 
here it is. For examples of writing applets, please see <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>A First Applet</i></A> (the tutorial) 
and the examples in <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, <i>Using and Creating GUI Components</i></A> and throughout the book.

<p class=para>
An <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> is something like a 
<tt class=literal>Panel</tt> with a mission.  
It is a GUI Container that has some extra structure to allow it to be used
in an "alien" environment like a Web browser or appletviewer.
Applets also have a life-cycle that lets them act more like 
an application than a static component.
Although applets tend to be relatively simple, there's no inherent
restriction on their complexity. There's no reason you couldn't write
an air traffic control system (well, let's be less ambitious: a word
processor) as an applet.
<p class=para>
Structurally, an applet is a sort of wrapper for your Java code.  In
contrast to a standalone graphical Java application, which starts up
from a <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method and creates a GUI, an
applet is itself a Component that expects to be dropped into someone
else's GUI.  Thus, an applet can't run by itself; it runs in the
context of a Web browser or an appletviewer.  Instead of having your
application create a <tt class=literal>Frame</tt> to hold your
GUI, you stuff your application inside an
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> (which is itself a Container) and let someone else
add the applet to their GUI.
<p class=para>
Pragmatically, an applet is an intruder into someone else's
environment, and therefore has to be treated with suspicion. The Web
browsers that run applets impose restrictions on what the applet is
allowed to do. The restrictions are enforced by a security manager,
which the applet is not allowed to change. The browser also provides
an "applet context," which is additional support that helps the applet
live within its restrictions. 
<p class=para>
Aside from that top level structure and the security restrictions,
there is no difference between an applet and an application.  If your
application can live within the restrictions imposed by a browser's
security manager, you can easily structure it to function as an applet
and a standalone application. (We'll show an example of an Applet
that can also be run as a standalone below.)  Conversely, if you can
supply all of the things that an applet requires from its environment,
you can use applets within your stand-alone applications and within
other applets (though this requires a bit of work).
<p class=para>
As we said a moment ago, an <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>
expects to be embedded in GUI (perhaps a document) and used in a viewing 
environment that provides it with special resources. 
In all other respects,
however, applets are just ordinary <tt class=literal>Panel</tt>
objects.  (See <a href="#EXJ-CH-10-FIG-8">Figure 10.8</A>.)  Like a 
<tt class=literal>Panel</tt>, an <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>
can contain user-interface components and implement all the basic
drawing and event-handling capabilities of the
<tt class=literal>Component</tt> class. We draw on an
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> by overriding its <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>
method; we respond to events in the
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt>'s display area by providing the
appropriate event-listeners.  The additional structure
applets have helps them interact with the viewer environment.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-10-SECT-2.1">Applet Control</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class contains four methods an
applet can override to guide it through its life cycle. The
<tt class=literal>init()</tt>, <tt class=literal>start()</tt>,
<tt class=literal>stop()</tt>, and <tt class=literal>destroy()</tt> methods are
called by an applet viewer, such as a Web browser, to direct the
applet's behavior. <tt class=literal>init()</tt> is called once,
after the applet is created. The <tt class=literal>init()</tt> method
is where you perform basic setup like parsing parameters, building a
user interface, and loading resources.  Given what we've said
about objects,
you might expect the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>'s constructor would 
be the right place
for such initialization.  However, the constructor is meant to be 
called by the applet's environment, for simple creation of the applet.
This might happen before the applet has access to certain resources, 
like information about its environment. Therefore, an applet doesn't normally
do any work in its constructor; it relies on the default constructor for the
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class and does its initialization in the
<tt class=literal>init()</tt> method.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method is called whenever the
applet becomes visible; it shouldn't be a surprise then that the
<tt class=literal>stop()</tt> method is called whenever the applet becomes
invisible.  <tt class=literal>init()</tt> is only called once in
the life of an applet, but <tt class=literal>start()</tt> 
and <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> can be called any number of times (but always in the logical 
sequence).
For example, <tt class=literal>start()</tt> is called when the
applet is displayed, such as when it 
scrolls onto the screen; <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> is called if
the applet scrolls off the screen or the viewer leaves the
document. <tt class=literal>start()</tt> tells the applet
it should be active.  The applet may want to create threads, animate, or
otherwise perform useful (or annoying)
activity. <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> is called to let the applet know
it should go dormant. 
Applets should cease CPU-intensive or
wasteful activity when they are stopped and resume it when (and if)
they are restarted. However, there's no requirement that an
invisible applet stop computing; in some applications, it may be
useful for the applet to continue running in the background.  Just be
considerate of your user, who doesn't want an invisible applet
dragging down system performance.  And for the users: be aware of the tools
that will develop to let you monitor and squash rogue applets in 
your web browser.

<p class=para>
Finally, the <tt class=literal>destroy()</tt> method is called to give the
applet a last chance to clean up before it's removed--some time
after the call to <tt class=literal>stop()</tt>. For example, an applet
might want to close down suspended communications channels or remove
graphics frames. Exactly when <tt class=literal>destroy()</tt> is called
depends on the applet viewer; Netscape Navigator calls
<tt class=literal>destroy()</tt> just prior to deleting the applet from
its cache. This means that although an applet can cling to life after
being told to <tt class=literal>stop()</tt>, how long it can go on
is unpredictable. If you want to maintain your applet as the
user progresses through other activities, consider putting
it in an HTML frame (see 
<a href="#EXJ-CH-10-SECT-2.2.2">"Driving the Browser"</A> later in this chapter).

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT2-AUTOID.2">The Applet security Sandbox</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Applets are quarantined within the browser by an applet
<tt class=literal>SecurityManager</tt>.  The
<tt class=literal>SecurityManager</tt> is part of the application
that runs the applet, e.g., the web browser or applet viewer.  It is
installed before the browser loads any applets and implements the
basic restrictions that let you run untrusted applets safely.
Remember that, aside from basic language robustness, there are no
inherent security restrictions on a standalone Java application.  It
is the browser's responsibility to install a special security
manager and limit what applets are allowed to do.  
<p class=para>

Most browsers impose the following restrictions on untrusted applets:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Untrusted Applets cannot read or write files on the local host.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Untrusted Applets can only open network connections (sockets) to
the server from which they originated.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Untrusted Applets cannot start other processes on the local host.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Untrusted Applets cannot have native methods.

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
We discuss these restrictions in more detail in the relevant chapters
in this book. However, the motivation for these restrictions should be
fairly obvious: you clearly wouldn't want a program coming from some
random Internet site to access your files, or run arbitrary
programs. Although untrusted applets cannot directly read and write
files on the client side or talk to arbitrary hosts on the network,
applets can work with servers to store data and communicate.  For
example, an applet can use Java's RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
facility to do processing on its server.  An applet can communicate
with other applets on the Net by proxy through its server.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.14">Trusted Applets</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The latest version of Java makes it possible to sign archive files
that contain applets. Because a signature identifies the applet's
origin unambiguously, we can now distinguish between "trusted" applets
(i.e., applets that come from a site or person you trust not to do
anything harmful) and run of the mill "untrusted" applets.  In web
browsers that support signing, trusted applets can be granted
permission to "go outside" of the applet security sandbox.  Trusted
applets can be allowed to do most of the things that standalone Java
applications can do: read and write files, open network connections to
arbitrary machines, and interact with the local operating system by
starting processes.  Trusted applets still can't have native methods,
but including native methods in an applet would make it unportable,
and would therefore be a bad idea.
<p class=para>
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, <i>Tools of the Trade</i></A> discusses how to package your applet's class files
and resources into a JAR file and sign it with your digital signature.
Currently, HotJava is the only browser that supports signing, but
Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, and others will probably catch
up soon.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-10-SECT-2.2">Getting Applet Resources</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH10.APP2"></A><a name="CH10.APP3"></A>
An applet needs to communicate with its applet viewer. For example, it needs
to get its parameters from the HTML document in which
it appears.  An applet may also need to load images, audio clips, and other 
items.  It may also want to ask the viewer about other applets on the same 
HTML
page in order to communicate with them. 
To get resources from the applet viewer environment, applets use the
<tt class=literal>AppletStub</tt> and <tt class=literal>AppletContext</tt>
interfaces. Unless you're writing a browser or some other
application that loads and runs applets, you won't have to implement these 
interfaces, but you do use them within your applet.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.15">Applet Parameters</A></h4>

<p class=para>
An applet gets its parameters from the parameter tags
placed inside the <tt class=literal>&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag in the
HTML document.  For example, the code below reads
the "sheep" parameter from its HTML page:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
String imageName = getParameter( "imageName" ); 
try  {
    int numberOfSheep = Integer.parseInt(getParameter( "sheep" )); 
} catch ( NumberFormatException e ) { // use default } 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
A friendly applet will provide information about the parameters it 
accepts through its <tt class=literal>getParameterInfo()</tt> method.  <tt class=literal>getParameterInfo()</tt> returns
an array of string arrays, listing and describing the applet's parameters.  
For each parameter, three strings are provided: the parameter name, its
possible values or value types, and a verbose description.  For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public String [][] getParameterInfo() {
    String [][] appletInfo = 
        {"logo",   "url",  "Main logo image"}
        {"timer", "int",   "Time to wait before becoming annoying"},
        {"flashing", "constant | intermittant",  "Flag for how to flash"},
    return appletInfo;
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.16">Applet Resources</A></h4>

<p class=para>
An applet can find where it lives by calling the
<tt class=literal>getDocumentBase()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>getCodeBase()</tt>
methods. <tt class=literal>getDocumentBase()</tt> returns the base
URL of the document in which the applet appears;
<tt class=literal>getCodeBase()</tt> returns the base
URL of the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt>'s class
files. An applet can use these to construct relative
URLs from which to load other resources like images, 
sounds, and other data.
The <tt class=literal>getImage()</tt> method takes a URL and asks for 
an image from the viewer environment. The image may be pulled from a cache 
or loaded asynchronously when later used. The
<tt class=literal>getAudioClip()</tt> method, similarly, retrieves sound
clips.  
See <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, <i>Network Programming</i></A> for a full discussion of how to work with URLs, and
<a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, <i>Using and Creating GUI Components</i></A> for examples of applets that load images.

<p class=para>
The following example uses
<tt class=literal>getCodeBase()</tt> to construct a
URL and load a properties-configuration file, located
at the same location as the applet's class file. (See
<a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, <i>Basic Utility Classes</i></A> for a discussion of properties.)

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
Properties props = new Properties(); 
try {
    URL url = new URL(getCodeBase(), "appletConfig.props");
    props.load( url.openStream() ); 
} catch ( IOException e ) { // failed } 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
A better way to load resources is by calling the <tt class=literal>getResource()</tt>
and <tt class=literal>getResourceAsStream()</tt> methods of the <tt class=literal>Class</tt> class, which search 
the applet's JAR files (if any) as well as its codebase.
See <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, <i>Input/Output Facilities</i></A> for a discussion of resource loading.  The following
code loads
the properties file appletConfig.props:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
Properties props = new Properties(); 
try {
    props.load( getClass().getResourceAsStream("appletConfig.props") );
} catch ( IOException e ) { // failed } 
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-10-SECT-2.2.2">Driving the Browser</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The status line is a blurb of text that usually appears somewhere in the
viewer's display, indicating a current activity. An applet can
request that some text be placed in the status line with the
<tt class=literal>showStatus()</tt> method. (The browser isn't
required to do anything in response to this call, but most browsers
will oblige you.)
<p class=para>
An applet can also ask the browser to show a new document.
To do this, the 
applet makes a call to the showDocument( url ) method of the 
<tt class=literal>AppletContext</tt>.  
You can get a reference to the <tt class=literal>AppletContext</tt> with
the Applet's <tt class=literal>getAppletContext()</tt> method. 
<tt class=literal>showDocument()</tt> can take an additional
<tt class=literal>String</tt> argument to tell the browser where to
display the new URL:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
getAppletContext().showDocument( url, name ); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>name</tt> argument can be the name of an
existing labeled HTML frame; the document referenced by the URL
will be displayed in that frame. You can use this method to create
an applet that "drives" the browser to new locations dynamically, but stays
active on the screen in a separate frame.
If the named frame doesn't exist, the browser will create
a new top-level window to hold it.  Alternatively, <tt class=literal>name</tt> can have one 
of the following special values:

<div class=informaltable>
<p>
<table class=INFORMALTABLE>
<tr class=row>
<td align="left">_self</TD>
<td align="left">Show in the current Frame</TD>
</TR>
<tr class=row>
<td align="left">_parent</TD>
<td align="left">Show in the parent of our Frame</TD>
</TR>
<tr class=row>
<td align="left">_top</TD>
<td align="left">Show in outer-most (top level) frame.</TD>
</TR>
<tr class=row>
<td align="left">_blank</TD>
<td align="left">Show in a new top level browser window.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Both <tt class=literal>showStatus()</tt> and 
<tt class=literal>showDocument()</tt>
requests may be ignored by a cold-hearted viewer or Web browser.

    *** Discuss getImage() and image loading from JAR files for applications ***

<p class=para>
The following list summarizes the methods of the applet API:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
// from the AppletStub
boolean isActive();
URL getDocumentBase();
URL getCodeBase();
String getParameter(String name);
AppletContext getAppletContext();
void appletResize(int width, int height);
// from the AppletContext
AudioClip getAudioClip(URL url);
Image getImage(URL url);
Applet getApplet(String name);
Enumeration getApplets();
void showDocument(URL url);
public void showDocument(URL url, String target);
void showStatus(String status);
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
These are the methods that are provided by the applet viewer
environment.  If your applet doesn't happen to use any of them, or if
you can provide alternatives to handle special cases (such as loading
images from JAR files), your applet could be made able to function as
a standalone application as well as an applet.  For example, our
<tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> applet from <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>A First Applet</i></A> was very
simple.  We can easily give it a <tt class=literal>main()</tt>
method to allow it to be run as a standalone application:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class HelloWeb extends Applet {
 
    public void paint( java.awt.Graphics gc ) {
        gc.drawString( "Hello Web!", 125, 95 );
    }
 
    public static void main( String [] args ) {
        Frame theFrame = new Frame();
        Applet helloWeb = new HelloWeb();
        theFrame.add("Center", helloWeb);
        theFrame.setSize(200,200);
        helloWeb.init();
        helloWeb.start();
        theFrame.show();
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Here we get to play "appletviewer" for a change. We have created an
instance of <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> using its constructor
- something we don't normally do$mdash;and added it to our own
<tt class=literal>Frame</tt>.  We call its
<tt class=literal>init()</tt> method to give the applet a chance
to wake up and then call its <tt class=literal>start()</tt>
method.  In this example, <tt class=literal>HelloWeb</tt> doesn't
implement these, <tt class=literal>init()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>start()</tt>, so we're calling methods
inherited from the <tt class=literal>Applet</tt> class.  This is
the procedure that an appletviewer would use to run an applet.  (If we
wanted to go further, we could implement our own
<tt class=literal>AppletContext</tt> and
<tt class=literal>AppletStub</tt>, and set them in the
<tt class=literal>Applet</tt> before startup).
<p class=para>
Trying to make your applets into applications as well often doesn't
make sense, and is not always trivial.
We show this only to get you thinking about the real differences 
between applets and applications.  
It is probably best to stay within the applet API
until you have a need to go outside it.  Remember that trusted applets
can do almost all of the things that applications can.  It is probably
wiser to make an applet that requires trusted permissions than an 
application.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-10-SECT-1.2">Events</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH10.EV1"></A>We've spent a lot of time discussing the different kinds of objects in
AWT--components, containers, and a few special containers like
applets. But we've neglected communications between different objects.
A few times, we've mentioned events, and we have even used them in the
occasional program (like our applets in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>A First Applet</i></A>), but we have
deferred a discussion of events until later. Now is the time to pay
that debt.

<p class=para>
AWT objects communicate by sending events.
The way we talk about "firing" events and "handling" them makes it sound
as if they are part of some special Java language feature.  But they aren't.
An event is simply an ordinary Java object that is delivered to its receiver
by invoking an ordinary Java method.  Everything else, however interesting,
is purely convention.  The entire Java event mechanism is really 
just a set of conventions for the kinds of descriptive objects that should 
be delivered; these conventions prescribe when, how, and to whom
events should be delivered. 

<p class=para>
Events are sent from a single source object to one or more listeners
(or "targets").
A listener implements specific event handling methods that enable it
to receive a
type of event.  It then registers itself with a source of that kind of event.
Sometimes there may be an "adapter" object interposed between the event 
source and the listener, but there is always a connection
established before any events are delivered. 

<p class=para>
An event object is a subclass of
<tt class=literal>java.util.EventObject</tt> that holds 
information about "something that's happened" to its source.  The
<tt class=literal>EventObject</tt> class serves mainly to
identify event objects;
the only information it contains is a reference to the event source
(the object that sent the event).
Components do not normally send or receive
<tt class=literal>EventObject</tt>s as such; they 
work with subclasses that provide more specific information.
<tt class=literal>AWTEvent</tt> is a subclass of
<tt class=literal>EventObject</tt> that is used within AWT;
further subclasses of <tt class=literal>AWTEvent</tt> provide
information about specific event types. 

<p class=para>
For example, events of type <tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt>
are fired by buttons
when they are pushed.  <tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt>s are
also sent when a menu item is selected 
or when a user presses ENTER in a <tt class=literal>TextField</tt>.
Similarly, <tt class=literal>MouseEvent</tt>s are generated when
you operate your mouse within a component's area.
You can gather the general meaning of these two events from their names;
they are relatively self-descriptive.
<tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt>s correspond to a decisive
"action" that a user has taken with the component--like pressing a
button, or pressing ENTER to indicate that he has filled in a text
field. An <tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt> thus carries the
name of an action to be performed (the "action command") by the program. 
<tt class=literal>MouseEvent</tt>s describe the state of the
mouse, and therefore carry information like the x and y coordinates
and the state of your mouse
buttons at the time it was created.
You might hear someone say that
<tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt> is at a "higher semantic level"
than <tt class=literal>MouseEvent</tt>. This means that
<tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt> is an interpretation of
something that happened and is, therefore, 
conceptually more powerful 
than the <tt class=literal>MouseEvent</tt>, which carries raw
data.  An <tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt> lets us know that a component
has done its job, while a <tt class=literal>MouseEvent</tt>
simply confers a lot of information about the mouse at a given time.
You could figure out that somebody clicked on a
<tt class=literal>Button</tt> by examining mouse events, but it
is simpler to work with action events.
The precise meaning of an event, however, can depend on the context in
which it is received.  (More on that in a moment.)

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.18">Event Receivers and Listener Interfaces</A></h4>

<p class=para>
An event is delivered by passing it as an argument to an event handler 
method in the receiving object.
<tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt>s, for example,
are always delivered to a method called
<tt class=literal>actionPerformed()</tt> in the receiver:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
// Receiver
public void actionPerformed( ActionEvent e ) {
    ...
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
For each type of event, there is a corresponding 
listener interface that describes the methods it must provide to receive
those events.
In this case, any object that receives
<tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt>s 
must implement the <tt class=literal>ActionListener</tt> interface:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public interface ActionListener extends java.util.EventListener {
    public void actionPerformed( ActionEvent e );
}
// Reciever implements ActionListener
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
All listener interfaces are subinterfaces of
<tt class=literal>java.util.EventListener</tt>, 
but <tt class=literal>EventListener</tt> is simply an empty
interface.  It exists only to help the compiler
identify listener interfaces.

<p class=para>
Listener interfaces are required for a number of reasons. First, they
help to identify objects that are capable of receiving a given 
type of event.  This way we can 
give the event handler methods friendly, 
descriptive names and still make it easy for documentation, tools, and
humans to recognize them in a class.  Next, listener interfaces are
useful because there can be several methods specified for an event receiver.
For example, the <tt class=literal>FocusListener</tt> interface
contains two methods:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
abstract void focusGained( FocusEvent e );
abstract void focusLost( FocusEvent e );
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Athough these methods both take a 
<tt class=literal>FocusEvent</tt> as an argument, they correspond
to different meanings for why the
event was fired; in this case, whether the
<tt class=literal>FocusEvent</tt> means that focus was 
received or lost. You could figure out what happened by inspecting the
event; all <tt class=literal>AWTEvent</tt>s contain a constant
specifying the event's subtype. By requiring two methods, the
<tt class=literal>FocusListener</tt> 
interface saves you the effort: if
<tt class=literal>focusGained()</tt> is called, you know the
event type was <tt class=literal>FOCUS_GAINED</tt>. Similarly,
the <tt class=literal>MouseListener</tt> interface defines five
methods for receiving mouse events (and
<tt class=literal>MouseMotionListener</tt> defines two more),
each of which gives you some additional information about why the
event occurred. In general, the listener interfaces group sets of
related event handler methods; the method called in any given
situation provides a context for the information in the event object.

<p class=para>
There can be more than one listener interface for dealing with a
particular kind of event.  For example, the 
<tt class=literal>MouseListener</tt> interface describes methods
for receiving <tt class=literal>MouseEvent</tt>s when the mouse 
enters or exits an area, or a mouse button is 
pressed or released.
<tt class=literal>MouseMotionListener</tt> is an entirely separate 
interface that describes methods to get mouse events when the mouse is
moved (no buttons pressed) or dragged (buttons pressed). By separating
mouse events into these two categories, Java lets you 
be a little more selective about the circumstances under which you want to 
recieve <tt class=literal>MouseEvent</tt>s. You can register as a
listener for mouse events without receiving mouse motion events; since
mouse motion events are extremely common, you don't want to handle
them if you don't need to. 

<p class=para>
Finally, we should point out two simple patterns in the 
naming of AWT event listener interfaces and handler methods:  

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Event handler methods are public methods that return type  
<tt class=literal>void</tt> and take a single event object (a
subclass of <tt class=literal>java.util.EventObject</tt> as an argument).[2]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
This rule is not complete.  The full Java Beans 
allows event handler methods to take additional arguments when absolutely
necessary and also to throw checked exceptions.
</blockquote>
<p>
<li class=listitem>Listener interfaces are subclasses of
<tt class=literal>java.util.EventListener</tt> 
that are named with the suffix "Listener," e.g., FooListener.

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
These may seem pretty obvious, but they are important because
they are our first hint of a <i class=emphasis>design pattern</I> governing
how to build components that work with events.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.19">Event Sources</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The previous section described the machinery that an event receiver uses
to accept events.  In this section we'll describe how the receiver
tells an event source to start sending it events as they occur.

<p class=para>
To receive events, an eligible listener must register itself with an 
event source.  It does this by 
calling an "add listener" method in the event source, and passing a
reference (a callback) to itself.
For example, the AWT <tt class=literal>Button</tt> class is a
source of <tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt>s. In order to
receive these events, our code 
might do something like the following:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
// source of ActionEvents
Button theButton = new Button("Belly");
   
// receiver of ActionEvents
class TheReceiver implements ActionListener {
   setupReceiver() {
      ...
      theButton.addActionListener( this );
   }
   public void actionPerformed( ActionEvent e ) {
      // Belly Button pushed...
   }
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The receiver makes a call to
<tt class=literal>addActionListener()</tt> to complete its 
setup and become eligible to receive
<tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt>s from the button when they
occur. 
It passes the reference <tt class=literal>this</tt>, to add
itself as the <tt class=literal>ActionListener</tt>.

<p class=para>
To manage its listeners, an <tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt>
source (like the <tt class=literal>Button</tt>) always implements  
two methods:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
// ActionEvent source
public void addActionListener(ActionListener listener) {
   ...
}
public void removeActionListener(ActionListener listener) {
   ...
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>removeActionListener()</tt> method
complements <tt class=literal>addActionListener()</tt> and 
does what you'd expect: it removes the listener from the list so that it will
not receive future events from that source.

<p class=para>
Now, you may be expecting an
"event source" interface listing these two methods, but there isn't
one.  There are no event source
interfaces in the current conventions.  
If you are analyzing a class and trying to determine what events it
generates, you have to look for the add and remove methods.
For example, the presence of the
<tt class=literal>addActionListener()</tt> and  
<tt class=literal>removeActionListener()</tt> methods define the
object as a source of <tt class=literal>ActionEvent</tt>s.
If you happen to be a human being, you can simply look at the 
documentation; but if the documentation isn't available, or if you're
writing a program that needs to analyze a class (a process called
"reflection"), you can look for this design pattern:
<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>A source of events for the FooListener interface must implement 
a pair of add/remove methods: 
	

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>	addFooListener(FooListener listener)  (*)
        

<p>
<li class=listitem>	removeFooListener(FooListener listener)
	

<p>
</UL>
<p>
<li class=listitem>If an event source can only support one event listener 
(unicast delivery), the add listener method can throw the checked exception
<tt class=literal>java.util.TooManyListenersException</tt>.

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
So, what do all the naming patterns up to this point accomplish?  Well, for one
thing they make it possible for automated tools and integrated development 
environments to divine what are sources and what are sinks of particular 
events.  Tools that work with Java Beans will use the Java 
reflection and introspection APIs to search for these kinds of design patterns
and identify the events that can be fired and received by a component.  

<p class=para>
It also means that event hookups are strongly typed, just like the 
rest of Java.  So, it's not easy to accidentally hook up the wrong kind of
components; for example, you can't register to receive
<tt class=literal>ItemEvent</tt>s from a
<tt class=literal>Button</tt>, because a button doesn't have an
<tt class=literal>addItemListener()</tt> method.  Java knows at
compile time what types of events can be delivered to whom.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.20">Event Delivery</A></h4>

<p class=para>
AWT events are multicast; every event is associated with 
a single source, but can be delivered to any number of receivers.
Events are registered and distributed using an observer/observable model.
When an event listener registers itself with an event source, the event 
source adds the listener to a list.  When an event is fired, it is delivered 
individually to each listener on the list.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-10-FIG-9">Figure 10.9: Event delivery</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je1009.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 10-9]" width=503 height=203 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
There are no guarantees about the order in which events will be 
delivered.  Neither are there any guarantees if you register yourself more 
than once with an event source; you may get the event more than once,
or not. Similarly, you should assume that every listener receives the
same event data. Events are "immutable"; they can't be changed by
their listeners. There's one important exception to this rule, which
we'll discuss later.

<p class=para>
To be complete we could say that event delivery is synchronous with respect
to the event source, but that follows from the fact 
that the event 
delivery is really just the invocation of a normal Java method.  
The source of the event calls the handler method of each listener.  
However, listeners shouldn't assume that all of the events will be sent in 
the same thread.  An event source could decide to sent out 
events to all of the listeners in parallel.

<p class=para>
How exactly an event source maintains its set of listeners, constructs,
and fires the events is up to it.  Often it is sufficient to use a
<tt class=literal>Vector</tt> 
to hold the list.  We'll show the code for a component that uses a 
custom event in <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, <i>Using and Creating GUI Components</i></A>.
For efficiency, AWT components all use the 
<tt class=literal>java.awt.AWTEventMulticaster</tt> object, which
maintains a linked tree of the 
listeners for the component.  You can use that too, if you are firing 
standard AWT events.  We'll describe the event multicaster in <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, <i>Using and Creating GUI Components</i></A>
as well. 

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.21">AWTEvents</A></h4>

<p class=para>
All of the events used by AWT GUI components are subclasses of 
<tt class=literal>java.awt.AWTEvent</tt>.
<tt class=literal>AWTEvent</tt> holds some 
common information that is used by AWT 
to identify and process events.  You can use or subclass any of the
<tt class=literal>AWTEvent</tt>  
types for use in your own components.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
Use the event hierarchy from Java in a Nutshell or AWT Reference.
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>ComponentEvent</tt> is the base class for
events that can be fired by any AWT 
component.  This includes events that provide notification when a component 
changes its dimensions or visibility, as well as the other event types for
mouse operation and key presses.
<tt class=literal>ContainerEvent</tt>s are fired by AWT
containers when components are added or removed.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.22">java.awt.event.InputEvent</A></h4>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>MouseEvent</tt>s, which track the state of the
mouse, and <tt class=literal>KeyEvent</tt>s, 
which are fired when the user uses the keyboard, are types of 
<tt class=literal>java.awt.event.InputEvent</tt>.  Input events from
the mouse and keyboard are  
a little bit special.  They are normally produced by the native Java machinery
associated with the peers.  When the user touches a key or moves the mouse 
within a component's area, the events are generated with that component as 
the source.

<p class=para>
Input events and some other AWT events are placed on a special event queue that
is managed by the AWT Toolkit.  This gives the Toolkit control over 
how the events are delivered.  First, under some circumstances, the Toolkit
can decide to "compress" a sequence of the same type of event into a
single event.  This is done to make some event types more
efficient--in particular, mouse events and some special internal
events used to control repainting.  Perhaps more important to us,
input events 
are delivered with a special arrangement that lets listeners decide
if the component itself should act on the event.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.23">Consuming events</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Normally, the native peer of a standard AWT component operates by 
receiving <tt class=literal>InputEvent</tt>s telling it about the
mouse and keyboard.  
When you push a <tt class=literal>Button</tt>, the native
<tt class=literal>ButtonPeer</tt> object receives a
<tt class=literal>MouseEvent</tt> 
and does its job in native land to accomplish the button-depressing behavior.
But for <tt class=literal>InputEvent</tt>s, the Toolkit first
delivers the event to any listeners 
registered with the the component and gives those listeners a chance to
mark the event as "consumed," effectively telling the peer to ignore it.
An <tt class=literal>InputEvent</tt> is marked "consumed" by
calling the <tt class=literal>consume()</tt> method.  (Yes, 
this is a case where an event is not treated as immutable.)

<p class=para>
So, we could stop our <tt class=literal>Button</tt> from working
by registering a listener with it 
that catches "mouse button depressed" events.  When it got one, we could 
call its <tt class=literal>consume()</tt> method to tell the
<tt class=literal>ButtonPeer</tt> to ignore that event. 
This is particularly useful if you happen to be building a develoment 
environment in Java and you want to "turn off" components while the user
arranges them.

<p class=para>
If you need to, in a trusted application you can get access to the AWT 
event queue.  The Toolkit uses an instance of
<tt class=literal>java.awt.EventQueue</tt>. 
With it you can peek at pending AWT events or even to push in new ones.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.24">Mouse and Key Modifiers on InputEvents</A></h4>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>InputEvent</tt>s come with a set of flags for
special modifiers.  These let you 
detect if the SHIFT or ALT key was held down during a mouse
button or key press, or if the second or third mouse buttons were
pressed.  The following are the flag values contained in 
<tt class=literal>java.awt.event.InputEvent</tt>:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>SHIFT_MASK

<p>
<li class=listitem>CTRL_MASK

<p>
<li class=listitem>META_MASK

<p>
<li class=listitem>ALT_MASK

<p>
<li class=listitem>BUTTON1_MASK

<p>
<li class=listitem>BUTTON2_MASK

<p>
<li class=listitem>BUTTON3_MASK

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
To check for these masks, you can simply do a boolean AND of the modifiers,
returned by the <tt class=literal>InputEvent</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>getModifiers()</tt> method and the flag or
flags you're interested in:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public void mousePressed (MouseEvent e) {
    int mods = e.getModifiers();
    if ((mods &amp; InputEvent.SHIFT_MASK) != 0)
        // Shifted Mouse Button press
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In the list you'll notice there are three BUTTON flags.  These can be
used to detect if a particular mouse button was used in a mouse press on a 
two or three button mouse.  Be warned, if you use these you run the
risk that your program won't work on platforms without multibutton
mice. Currently, BUTTON2_MASK is equivalent to ALT_MASK, and
BUTTON3_MASK is equivalent to META_MASK. This means that pushing the
second mouse button is equivalent to pressing the first (or only)
button with the ALT key depressed, and the third button is equivalent
to the first with the META key depressed. However, if you really want
to guarantee portability, you should limit yourself to a single
button, possibly in combination with keyboard modifiers, rather than
relying on the button masks.

<p class=para>
Key events provide one other situation in which events aren't
immutable. You can change the character that the user typed by calling
<tt class=literal>setKeyChar()</tt>,
<tt class=literal>setKeyCode()</tt>, or
<tt class=literal>setKeyModifiers()</tt>. A user's keystroke
isn't displayed until the <tt class=literal>KeyEvent</tt> is
delivered to the peer. Therefore, by changing the character in the
<tt class=literal>KeyEvent</tt>, you can change the character
displayed on the screen.  This is a good way to implement a field that
only displays uppercase characters, regardless of what the user types.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT2-AUTOID.4">Adapter Classes</A></h3>

<p class=para>
It's not ideal to have your application components implement a
listener interface and receive events directly.  Sometimes it's not even 
possible.  Being an event receiver forces you to 
modify or subclass your objects to implement the appropriate event
listener interfaces and add the code necessary to handle the events.  A more
subtle issue is that, since we are talking about AWT events here,
you are, of necessity, building GUI logic into parts of your application
that shouldn't have to know anything about the GUI.
Let's look at an example:

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-10-FIG-10">Figure 10.10: Implementing the ActionListener interface</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je1010.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 10-10]" width=503 height=132 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
In <a href="#EXJ-CH-10-FIG-10">Figure 10.10</A> we have drawn the plans for our Vegomatic food processor.
Here we have made our Vegomatic object implement the
<tt class=literal>ActionListener</tt> interface
so that it can receive events directly from the three
<tt class=literal>Button</tt> components:
"Chop," "Puree," and "Frappe."  The problem is that our Vegomatic object
now has to know more than how to mangle food.  It also has to be
aware that it will be driven by three controls, specifically buttons that 
send action commands, and be aware of which methods in itself it should invoke for those
commands.  Our boxes labeling the GUI and Application code overlap in an
unwholesome way.  If the marketing people should later want to add or
remove buttons, or perhaps just change the names, we have to be
careful. We may have to modify the logic in our Vegomatic Object.  All
is not well.

<p class=para>
An alternative is to place an "adapter" class between our event source and
receiver.  An adapter is a simple object whose sole purpose is to map an 
incoming event to an outgoing method.  

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-10-FIG-11">Figure 10.11: A design using adapter classes</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je1011.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 10-11]" width=503 height=163 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
<a href="#EXJ-CH-10-FIG-11">Figure 10.11</A> shows a better design that uses three adapter classes, one
for each button.  The implementation of the first adapter might look like:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class VegomaticAdapter1 implements actionListener {
    Vegotmatic vegomatic;
    VegomaticAdapter1 ( Vegotmatic vegomatic ) {
        this.vegomatic = vegomatic;
    }
    public void actionPerformed( ActionEvent e ) {
        vegomatic.chopFood();
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
So somewhere in the code where we build our GUI, we could register our
listener like so:

<div class=screen>

Vegomatic theVegomatic = ...;

<p class=para>
We have completely separated the messiness of our GUI from the application
code.  However, we have added three new classes to our application,
none of which does very much.  Is that good?  That depends on your
vantage point. 

<p class=para>
Under different circumstances our buttons may have been able to share
a common adapter class that was simply instantiated with different
parameters.  There are various trade-off that can be made between
size, efficiency, and elegance of code.  Often, adapter classes will
be generated automatically by development tools.  The way we have
named our adapter classes "VegomaticAdapter1," "VegomaticAdapter2,"
and "VegomaticAdapter3" hints at this.  More often, when hand coding,
you'll use an inner 
class. At the other extreme, we can forsake Java's strong typing and
use the reflection API to create a completely dynamic hookup betwen an
event source and listener.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.27">AWT Dummy Adapters</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Many listener interfaces contain more than one event handler method.
Unfortunately, this means that to register yourself as interested in any
one of those events, you must implement the whole listener interface.  
And to accomplish this you might find yourself typing in dummy 
"stubbed out" methods, simply to complete the interface.  There is really 
nothing wrong with this, but it is a bit tedious.
To save you some trouble, AWT provides some helper classes that
implement these dummy methods for you.  
For each listener interface containing more than one method there is
an adapter class containing the stubbed methods.  The adapter class
serves as a base class for your own adapters.
So, when you need a class to patch together your event source and listener, 
you can simply subclass the adapter and override only the methods you want.

<p class=para>
For example, the <tt class=literal>MouseAdapter</tt> class
implements the <tt class=literal>MouseListener</tt> interface 
and provides the following implementation:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {};
public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {};
public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {};
public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {};
public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {};
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This may not look like a tremendous time saver, and you're right.  It's
simply a bit of sugar.  The primary advantage comes into play when we use 
the <tt class=literal>MouseAdapter</tt> as the base for your own
adapter in an anonymous inner class. 
For example, suppose we want to catch a
<tt class=literal>mousePressed()</tt> event in some component 
and blow up a building.  We can use the following to make the hookup:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
someComponent.addMouseListener( new MouseAdapter() {
    public void MousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
        building.blowUp();
    }
} );
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
We've taken artistic liberties with the formatting, but I think it's very 
readable, and I like it.
It's a common enough activity that it's nice to avoid typing those extra
few lines and perhaps stave off the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome for 
a few more hours.  Remember that any time you use an inner class, the 
compiler is generating a class for you, so the messiness you've saved in
your source still exists in the output classes.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT2-AUTOID.5">Old Style and New Style Event Processing</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Although Java is still a youngster, it has a bit of a legacy.  Versions of
Java before 1.1 used a different style of event delivery.  Back in the
old days (a few months ago) event types were
limited and events were only delivered to the
<tt class=literal>Component</tt> that generated it, or
one of its parent containers.  The old style component event handler
methods (now deprecated) returned a boolean 
value declaring whether or not they had "handled" the event. 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
boolean handleEvent( Event e ) {
    ...
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If the method returns false, the 
event is automatically redelivered to the component's container to give it a 
chance.  If the container does not handle it, it is passed on to its parent
container and so on.  
In this way, events were propogated up the containment hierarchy 
until they were either consumed or
passed over to the component peer, just as current
<tt class=literal>InputEvent</tt>s are ultimately 
interpreted used the peer if no registered event listeners have
consumed them. 

<p class=para>
Although this style of event delivery was convenient for some simple 
applications, it is not very flexible.  Events could only be handled by 
components, which meant that you always had to subclass a
<tt class=literal>Component</tt> or
<tt class=literal>Container</tt> type to handle events.  This was
a degenerate use of inheritance 
(bad design) that led to the creation of lots of unnecessary classes.

<p class=para>
We could, alternatively, receive the events for many embedded components 
in a single parent container, but that would often lead to very convoluted 
logic in the container's event handling methods.
It is also very costly to run 
every single AWT event through a guantlet of (often empty) tests as it 
traverses its way up the tree of containers.  
This is why Java now provides the more
dynamic and general event source/listener model that we have described in
this chapter.  
The old style events and event handler methods are, however, still with us.

<p class=para>
Java is not allowed to simply change and break an established API.  Instead,
as we described in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, <i>Yet Another Language?</i></A>, older ways of doing things are simply 
"deprecated"
in favor of the new ones.  This means that code using the old style event
handler methods will still work; you may see old-style code 
around for a long time.  The problem with relying on old-style
event delivery, however, is that the old and new ways of doing
things cannot be mixed.

<p class=para>
By default, Java is obligated to perform the old behavior--offering events
to the component and each of its parent containers.  However, Java turns off
the old style delivery whenever it thinks that we have elected to use the new 
style.  
Java determines whether a <tt class=literal>Component</tt> should
recieve old style 
or new style events based on whether any event listeners are registered, or
whether new style events have been explicitly enabled.
When an AWT event listener is registered with a
<tt class=literal>Component</tt>, new style events
are implicitly turned on (a flag is set).   
Additionally, a mask is set telling the component the types of AWT events 
it should process.
The mask allows components to be more selective about which events
they process.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.28">processEvent()</A></h4>

<p class=para>
When new style events are enabled, all events are first routed to the 
<tt class=literal>dispatchEvent()</tt> method of the
<tt class=literal>Component</tt> class.  The 
<tt class=literal>dispatchEvent()</tt> method examines the
component's event
mask and decides whether the event 
should be processed or ignored.  Events that have been "enabled" are 
sent to the <tt class=literal>processEvent()</tt> method, which
simply looks at the event's type 
and delegates it to a "helper" processing method named for its type.  
The helper processing method finally dispatches the event to the set of 
registered listeners for its type.

<p class=para>
 
This process closely parallels the way in which old style events are 
processed, and the way in which events are first directed to a single
<tt class=literal>handleEvent()</tt> 
method that dispatches them to more specific handler methods in the
<tt class=literal>Component</tt> class.  The differences are that
new style events are not delivered 
unless someone is listening for them, and the listener registration mechanism
means that we don't have to subclass the component in order to override its
event handler methods and insert our own code.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="ch10-SECT3-AUTOID.29">Enabling New Style Events Explicitly</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Still, if you are subclassing a <tt class=literal>Component</tt>
type for other reasons, or you 
really want to process all events in a single method, you should
be aware that it is possible to emulate the old style event handling
and override your component's event processing methods.  You simply have to 
call the <tt class=literal>Component</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>enableEvents()</tt> method with the appropriate 
mask value to turn on processing for the given type of event.  You can then
override the corresponding method and insert your code.
The mask values are found in the
<tt class=literal>java.awt.AWTEvent</tt> class:

<div class=informaltable>
<p>
<table class=INFORMALTABLE>
<tr class=row>
<th align="left">java.awt.AWTEvent mask</TH>
<th align="left">method</TH>
</TR>
<tr class=row>
<td align="left">COMPONENT_EVENT_MASK</TD>
<td align="left">processComponentEvent()</TD>
</TR>
<tr class=row>
<td align="left">FOCUS_EVENT_MASK</TD>
<td align="left">processFocusEvent()</TD>
</TR>
<tr class=row>
<td align="left">KEY_EVENT_MASK</TD>
<td align="left">processKeyEvent()</TD>
</TR>
<tr class=row>
<td align="left">MOUSE_EVENT_MASK</TD>
<td align="left">processMouseEvent()</TD>
</TR>
<tr class=row>
<td align="left">MOUSE_MOTION_EVENT_MASK</TD>
<td align="left">processMouseMotionEvent()</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
    public void init() {
        ...
        enableEvent( AWTEvent.KEY_EVENT_MASK ):
    }
    public void processKeyEvent(KeyEvent e) {
        if ( e.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED )
            // do work
        super.processKeyEvent(e);
    }
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If you do this it is vital that you remember to make a call to 
<tt class=literal>super.process...Event()</tt> in order to allow
normal event delegation to continue. Of course, by emulating old-style
event handling, we're giving up the virtues of the new style; in
particular, this code is a lot less flexible than the code we could
write with the new event model. As we've seen, the user interface is
hopelessly tangled with the actual work your program does. 
A compromise solution would be to have your subclass declare that it
implements the appropriate listener interface and register itself, as we have
done in the simpler examples in this book:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class MyApplet implements KeyListener ...
        
    public void init() {
        addKeyListener( this ):
        ...
    }
    public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {
        // do work
    }
</PRE>
</DIV>
