<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.OBJ"></A>In this chapter, we'll get to the heart of Java and
explore the object-oriented aspects of the language. Object-oriented
design is the art of decomposing an application into some number of
objects--self-contained application components that work
together. The goal is to break the problem down into a number of
smaller problems that are simpler and easier to understand. Ideally,
the components can be implemented directly as objects in the Java
language. And if things are truly ideal, the components correspond to
well-known objects that already exist, so they don't have to be
created at all.

<p class=para>
An object design methodology is a system or a set of
rules created by someone to help you identify objects in your
application domain and pick the real ones from the noise. In other
words, such a methodology helps you factor your application into a
good set of reusable objects. The problem is that though it wants to
be a science, good object-oriented design is still pretty much an art
form. While you can learn from the various off-the-shelf design
methodologies, none of them will help you in all situations. The truth
is that experience pays.

<p class=para>
I won't try to push you into a particular methodology
here; there are shelves full of books to do that.[1]
Instead, I'll provide a few hints to get you started. Here are some
general design guidelines, which should be taken with a liberal amount
of salt and common sense:

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
Once you have some experience with basic object-oriented concepts, you
might want to take a look at <i class=citetitle>Design Patterns: Elements of
Reusable Object Oriented Software</i> by
Gamma/Helm/Johnson/Vlissides (Addison-Wesley). This book catalogs useful
object-oriented designs that have been refined over the years by
experience. Many appear in the design of the Java
APIs.
</blockquote>
<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Think of an object in terms of its interface, not its
implementation. It's perfectly fine for an object's internals to
be unfathomably complex, as long as its "public face" is easy to
understand.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Hide and abstract as much of your implementation as possible. Avoid
public variables in your objects, with the possible exception of
constants.  Instead define "accessor" methods to set and return values 
(even if they are simple types). Later, when you need to, you'll be able to 
modify and extend the behavior of your objects without breaking other classes 
that rely on them.  

<p>
<li class=listitem>Specialize objects only when you have to. When you use an object in
its existing form, as a piece of a new object, you are composing
objects. When you change or refine the behavior of an object, you are
using inheritance. You should try to reuse objects by composition
rather than inheritance whenever possible because when you compose
objects you are taking full advantage of existing tools. Inheritance
involves breaking down the barrier of an object and should be
done only when there's a real advantage. Ask yourself if you really need to
inherit the whole public interface of an object (do you want to be a "kind"
of that object), or if you can just delegate certain jobs to the object and 
use it by composition.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Minimize relationships between objects and try to organize related objects in
packages. To enhance your code's reusability, write it as if there
<i class=emphasis>is</I> a tomorrow. Find what one object needs to know
about another to get its job done and try to minimize the coupling
between them.

<p>

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-1">5.1 Classes</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.CLASS"></A>Classes are the building blocks of a Java application. A
<i class=emphasis>class</I> can contain methods, variables,
initialization code, and, as we'll discuss later on, even other
classes.  It serves as a blueprint for making class
<i class=emphasis>instances</I>, which are run-time objects that
implement the class structure. You declare a class with the
<tt class=literal>class</tt> keyword. Methods and variables of the class
appear inside the braces of the class declaration:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Pendulum { 
    float mass;  
    float length = 1.0; 
    int cycles; 
 
    float position ( float time ) { 
        ... 
    } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The above class, <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt>, contains three
variables: <tt class=literal>mass</tt>, <tt class=literal>length</tt>, and
<tt class=literal>cycles</tt>. It also defines a method called
<tt class=literal>position()</tt> that takes a <tt class=literal>float</tt>
value as an argument and returns a <tt class=literal>float</tt>
value. Variables and method declarations can appear in any order, but
variable initializers can't use forward references to uninitialized
variables.

<p class=para>
Once we've defined the <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt>
class, we can create a <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> object 
(an instance of that class) as follows:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Pendulum p; 
p = new Pendulum(); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Recall that our declaration of the variable <tt class=literal>p</tt> does
not create a <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> object; it simply creates a
variable that refers to an object of type <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt>.
We still have to create the object dynamically, using the
<tt class=literal>new</tt> keyword. Now that we've created a
<tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> object, we can access its variables and
methods, as we've already seen many times:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
p.mass = 5.0; 
float pos = p.position( 1.0 ); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Variables defined in a class are called <i class=emphasis>instance
variables</I>. Every object has its own set of instance
variables; the values of these variables in one object can differ from
the values in another object, as shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-5-FIG-1">Figure 5.1</A>. 
If you don't initialize an instance
variable when you declare it, it's given a default value appropriate
for its type.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-FIG-1">Figure 5.1: Instances of the Pendulum class</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0501.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-1]" width=503 height=293 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
In <a href="#EXJ-CH-5-FIG-1">Figure 5.1</A>, we have a hypothetical
<tt class=literal>TextBook</tt> application that uses two instances of
<tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> through the reference type variables
<tt class=literal>bigPendulum</tt> and
<tt class=literal>smallPendulum</tt>. Each of these
<tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> objects has its own copy of
<tt class=literal>mass</tt>, <tt class=literal>length</tt>, and
<tt class=literal>cycles</tt>.

<p class=para>
As with variables, methods defined in a class are <i class=emphasis>instance
methods</I>. An instance method is associated with an instance
of the class, but each instance doesn't really have its own copy of
the method. Instead, there's just one copy of the method, but it
operates on the values of the instance variables of a particular
object. As you'll see later when we talk about subclassing, there's
more to learn about method selection.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-1.1">Accessing Members</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.ACCESS"></A>Inside of a class, we can access instance variables and call instance methods 
of the class directly by name. Here's an example that expands upon 
our <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt>: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Pendulum { 
    ... 
    void resetEverything() { 
        cycles = 0; 
        mass = 1.0; 
        ... 
        float startingPosition = position( 0.0 ); 
    } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Other classes generally access members of an object through a reference, 
using the C-style dot notation: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class TextBook { 
    ... 
    void showPendulum() { 
        Pendulum bob = new Pendulum(); 
        ... 
        int i = bob.cycles; 
        bob.resetEverything(); 
        bob.mass = 1.01; 
        ... 
    } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Here we have created a second class, <tt class=literal>TextBook</tt>, that
uses a <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> object. It creates an instance in
<tt class=literal>showPendulum()</tt> and then invokes methods and
accesses variables of the object through the reference
<tt class=literal>bob</tt>.

<p class=para>
Several factors affect whether class members can be accessed
from outside the class. You can use the visibility modifiers,
<tt class=literal>public</tt>, <tt class=literal>private</tt>, and
<tt class=literal>protected</tt> to restrict access; classes
can also be placed into packages that affect their scope. The
<tt class=literal>private</tt> modifier, for example, designates a variable
or method for use only by other members inside the class itself. In
the previous example, we could change the declaration of our variable
<tt class=literal>cycles</tt> to <tt class=literal>private</tt>:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Pendulum { 
    ... 
    private int cycles; 
    ... 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Now we can't access <tt class=literal>cycles</tt> from
<tt class=literal>TextBook</tt>:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class TextBook { 
    ... 
    void showPendulum() { 
        ... 
        int i = bob.cycles;         // Compile time error 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If we need to access cycles, we might add a 
<tt class=literal>getCycles()</tt> method to the <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt>
class. We'll look at access modifiers and how they affect the
scope of variables and methods in detail later.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-SECT-1.2">Static Members</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.STAT1"></A><a name="CH05.STAT2"></A><a name="CH05.STAT3"></A><a name="CH05.STAT4"></A><a name="CH05.STAT5"></A>Instance variables and methods are associated with and accessed
through a particular object. In contrast, members that are declared
with the <tt class=literal>static</tt> modifier live in the class and are
shared by all instances of the class. Variables declared with the
<tt class=literal>static</tt> modifier are called <i class=emphasis>static
variables</I> or <i class=emphasis>class variables</I>&nbsp;;
similarly, these kinds of methods are called <i class=emphasis>static
methods</I> or <i class=emphasis>class methods</I>.

<p class=para>
We can add a static variable to our <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> example: 

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Pendulum { 
    ... 
    static float gravAccel = 9.80; 
    ... 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
We have declared the new <tt class=literal>float</tt> variable
<tt class=literal>gravAccel</tt> as <tt class=literal>static</tt>. That means
if we change its value in any instance of a
<tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt>, the value changes for all
<tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> objects, as shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-5-FIG-2">Figure 5.2</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-5-FIG-2">Figure 5.2: A static variable</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0502.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-2]" width=503 height=332 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Static members can be accessed like instance members. Inside
our <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> class, we can refer to
<tt class=literal>gravAccel</tt> by name, like an instance variable:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Pendulum { 
    ... 
    float getWeight () { 
        return mass * gravAccel; 
    } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
However, since static members exist in the class itself, independent
of any instance, we can also access them directly through the
class. We don't need a <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> object to set
the variable <tt class=literal>gravAccel</tt>; instead we can use the
class name as a reference:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Pendulum.gravAccel = 8.76; 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This changes the value of <tt class=literal>gravAccel</tt> for any current
or future instances. Why, you may be wondering, would we want to
change the value of <tt class=literal>gravAccel</tt>? Well, perhaps we
want to explore how pendulums would work on different planets. Static
variables are also very useful for other kinds of data shared among classes
at run-time.  For instance you can create methods to register your objects
so that they can communicate or you can count references to them.

<p class=para>
We can use static variables to define constant values. In this
case, we use the <tt class=literal>static</tt> modifier along with the
<tt class=literal>final</tt> modifier. So, if we cared only about
pendulums under the influence of the Earth's gravitational pull,
we could change <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> as follows:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Pendulum { 
    ... 
    static final float EARTH_G = 9.80; 
    ... 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
We have followed a common convention and named our constant with
capital letters; C programmers should recognize the capitalization
convention, which resembles C <tt class=literal>#define</tt>
statements. Now the value of <tt class=literal>EARTH_G</tt> is a
constant; it can be accessed by any instance of
<tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> (or anywhere, for that matter), but its
value can't be changed at run-time. 

<p class=para>
It's important to use the combination of static and final only for things
that are really constant.  That's because, unlike other kinds of variable
references, the compiler is allowed to "inline" those values within classes
that reference them.  This is probably OK for things like PI, which aren't
likely to change for a while, but may not be ideal for other kinds of 
identifiers, such as we'll discuss below.

<p class=para>
<p class=para>
Static members are useful as flags and identifiers, which can be
accessed from anywhere. These are especially useful for values needed in the
construction of an instance itself. In our example, we might declare a
number of static values to represent various kinds of
<tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> objects:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Pendulum { 
    ... 
    static int SIMPLE = 0, ONE_SPRING = 1, TWO_SPRING = 2; 
    ... 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
We might then use these flags in a method that sets the type of a
<tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> or, more likely, in a special constructor,
as we'll discuss shortly:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Pendulum pendy = new Pendulum(); 
pendy.setType( Pendulum.ONE_SPRING ); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Remember, inside the <tt class=literal>Pendulum</tt> class, we can use
static members directly by name as well:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Pendulum { 
    ... 
    void resetEverything() { 
        setType ( SIMPLE ); 
        ... 
    } 
    ... 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>
