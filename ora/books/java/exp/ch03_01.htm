<p class=para>
As I described at the end of <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, <i>Yet Another Language?</i></A>, by now
you should have a number of options for Java development
environments. The examples in this book were developed using the
Solaris version of the Java Development Kit (JDK),
so I'm going to describe those tools here. When I refer to the
compiler or interpreter, I'll be referring to the command-line
versions of these tools, so the book is decidedly biased toward those
of you who are working in a UNIX or
DOS-like environment with a shell and filesystem.
However, the basic features I'll be describing for
Sun's Java interpreter and compiler should be applicable to
other Java environments as well.

<p class=para>
In this chapter, I'll describe the tools you'll need
to compile and run Java applications. I'll also cover the
HTML <tt class=literal>&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag and other
information you'll need to know to incorporate Java applets
in your Web pages.

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-3-SECT-1">3.1 The Java Interpreter</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH03.INTERPRET"></A>A Java interpreter is software that implements the Java virtual
machine and runs Java applications. It can be a separate piece
of software like the one that comes with the JDK,
or part of a larger application like the Netscape Navigator Web
browser. It's likely that the interpreter itself is written in a
native, compiled language for your particular platform. Other tools,
like Java compilers and development environments, can (and one could
argue, should) be written in Java.

<p class=para>
The Java interpreter performs all of the activities of the Java
run-time system. It loads Java class files and interprets the compiled
byte-code. It verifies compiled classes that are loaded from
untrusted sources by applying the rules discussed in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, <i>Yet Another Language?</i></A>. In an implementation that supports dynamic, or
"just in time," compilation, the interpreter also serves
as a specialized compiler that turns Java byte-code into native
machine instructions.

<p class=para>
Throughout the rest of this book, we'll be building both
standalone Java programs and applets. Both are kinds of Java
applications run by a Java interpreter. The difference is that a
standalone Java application has all of its parts; it's a complete
program that runs independently. An applet, as I described in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, <i>Yet Another Language?</i></A>, is more like an embeddable program module; it
relies on an applet viewer for support. Although Java applets are, of
course, compiled Java code, the Java interpreter can't directly run
them because they are used as part of a larger application. An
applet-viewer application could be a Web browser like Sun's
HotJava or Netscape Navigator, or a separate applet viewer application
like the one that comes with Sun's Java Development Kit. All of
Sun's tools, including HotJava, are written entirely in
Java. Both HotJava and the applet viewer are standalone Java
applications run directly by the Java interpreter; these programs
implement the additional structure needed to run Java applets.

<p class=para>
Sun's Java interpreter is called <i class=command>java</i>. 
To start a standalone application with it, you specify an initial class 
to be loaded. You can also specify options to the interpreter, as well 
as any command-line arguments that are needed for the application: 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
% java [<tt class=replaceable><i>interpreter options</i></tt>] <tt class=replaceable><i>class name</i></tt> [<tt class=replaceable><i>program arguments</i></tt>] 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The class should be specified as a fully qualified class name
including the class package, if any. Note, however, that you
don't include the <i class=filename>.class</i> file
extension. Here are a few examples:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
% java animals.birds.BigBird
% java test
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<i class=command>java</i> searches for the class in the current 
<i class=emphasis>class path</I>, which is a list of locations where 
packages of classes are stored. I'll discuss the class path in detail 
in the next section, but for now you should know that you can set the class 
path with the <tt class=literal>-classpath</tt> option. 

<p class=para>
There are a few other interpreter options you may find useful. The 
<tt class=literal>-cs</tt> or <tt class=literal>-checksource</tt> 
option tells <i class=command>java</i> to check the modification 
times on the specified class file and its corresponding source file. If 
the class file is out of date, it's automatically recompiled from the 
source. The <tt class=literal>-verify</tt>, <tt class=literal>-noverify</tt>, 
and <tt class=literal>-verifyremote</tt> options control the byte-code 
verification process. By default, <i class=command>java</i> runs 
the byte-code verifier only on classes loaded from an untrusted source; 
this is the <tt class=literal>-verifyremote</tt> option. If you specify 
<tt class=literal>-verify</tt>, the byte-code verifier is run on all 
classes; <tt class=literal>-noverify</tt> means that the verifier is 
never run. 

<p class=para>
Once the class is loaded, <i class=command>java</i> follows a
very C-like convention and looks to see if the class contains a method
called <tt class=literal>main()</tt>. If it finds an appropriate
<tt class=literal>main()</tt>method, the interpreter starts the
application by executing that method. From there, the application can
start additional threads, reference other classes, and create its user
interface or other structures, as shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-3-FIG-1">Figure 3.1</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-3-FIG-1">Figure 3.1: The Java interpreter starting a Java application</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0301.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 3-1]" width=503 height=175 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
In order to run, <tt class=literal>main()</tt> must have the
right <i class=emphasis>method signature</I>. A method signature is a
collection of information about the method, as in a C prototype or a
forward function declaration in other languages. It includes the
method's name, type, and visibility, as well as its arguments
and return type. In this case, <tt class=literal>main()</tt> must be a
<tt class=literal>public</tt>, <tt class=literal>static</tt> method that takes
an array of <tt class=literal>String</tt> objects as its argument and does
not return any value (<tt class=literal>void</tt>):

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public static void main ( String [] myArgs ) 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Because <tt class=literal>main()</tt> is a <tt class=literal>public</tt> 
method, it can be accessed directly from any other class using the name 
of the class that contains it. We'll discuss the implications of 
visibility modifiers such as <tt class=literal>public</tt> in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, <i>Objects in Java</i></A>. 

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method's single argument,
the array of <tt class=literal>String</tt> objects, holds the command-line
arguments passed to <i class=command>java</i>. As in C, the name that
we give the parameter doesn't matter, only the type is
important. Unlike C, the content of <tt class=literal>myArgs</tt> is a
true array. There's no need for an argument count parameter, because
<tt class=literal>myArgs</tt> knows how many arguments it contains and can
happily provide that information:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
int argc = myArgs.length; 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Java also differs from C in another respect here:
<tt class=literal>myArgs[0]</tt>is the first command-line argument, not
the name of the application. If you're accustomed to parsing C
command-line arguments, you'll need to be careful not to trip
over this difference.

<p class=para>
The Java virtual machine continues to run until the
<tt class=literal>main()</tt>method of its initial class file has returned,
and until any threads that it started are complete. Special threads
designated as "daemon" threads are silently killed when
the rest of the application has completed.
