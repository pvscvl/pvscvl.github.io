<a name="CH06.THREADS"></A>Threads have been around for some time, but few programmers have
actually worked with them. There is even some debate over whether or
not the average programmer can use threads effectively. In Java,
working with threads can be easy and productive. In fact, threads
provide the only way to effectively handle a number of tasks. So
it's important that you become familiar with threads early in
your exploration of Java.

<p class=para>
Threads are integral to the way Java works. We've already seen
that an applet's <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method isn't
called by the applet itself, but by another thread within the
interpreter. At any given time, there may be many such background
threads, performing activities in parallel with your application. In
fact, it's easy to get a half dozen or more threads running in
an applet without even trying, simply by requesting images, updating
the screen, playing audio, and so on. But these things happen behind
the scenes; you don't normally have to worry about them. In this
chapter, we'll talk about writing applications that create and
use their own threads explicitly.

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-6-SECT-1">6.1 Introducing Threads</A></h2>

<p class=para>
Conceptually, a thread is a flow of control within a program. A thread
is similar to the more familiar notion of a process, except that
multiple threads within the same application share much of the same
state--in particular, they run in the same address
space. It's not unlike a golf course, which can be used by many
players at the same time. Sharing the same address space means that
threads share instance variables, but not local variables, just like
players share the golf course, but not personal things like clubs and
balls.

<p class=para>
Multiple threads in an application have the same problems as the
players sharing a golf course: in a word, synchronization. Just as you
can't have two sets of players blindly playing the same green at
the same time, you can't have several threads trying to access
the same variables without some kind of coordination. Someone is
bound to get hurt. A thread can reserve the right to use an object
until it's finished with its task, just as a golf party gets
exclusive rights to the green until it's done. And a thread that
is more important can raise its priority, asserting its right to play
through.

<p class=para>
The devil is in the details, or course, and those details have
historically made threads difficult to use. Java makes creating,
controlling, and coordinating threads simple. When creating a new
thread is the best way to accomplish some task, it should be as easy
as adding a new component to your application.

<p class=para>
It is common to stumble over threads when you first look at them,
because creating a thread exercises many of your new Java skills all
at once. You can avoid confusion by remembering there are always
two players involved in running a thread: a Java language object that
represents the thread itself and an arbitrary target object that
contains the method the thread is to execute. Later, you will see that
it is possible to play some sleight of hand and combine these two
roles, but that special case just changes the packaging, not the
relationship.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-6-SECT-1.1">The Thread Class and the Runnable Interface</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH06.RUNNABLE1"></A><a name="CH06.RUNNABLE2"></A>A new thread is born when we create an instance of the
<tt class=literal>java.lang.Thread</tt> class. The
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt> object represents a real thread in the Java
interpreter and serves as a handle for controlling and synchronizing
its execution. With it, we can start the thread, stop the thread, or
suspend it temporarily. The constructor for the
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt> class accepts information about where the
thread should begin its execution. Conceptually, we would like to
simply tell it what method to run, but since there are no pointers to
methods in Java, we can't specify one directly. Instead, we have
to take a short detour and use the <tt class=literal>Runnable</tt>
interface to create an object that contains a "runnable"
method.

<p class=para>
An object that wants to serve as the target of a
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt> can declare that it has an appropriate
executable method by implementing the
<tt class=literal>java.lang.Runnable</tt>
interface. <tt class=literal>Runnable</tt> defines a single,
general-purpose method:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
public interface Runnable { 
  abstract public void run(); 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Every thread begins its life by executing a <tt class=literal>run()</tt>
method in a particular object. <tt class=literal>run()</tt> is a rather
mundane method that can hold an arbitrary body of code. It is
<tt class=literal>public</tt>, takes no arguments, has no return value,
and is not allowed to throw any exceptions.

<p class=para>
Any class can contain an appropriate <tt class=literal>run()</tt> method,
simply by declaring that it implements the <tt class=literal>Runnable</tt>
interface. An instance of this class is then a runnable object that
can serve as the target of a new <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>. In this
way, we can effectively run a method in any object we want.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-6-SECT-1.1.1">Creating and starting threads</A></h4>

<p class=para>
A newly born <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> remains idle until we give it a
figurative slap on the bottom by calling its
<tt class=literal>start()</tt> method. The thread then wakes up and
proceeds to execute the <tt class=literal>run()</tt> method of its target
object. <tt class=literal>start()</tt> can be called only once in the
lifetime of a <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>. Once a thread starts, it
continues running until the target object's
<tt class=literal>run()</tt> method completes, or we call the
thread's <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> method to kill the thread
permanently. A little later, we will look at some other methods
you can use to control the thread's progress while it is running.

<p class=para>
Now let's look at an example. The following class,
<tt class=literal>Animation</tt>, implements a <tt class=literal>run()</tt>
method to drive its drawing loop:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Animation implements Runnable { 
   ... 
   public void run() { 
 
       while ( true ) { 
           // Draw Frames 
           ... 
           repaint(); 
       } 
   } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
To use it, we create a <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> object with an
instance of <tt class=literal>Animation</tt> as its target object, and
invoke its <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method. We can perform these
steps explicitly, as in the following:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Animation happy = new Animation("Mr. Happy"); 
Thread myThread = new Thread( happy ); 
myThread.start(); 
... 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Here we have created an instance of our <tt class=literal>Animation</tt>
class and passed it as the argument to the constructor for
<tt class=literal>myThread</tt>. When we call the
<tt class=literal>start()</tt> method, <tt class=literal>myThread</tt> begins
to execute <tt class=literal>Animation</tt>'s
<tt class=literal>run()</tt> method. Let the show begin!

<p class=para>
The above situation is not terribly object oriented. More often, we
want an object to handle its own thread, as shown in <a href="#EXJ-CH-6-FIG-1">Figure 6.1</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-6-FIG-1">Figure 6.1: Interaction between Animation and its Thread</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0601.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 6-1]" width=503 height=166 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
<a href="#EXJ-CH-6-FIG-1">Figure 6.1</A> depicts a <tt class=literal>Runnable</tt>
object that creates and starts its own <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>. We
can have our <tt class=literal>Animation</tt> class perform these actions
in its constructor:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Animation implements Runnable { 
 
    Thread myThread; 
 
    Animation (String name) { 
        myThread = new Thread( this ); 
        myThread.start(); 
    }  
    ... 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In this case, the argument we pass to the <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>
constructor is <tt class=literal>this</tt>, the current object
instance. We keep the <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> reference in the
instance variable <tt class=literal>myThread</tt>, in case we want to stop
the show, or exercise some other kind of control.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-6-SECT-1.1.2">A natural born thread</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>Runnable</tt> interface lets us make an arbitrary
object the target of a thread, as we did above.  This is the most
important, general usage of the <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> class. In
most situations where you need to use threads, you'll create a
class that implements the <tt class=literal>Runnable</tt>
interface. I'd be remiss, however, if I didn't show you
the other technique for creating a thread. Another design option is to
make our target class a subclass of a type that is already
runnable. The <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> class itself implements the
<tt class=literal>Runnable</tt> interface; it has its own
<tt class=literal>run()</tt> method we can override to make it do
something useful:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Animation extends Thread { 
    ... 
         
    public void run() { 
        while (true ) { 
            // Draw Frames 
            ... 
            repaint(); 
        } 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The skeleton of our <tt class=literal>Animation</tt> class above looks
much the same as before, except that our class is now a kind of
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt>. To go along with this scheme, the default
(empty) constructor of the <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> class makes
itself the default target. That is, by default, the
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt> executes its own <tt class=literal>run()</tt>
method when we call the <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method, as shown in
<a href="#EXJ-CH-6-FIG-2">Figure 6.2</A>. Note that our subclass must override
the <tt class=literal>run()</tt> method in the <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>
class because <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> simply defines an empty
<tt class=literal>run()</tt> method.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-6-FIG-2">Figure 6.2: Animation as a subclass of Thread</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/je0602.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 6-2]" width=503 height=173 border=0>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Now we create an instance of <tt class=literal>Animation</tt> 
and call its <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Animation bouncy = new Animation("Bouncy"); 
bouncy.start(); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Alternatively, we can have the <tt class=literal>Animation</tt> 
object start itself when it is created, as before:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Animation extends Thread { 
 
    Animation (String name) { 
        start(); 
    } 
    ... 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Here our <tt class=literal>Animation</tt> object just calls its own
<tt class=literal>start()</tt> method when it is created.

<p class=para>
Subclassing <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> probably seems like a convenient
way to bundle a <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> and its target
<tt class=literal>run()</tt> method. However, as always, you should let
good object-oriented design dictate how you structure your classes. In
most cases, a specific <tt class=literal>run()</tt> method is probably
closely related to the functionality of a particular class in your
application, so you should implement <tt class=literal>run()</tt> in that
class. This technique has the added advantage of allowing
<tt class=literal>run()</tt> to access any <tt class=literal>private</tt>
variables and methods it might need in the class.

<p class=para>
If you subclass <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> to implement a thread, you
are saying you need a new type of object that is a kind of
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt>. While there is something unnaturally
satisfying about making an object primarily concerned with
performing a single task (like animation), the actual situations where
you'll want to create a subclass of <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>
should be rather rare. If you find you're subclassing
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt> left and right, you may want to examine
whether you are falling into the design trap of making objects that
are simply glorified functions.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-6-SECT-1.2">Controlling Threads</A></h3>

<p class=para>
We have seen the <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method used to bring a
newly created <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> to life. Three other methods
let us control a <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>'s execution:
<tt class=literal>stop()</tt>, <tt class=literal>suspend()</tt>, and
<tt class=literal>resume()</tt>. None of these methods take any arguments;
they all operate on the current thread object. The
<tt class=literal>stop()</tt> method complements
<tt class=literal>start()</tt>; it destroys the
thread. <tt class=literal>start()</tt> and <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> can
be called only once in the life of a <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>. By
contrast, the <tt class=literal>suspend()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>resume()</tt> methods can be used to arbitrarily pause
and then restart the execution of a <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>.

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Somewhere mention stop(Throwable)
There is a form of Thread.stop that takes a Throwable as an argument
and throws that exception:
        workingThread.stop(new CancelWhatYourDoingException());
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Often, for simple tasks, it is easy enough to throw away a thread when
we want to stop it and simply create a new one when want to proceed
again. <tt class=literal>suspend()</tt> and <tt class=literal>resume()</tt>
can be used in situations where the <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>'s
setup is very expensive. For example, if creating the thread involves
opening a socket and setting up some elaborate communication, it
probably makes more sense to use <tt class=literal>suspend()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>resume()</tt> with this thread.

<p class=para>
Another common need is to put a thread to sleep for some period of
time. <tt class=literal>Thread.sleep()</tt> is a static method of the
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt> class that causes the currently executing
thread to delay for a specified number of milliseconds:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
try { 
    Thread.sleep ( 1000 ); 
}  
catch ( InterruptedException e ) { 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>Thread.sleep()</tt> throws an
<tt class=literal>InterruptedException</tt> if it is interrupted by
another <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>.[1] 
When a thread is asleep, or otherwise blocked on input of some kind,
it doesn't consume 
CPU time or compete with other
threads for processing. We'll talk more about thread priority
and scheduling later.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
The <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> class contains an
<tt class=literal>interrupt()</tt> method to allow one thread to
interrupt another thread, but this functionality is not implemented in
Java 1.0.
</blockquote>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="EXJ-CH-6-SECT-1.3">A Thread's Life</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> continues to execute until one of the
following things happens:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>It returns from its target <tt class=literal>run()</tt> method

<p>
<li class=listitem>It's interrupted by an uncaught exception

<p>
<li class=listitem>Its <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> method is called

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
So what happens if the <tt class=literal>run()</tt> method for a thread
never terminates, and the application that started the thread never
calls its <tt class=literal>stop()</tt> method? The answer is that the
thread lives on, even after the application that created it has
finished. This means we have to be aware of how our threads eventually
terminate, or an application can end up leaving orphaned threads that
unnecessarily consume resources.

<p class=para>
In many cases, what we really want is to create background threads
that do simple, periodic tasks in an application. The
<tt class=literal>setDaemon()</tt> method can be used to mark a
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt> as a daemon thread that should be killed and
discarded when no other application threads remain. Normally, the Java
interpreter continues to run until all threads have completed.  But
when daemon threads are the only threads still alive, the interpreter
will exit.

<p class=para>
Here's a devilish example of using daemon 
threads:

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
class Devil extends Thread { 
 
    Devil() { 
        setDaemon( true ); 
        start(); 
    } 
         
    public void run() { 
        // Perform evil tasks 
        ... 
    } 
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In the above example, the <tt class=literal>Devil</tt> 
thread sets its daemon status when it is created. If any <tt class=literal>Devil</tt> 
threads remain when our application is otherwise complete, Java kills them 
for us. We don't have to worry about cleaning them up.

<p class=para>
Daemon threads are primarily useful in standalone Java applications
and in the implementation of the Java system itself, but not in
applets. Since an applet runs inside of another Java application, any
daemon threads it creates will continue to live until the controlling
application exits--probably not the desired effect.
