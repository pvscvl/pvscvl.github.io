<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14">2.14 Miscellaneous Differences</A></h2>

<p class=para>
A number of miscellaneous differences between Java and C are
described in the sections that follow.  Miscellaneous
differences that were mentioned elsewhere, such as the lack
of the <tt class=literal>goto</tt> statement and the <tt class=literal>sizeof</tt>
operator, are not repeated here.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.1">Local Variable Declarations</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A feature that Java has borrowed from C++ is the
ability to declare and initialize local variables anywhere
in a method body or other block of code.  Declarations and
their initializers no longer have to be the first statements
in any block--you can declare them where it is convenient
and fits well with the structure of your code.

<p class=para>
Don't let this freedom make you sloppy, however!  For
someone reading your program, it is nice to have variable
declarations grouped together in one place.  As a rule of
thumb, put your declarations at the top of the block, unless
you have some good organizational reason for putting them
elsewhere.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.2">Forward References</A></h3>

<p class=para>
For compiler efficiency, C requires that variables and
functions must be defined, or at least declared, before they
can be used or called.  That is, forward references are not
allowed in C.  Java does not make this restriction, and by
lifting it, it also does away with the whole concept of a
variable or function declaration that is separate from the
definition.

<p class=para>
Java allows very flexible forward references.  A method may
refer to a variable or another method of its class,
regardless of where in the current class the variable or
method is defined.  Similarly, it may refer to any class,
regardless of where in the current file (or outside of the
file) that class is defined.  The only place that forward
references are not allowed is in variable initialization. A
variable initializer (for local variables, class variables,
or instance variables) may not refer to other variables that have
not yet been declared and initialized.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.3">Method Overloading</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A technique that Java borrows from C++ is called <i class=emphasis>method
overloading</I>.
Overloaded methods are methods that have the same name, but
have different signatures. In other words,  they take different
types of arguments, a
different number of arguments, or the same type of arguments
in different positions in the argument list.
You cannot overload a method by changing only its return
type.  Two methods with the same name may have different
return types, but only if the method arguments also differ.
Similarly, two overloaded methods may throw different
exceptions, but only if their arguments differ as well.

<p class=para>
Method overloading is commonly used in Java to define a number of
related functions with the same name, but different
arguments.  Overloaded methods usually perform the same
basic operation, but allow the programmer to specify
arguments in different ways depending on what is convenient
in a given situation. Method overloading is discussed in more 
detail in the next chapter.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.4">The void Keyword</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>void</tt> keyword is used in Java, as in C, to
indicate that a function returns no value.  (As we will see
in the next section, constructor methods are an exception to
this rule.)

<p class=para>
Java differs from C (and is similar to C++) in that methods
that take no arguments are declared with empty parentheses,
not with the <tt class=literal>void</tt> keyword.
Java does not have any <tt class=literal>void *</tt> type, nor does it
use a <tt class=literal>(void)</tt> cast in order to ignore the
result returned by a call to a non-<tt class=literal>void</tt> method.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.5">Modifiers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java defines a number of modifier keywords that may be
applied to variable and/or method declarations to provide
additional information or place restrictions on the variable
or method:

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>final</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>final</tt> keyword is a modifier that may be applied
to classes, methods, and variables.  It has a similar, but
not identical, meaning in each case.  A <tt class=literal>final</tt> class
may never be subclassed.  A <tt class=literal>final</tt> method may never
be overridden.  A <tt class=literal>final</tt> variable may never have its
value set.  In Java 1.1, this modifier may also be applied to
local variables and method parameters. This modifier is discussed 
in more detail in the next chapter.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>native</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>native</tt> is a modifier that may be applied to method
declarations.  It indicates that the method is implemented
elsewhere in C, or in some other platform-dependent
fashion.  A <tt class=literal>native</tt> method should have a semicolon
in place of its body.  

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>synchronized</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
We saw the <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> keyword in a previous
section where it was a statement that marked a critical
section of code.  The same keyword can also be used as a
modifier for class or instance methods.
It indicates that the method modifies the internal state of
the class or the internal state of an instance of the class
in a way that is not thread-safe.  Before running a
<tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> class method, Java obtains a lock
on the class, to ensure that no other threads can 
modif the class concurrently.  Before running a
<tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> instance method, Java obtains a
lock on the instance that invoked the method, ensuring that
no other thread can modify the object at the same
time.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>transient</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>transient</tt> keyword is a modifier that may be
applied to instance fields in a class. This modifier is legal
but unused in Java 1.0. In Java 1.1, it indicates a field that
is not part of an object's persistent state and thus does not need to 
be serialized with the object.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>volatile</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>volatile</tt> keyword is a modifier that may be
applied to fields.  It specifies that the field is used by
synchronized threads and that the
compiler should not attempt to perform optimizations with it.
For example, it should read the variable's value from memory every
time and not attempt to save a copy of it on the stack.</DL>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.6">No Structures or Unions</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java does not support C <tt class=literal>struct</tt> or <tt class=literal>union</tt>
types.  Note, however, that a <tt class=literal>class</tt> is essentially
the same thing as a <tt class=literal>struct</tt>, but with more features.
And you can simulate the important features of a
<tt class=literal>union</tt> by subclassing.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.7">No Enumerated Types</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java does not support the C <tt class=literal>enum</tt> keyword for
defining types that consist of one of a specified number of
named values. This is somewhat surprising for a
strongly-typed language like Java. Enumerated types can be partially
simulated with the use of <tt class=literal>static</tt> <tt class=literal>final</tt>
constant values.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.8">No Method Types</A></h3>

<p class=para>
C allows you to store the address of a function in a
variable and to pass function addresses to other functions.
You cannot do this in Java: methods are not data, and cannot
be manipulated by Java programs.  Note, however, that
objects are data, and that objects can define methods.
[9]
So, when you need to pass a method to another method, you
declare a class that defines the desired method and pass an
instance of that class.  See, for example, the
<tt class=literal>FilenameFilter</tt> interface in the <tt class=literal>java.io</tt>
package.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[9] 
An interesting way to think about objects in Java is as a
kind of method that defines multiple entry points.
</blockquote>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.9">No Bitfields</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java does not support the C ability to define variables
that occupy particular bits within <tt class=literal>struct</tt> and
<tt class=literal>union</tt> types.  This feature of C is usually only used
to interface directly to hardware devices, which is never
necessary with Java's platform-independent programming
model.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.10">No typedef</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java does not support the C <tt class=literal>typedef</tt> keyword to
define aliases for type names.  Java has a much simpler type
naming scheme than C does, however, and so there is no need for
something like <tt class=literal>typedef</tt>.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-14.11">No Variable-Length Argument Lists</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java does not allow you to define methods that take a
variable number of arguments, as C does.  This is because
Java is a strongly typed language and there is no way to do
appropriate type checking for a method with variable
arguments.  Method overloading allows you to simulate C
"varargs" functions for simple cases, but there is no
general replacement for this C feature.
