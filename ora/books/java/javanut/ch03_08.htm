<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-8">3.8 Data Hiding and Encapsulation</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.PROGRAMMING.1"></A><a name="CH3.ENCAPSULATIO1"></A>We started this chapter by describing a class as "a
collection of data and methods." One of the important object-oriented 
techniques that we haven't discussed so far is
hiding the data within the class, and making it available
only through the methods.  This technique is often known as
<i class=emphasis>encapsulation</I>, because it seals the class's data (and
internal methods)
safely inside the "capsule" of the class, where it can be
accessed only by trusted users--i.e., by the methods of the class. 

<p class=para>
Why would you want to do this?  The most important reason is
to hide the internal implementation details of your class.
If you prevent programmers from relying on those details,
then you can safely modify the implementation without
worrying that you will break existing code that uses the
class.

<p class=para>
Another reason for encapsulation is to protect
your class against accidental or willful stupidity.  A class
often contains a number of variables that are interdependent
and must be in a consistent state.  If you allow a
programmer (this may be you yourself) to manipulate those
variables directly, she may change one variable without changing 
important related variables, thus leaving the class in an 
inconsistent state. If, instead, she had to call a method 
to change the variable, that method can be sure to do everything
necessary to keep the state consistent.

<p class=para>
Here's another way to think about encapsulation:  
When all of a class's variables are hidden, the
class's methods define the only possible operations that can
be performed on objects of that class.  Once you have
carefully tested and debugged your methods, you can be
confident that the class will work as expected.  On the
other hand, if all the variables can be directly
manipulated, the number of possibilities you have to test
becomes unmanageable.

<p class=para>
There are other reasons to hide data, too:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Internal variables that are visible externally to the class
just clutter up your class's API. Keeping visible variables
to a minimum keeps your class tidy and elegant.

<p>
<li class=listitem>If a variable is visible in your class, you have to document
it.  Save time by hiding it instead!

<p>
</UL>
<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-8.1">Visibility Modifiers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.VISIBILITY.M1"></A><a name="CH3.PUBLIC.MODIF1"></A>In most of our examples so far, you've probably noticed the
<tt class=literal>public</tt> keyword being used.  When applied to a class,
it means that the class is visible everywhere.  When applied
to a method or variable, it means that the method or
variable is visible everywhere.

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.PRIVATE.MODI1"></A>To hide variables (or methods, for that matter) you just
have to declare them <tt class=literal>private</tt>:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class Laundromat {       // People can use this class.
    private Laundry[] dirty;    // They can't see this internal variable,
    public void wash() { ... }  // but they can use these public methods
    public void dry() { ... }   // to manipulate the internal variable.
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
A <tt class=literal>private</tt> field of a class is visible only in
methods defined within that class.  (Or, in Java 1.1, in
classes defined within the class.)  Similarly, a
<tt class=literal>private</tt> method may only be invoked by methods within
the class (or methods of classes within the class).  Private
members are not visible within subclasses, and are <i class=emphasis>not</I>
inherited by subclasses as other members are.
[11]
Of course, non-<tt class=literal>private</tt> methods that invoke
<tt class=literal>private</tt> methods internally are inherited and may be
invoked by subclasses.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[11] 
Every object does, of course, have its own copy of all
fields of all superclasses, including the <tt class=literal>private</tt>
fields.  The methods defined by the object can never refer
to or use the <tt class=literal>private</tt> fields of superclasses,
however, and so we say that those fields are not inherited.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.PROTECTED.MO1"></A>Besides <tt class=literal>public</tt> and <tt class=literal>private</tt>, Java has two
other visibility levels: <tt class=literal>protected</tt> and the default
visibility level, "package visibility," which applies if
none of the <tt class=literal>public</tt>, <tt class=literal>private</tt>, and
<tt class=literal>protected</tt> keywords are used.

<p class=para>
A <tt class=literal>protected</tt> member of a class is visible within the
class where it is defined, of course, and within all
subclasses of the class, and also within all classes that
are in the same package as that class.  You should use
<tt class=literal>protected</tt> visibility when you want to hide fields
and methods from code that uses your class, but want those
fields and methods to be fully accessible to code that
extends your class.

<p class=para>
The default package visibility is more restrictive than
<tt class=literal>protected</tt>, but less restrictive than
<tt class=literal>private</tt>.  If a class member is not declared with any
of the <tt class=literal>public</tt>, <tt class=literal>private</tt>, or <tt class=literal>protected</tt>
keywords, then it is visible only within the class that
defines it and within classes that are part of the same
package.  It is not visible to subclasses unless those
subclasses are part of the same package.

<p class=para>
A note about packages: A package is a group of related and
possibly cooperating classes.  All non-<tt class=literal>private</tt>
members of all classes in the package are
visible to all other classes in the package.  This is okay
because the classes are assumed to know about, and trust,
each other.
[12]
The only time difficulty arises is when you write programs
without a <tt class=literal>package</tt> statement.  These classes are
thrown into a default package with other
<tt class=literal>package</tt>-less classes, and all their
non-<tt class=literal>private</tt> members are visible throughout the
package.  (The default package usually consists of all
classes in the current working directory.)

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[12] 
If you're a C++ programmer, you can say that classes
within the same package are <tt class=literal>friend</tt>-ly to each other.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
There is an important point to make about subclass access to
<tt class=literal>protected</tt> members.  A subclass inherits the
<tt class=literal>protected</tt> members of its superclass, but it can only
access those members through instances of itself, not
directly in instances of the superclass.  Suppose, for
example, that <tt class=literal>A</tt>, <tt class=literal>B</tt>, and <tt class=literal>C</tt> are
<tt class=literal>public</tt> classes, each defined in a different package,
and that <tt class=literal>a</tt>, <tt class=literal>b</tt>, and <tt class=literal>c</tt> are instances
of those classes.  Let <tt class=literal>B</tt> be a subclass of <tt class=literal>A</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>C</tt> be a subclass of <tt class=literal>B</tt>.  Now, if <tt class=literal>A</tt>
has a <tt class=literal>protected</tt> field <tt class=literal>x</tt>, then the class B
inherits that field, and its methods can use <tt class=literal>this.x</tt>,
<tt class=literal>b.x</tt> and <tt class=literal>c.x</tt>.  But it cannot access
<tt class=literal>a.x</tt>.  Similarly, if <tt class=literal>A</tt> has a
<tt class=literal>protected</tt> method <tt class=literal>f()</tt>, then the methods of
class <tt class=literal>B</tt> can invoke <tt class=literal>this.f()</tt>, <tt class=literal>b.f()</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>c.f()</tt>, but they cannot invoke <tt class=literal>a.f()</tt>.

The details of member visibility in Java can become quite
confusing.  Here are some simple rules of thumb for using
visibility modifiers:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Use <tt class=literal>public</tt> only for methods and constants that form
part of the public API of the class.  Certain very important
or very frequently used fields may also be <tt class=literal>public</tt>,
but it is common practice to make fields non-<tt class=literal>public</tt>
and encapsulate them with <tt class=literal>public</tt> accessor methods.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Use <tt class=literal>protected</tt> for fields and methods that aren't
necessary to use the class, but that may be of interest to
anyone creating a subclass as part of a different package.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Use the default package visibility for fields and methods
that you want to be hidden outside of the package, but which
you want cooperating classes within the same package to have
access to.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Use <tt class=literal>private</tt> for fields and methods that are only
used inside the class and should be hidden everywhere else.

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
Note that you can't take advantage of package visibility
unless you use the <tt class=literal>package</tt> statement to group your
related classes into packages.  See <a href="ch13_01.htm">Chapter 13, <i>Java Syntax</i></A>, <i class=emphasis>Java
Syntax</I>, for a table that summarizes the Java visibility
modifiers and other modifiers.

<p class=para>
In the <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> example we've been using, we've
declared the circle position and radius to be <tt class=literal>public</tt>
fields.  In fact, the <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> class is one where it
may well make sense to keep those visible--it is a simple
enough class, with no dependencies between the variables.

<p class=para>
On the other hand, suppose we wanted to impose a maximum
radius on objects of the <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> class.  Then it
would be better to hide the <tt class=literal>r</tt> variable so that it
could not be set directly.  Instead of a visible <tt class=literal>r</tt>
variable, we'd implement a <tt class=literal>setRadius()</tt> method that
verifies that the specified radius isn't too large and then
sets the <tt class=literal>r</tt> variable internally.
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-14">Example 3.14</A>
shows how we might implement <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> with
encapsulated data and a restriction on radius size.  For
convenience, we use <tt class=literal>protected</tt> fields for the radius
and position variables.  This means that subclasses of
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt>, or cooperating classes within the
<tt class=literal>shapes</tt> package are able to access these
variables directly.  To any other classes, however, the
variables are hidden.  Also, note the <tt class=literal>private</tt>
constant and method used to check whether a specified radius
is legal.  And finally, notice the <tt class=literal>public</tt> methods
that allow you to set and query the values of the instance
variables.
