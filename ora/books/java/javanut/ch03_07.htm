<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-7">3.7 Overriding Methods</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.OVERRIDDEN.M1"></A><a name="CH3.METHODS3"></A>When a class defines a method using the same name, return
type, and arguments as a method in its superclass, the method
in the class <i class=emphasis>overrides</I> the method in the superclass.
When the method is invoked for an object of the class, it is
the new definition of the method that is called, not the
superclass' old definition.

<p class=para>
Method overriding is an important and useful technique in
object-oriented programming.  Suppose we define a subclass
<tt class=literal>Ellipse</tt> of our <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> class.
[9]
Then it would
be important for <tt class=literal>Ellipse</tt> to override the
<tt class=literal>area()</tt> and <tt class=literal>circumference()</tt> methods of
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt>.  <tt class=literal>Ellipse</tt> would have to implement new
versions of these functions because the formulas that apply
to circles don't work for ellipses.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[9] 
This is admittedly a strange thing to do, since,
mathematically, a circle is a kind of ellipse, and it is
customary to derive a more specific class from a more
general one.  Nevertheless, it is a useful example here.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Before we go any further with the discussion of method
overriding, be sure that you understand the difference
between method overriding and method overloading, which we
discussed earlier.  As you
probably recall, method overloading refers to the practice
of defining multiple methods (in the same class) with the
same name but with differing argument lists.
This is very different from method overriding, and it is
important not to get them confused!

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-7.1">Overriding Is Not Shadowing</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Although Java treats the variables and methods of a class
analogously in many ways, method overriding is not like
variable shadowing at all: You can refer to shadowed variables
simply by casting an object to the appropriate type.  You
cannot invoke overridden methods with this technique,
however.
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-12">Example 3.12</A>
illustrates this crucial difference.

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-EX-12">Example 3.12: Method Overriding versus Variable Shadowing</A></h4>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class A {
    int i = 1;
    int f() { return i; }
}
class B extends A {
    int i = 2;                          // Shadows variable i in class A.
    int f() { return -i; }              // Overrides method f in class A.
}
public class override_test {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        B b = new B();
        System.out.println(b.i);     // Refers to B.i; prints 2.
        System.out.println(b.f());   // Refers to B.f(); prints -2.
        A a = (A) b;                 // Cast b to an instance of class A.
        System.out.println(a.i);     // Now refers to A.i; prints 1;
        System.out.println(a.f());   // Still refers to B.f(); prints -2;
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
While this difference between method overriding and variable
shadowing may seem surprising at first, a little thought makes
the purpose clear.  Suppose we have a bunch of
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt> and <tt class=literal>Ellipse</tt> (a subclass of
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt>) objects that we are manipulating.  To keep
track of the circles and ellipses, we store them in an array
of type <tt class=literal>Circle[]</tt>, casting all the <tt class=literal>Ellipse</tt>
objects to <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> objects before we store them.
Then, when we loop through the elements of this array, we
don't have to know or care whether the element is actually a
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt> or an <tt class=literal>Ellipse</tt>.  What we do care
very much about, however, is that the correct value is
computed when we invoke the <tt class=literal>area()</tt> method of any
element of the array.  That is, we don't want to use the
formula for the area of a circle when the object is actually
an ellipse!

<p class=para>
Seen in this context, it is not surprising at all that method
overriding is handled differently by Java than variable
shadowing.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-7.2">final Methods</A></h3>

<p class=para>
If a method is declared <tt class=literal>final</tt>, it means that the
method declaration is the "final" one--that it cannot be
overridden.  <tt class=literal>static</tt> methods and <tt class=literal>private</tt>
methods (which we haven't learned about yet) cannot be
overridden either, nor can the methods of a <tt class=literal>final</tt>
class.  If a method cannot be overridden, the compiler may
perform certain optimizations on it, as we'll see below.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-7.3">Dynamic Method Lookup</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.DYNAMIC.METH1"></A>If we have an array of <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> and <tt class=literal>Ellipse</tt>
objects, how does the compiler know to call the <tt class=literal>Circle area()</tt>
method or the <tt class=literal>Ellipse area()</tt> method for
any given item in the array?  The compiler does not know
this; it can't.  The compiler knows that it does not know,
however, and produces code that uses "dynamic method lookup"
at run-time.  
When the interpreter runs the code, it looks
up the appropriate <tt class=literal>area()</tt> method to call for each of
the objects.  That is, when the interpreter interprets
the expression <tt class=literal>s.area()</tt>, it dynamically looks for an
<tt class=literal>area()</tt> method associated with the particular object
referred to by the variable <tt class=literal>s</tt>.  It does not simply
use the <tt class=literal>area()</tt> method that is statically associated
with the type of the variable <tt class=literal>s</tt>.
[10]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[10] 
C++ programmers should note that dynamic method lookup is
what C++ does for <tt class=literal>virtual</tt> functions.  An
important difference between Java and C++ is that Java does
not have a <tt class=literal>virtual</tt> keyword; methods in Java
are "virtual" by default.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Dynamic method lookup is fast, but it is not as fast as
invoking a method directly.  Fortunately, there are a number
of cases in which Java does not need to use dynamic method
lookup.  <tt class=literal>static</tt> methods cannot be overridden, so
they are always invoked directly.  <tt class=literal>private</tt> methods
(which we haven't learned about yet) are not inherited by
subclasses and so cannot be overridden by subclasses; this
means the Java compiler can safely invoke them without
dynamic method lookup as well.  <tt class=literal>final</tt> methods are
invoked directly for the same reason: they cannot be
overridden.  Finally, when a method of a <tt class=literal>final</tt> class
is invoked through an instance of the class or a subclass
of it, then it, too, can be invoked without the overhead
of dynamic lookup.  These <tt class=literal>static</tt>, <tt class=literal>final</tt>, and
<tt class=literal>private</tt> methods that can be invoked directly are
also candidates for inlining--i.e., if the methods are
short, the compiler may simply insert the method body into
the code rather than inserting a call to the method.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-7.4">Invoking an Overridden Method</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.INVOKING.OVE1"></A>We've seen the important differences between method
overriding and variable shadowing.  Nevertheless, the Java syntax for
invoking an overridden method is very similar to the syntax
for accessing a shadowed variable: both use the
<tt class=literal>super</tt> keyword.<a name="CH3.SUPER.KEYWOR2"></A>
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-13">Example 3.13</A>
illustrates this.

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-EX-13">Example 3.13: Invoking an Overridden Method</A></h4>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class A {
    int i = 1;
    int f() { return i; }        // A very simple method.
}
class B extends A {
    int i;                       // This variable shadows i in A.
    int f() {                    // This method overrides f() in A.
        i = super.i + 1;         // It retrieves A.i this way.
        return super.f() + i;    // And it invokes A.f() this way.
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Recall that when you use <tt class=literal>super</tt> to refer to a shadowed
variable, it is the same as casting <tt class=literal>this</tt> to the
superclass type and accessing the variable through that.  On
the other hand, using <tt class=literal>super</tt> to invoke an overridden
method is not the same as casting <tt class=literal>this</tt>.  In this
case, <tt class=literal>super</tt> has the special purpose of turning off
dynamic method lookup and invoking the specific method that
the superclass defines or inherits.

<p class=para>
In
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-13">Example 3.13</A>
we use <tt class=literal>super</tt> to invoke an overridden method that is
actually defined in the immediate superclass.  <tt class=literal>super</tt>
also works perfectly well to invoke overridden methods that
are defined further up the class hierarchy.  This is because
the overridden method is inherited by the immediate
superclass, and so the <tt class=literal>super</tt> syntax does in fact
refer to the correct method.

<p class=para>
To make this more concrete,
suppose class <tt class=literal>A</tt> defines method <tt class=literal>f</tt>, and that <tt class=literal>B</tt>
is a subclass of <tt class=literal>A</tt>, and that <tt class=literal>C</tt> is a subclass 
of <tt class=literal>B</tt> that overrides method <tt class=literal>f</tt>.  Then you can still use:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
super.f()
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
to invoke the overridden method from within class <tt class=literal>C</tt>.  This
is because class <tt class=literal>B</tt> inherits method <tt class=literal>f</tt> from 
class <tt class=literal>A</tt>. If classes <tt class=literal>A</tt>, <tt class=literal>B</tt>, and <tt class=literal>C</tt>
all define method <tt class=literal>f</tt>, however, then
calling <tt class=literal>super.f()</tt> in class <tt class=literal>C</tt> invokes class <tt class=literal>B</tt>'s
definition of the method.  In this case, there is no way to
invoke <tt class=literal>A.f()</tt> from within class <tt class=literal>C</tt>.  <tt class=literal>super.super.f()</tt>
is not legal Java syntax!

<p class=para>
It is important to note that <tt class=literal>super</tt> can only be used
to invoke overridden methods from within the class that does
the overriding.  With our <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> and <tt class=literal>Ellipse</tt> 
classes, for example, there is no way to write a program (with or 
without <tt class=literal>super</tt>) that invokes the <tt class=literal>Circle</tt>
<tt class=literal>area()</tt> method on an object of type <tt class=literal>Ellipse</tt>.
The only way to do this is to use <tt class=literal>super</tt> in a method
within the <tt class=literal>Ellipse</tt> class.

<p class=para>
Finally, note that this form of <tt class=literal>super</tt> does not have to occur
in the first statement in a method, as it does when used to
invoke a superclass constructor method.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-7.5">Finalizer Chaining Revisited</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Now that we've discussed method overriding and how to invoke
an overridden method, we can return to the issue of the
finalizer method that we left dangling earlier on.

<p class=para>
In Java, constructor methods are automatically chained, but
finalizer methods are not.  If you define a
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method to free resources allocated by
your class, you may be overriding a <tt class=literal>finalize()</tt>
method in a superclass that frees resources allocated by
that class.  If your finalizer method does not invoke the
superclass finalizer, the superclass finalizer never gets called, and
resources are not deallocated when they should be.

<p class=para>
To prevent this, you should be sure to invoke the superclass
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method.  The best time to do this is
usually after your <tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method has done all of
its deallocation.  It is a good idea to add the following call:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
super.finalize();
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
as the last line of all your finalizer methods.  You should
do this even if you know that none of your class's
superclasses have finalizer methods, because future
implementations of the class may include one.
