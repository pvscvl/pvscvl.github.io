<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-0-SECT-2">Changes Since the First Edition</A></h2>

<p class=para>
The many changes in Java 1.1 have resulted in changes to this book.
The most significant change since the first edition is a
direct result of the large size of Java 1.1: Java has grown
too large to fit in a single book, even in quick-reference
form.  Thus, we need to split <i class=emphasis>Java in a Nutshell</I> into
multiple volumes.  This volume, the "original" <i class=emphasis>Java in a
Nutshell</I> documents the most commonly used features of
Java, and it is an indispensable volume for all Java
programmers.

<p class=para>
We are planning to publish a separate volume that covers
the Java "Enterprise APIs," which include the database
connectivity, remote method invocation, and security
features of Java 1.1, as well as other forthcoming
components, such as CORBA IDL support and the electronic
commerce framework.  And as new Java APIs are developed and
released, we may consider adding new volumes to the
<i class=emphasis>Java in a Nutshell</I> series.

<p class=para>
While I was working on this second edition of <i class=emphasis>Java in a
Nutshell</I>, it became clear that, even without the
enterprise material, the book was becoming too long.
(Too long, that is, to remain a useful quick reference, and
too long to keep at an affordable price.)  Something had to
give. The most logical solution was to remove the example programs, which
are tutorial in nature, from the book, which is a quick-reference
at heart. However, we didn't want
to surprise faithful readers by removing the examples
altogether, so we decided to pare
down the example chapters to the bare minimum.  You'll
notice that Part III contains examples of using the new Java
1.1 features, such as the JavaBeans API and object serialization,
but it does not contain the majority of the old examples from the first
edition.
For now, Part III contains useful examples for experienced
Java programmers who want to learn about the new features of
Java 1.1.  When Java 1.2 is released, though, we expect
that we will have to remove the example section entirely.

<p class=para>
Readers familiar with the first edition of <i class=emphasis>Java in a
Nutshell</I> will notice some other changes as well.  The
table of contents has been rearranged to accommodate all the
new material.  We've used a new easier-to-read font for code
listings.  And we've included cross-reference material (that
used to be available only in separate index chapters)
directly in the quick-reference section, which should make
that section substantially more useful.  Be sure to read
<i class=emphasis>How To Use This Quick Reference</I> at the beginning of
the reference section to learn about these and other changes
to the quick-reference format.
