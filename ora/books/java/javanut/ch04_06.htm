<p class=para>
Internationalization
[1]
is the process of enabling a program to run internationally.<a name="CH4.INTERNATIONA1"></A>
That is, an internationalized program has the flexibility to
run correctly in any country.  Once a program has been
internationalized, enabling it to run in a particular
country and/or language is merely a matter of "localizing" it
for that country and language, or <i class=emphasis>locale</I>.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
This word is sometimes abbreviated I18N, because there are
18 letters between the first I and the last N.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
You might think that the main task of localization is the
matter of translating a program's user-visible text into
a local language.  While this is an important task,
it is not by any means the only one.  Other concerns
include displaying dates and times in the
customary format for the locale, displaying number and
currency values in the customary format for the locale, and
sorting strings in the customary order for the locale.

<p class=para>
Underlying all these localization issues is the even more
fundamental issue of character encodings.  Almost every
useful program must perform input and output of text, and
before we can even think about textual I/O, we must be able
to work with the local character encoding standard.  This
hurdle to internationalization lurks slightly below the
surface, and is not very "programmer-visible."
Nevertheless, it is one of the most important and difficult
issues in internationalization.

<p class=para>
As described in <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, <i>Internationalization</i></A>,
Java 1.1 provides facilities that address all of these
internationalization issues.  If you write programs that
correctly make use of these facilities, the task of
localizing your program for a new country really does boil
down to the relatively simple matter of hiring a translator
to convert your program's messages.  With the expansion of
the global economy, and particularly of the global Internet,
writing internationalized programs is going to become more
and more important, and you should begin to take advantage
of Java's internationalization capabilities right away.

<p class=para>
There are several distinct pieces to the problem of
internationalization, and Java's solution to this problem
also comes in distinct pieces.  The first issue in
internationalization is the matter of knowing what locale
a program is running in.  A locale is typically defined as a
political, geographical, or cultural region that has a
distinct language or distinct conventions for things such as
date and time formats.  The notion of a locale is
encapsulated in Java 1.1 by the <tt class=literal>Locale</tt> class, which
is part of the <tt class=literal>java.util</tt> package.  Every Java
program has a default locale, which is inherited from the
operating system (where it may be set by the user).
A program can simply rely on this default, or it can
change the default.  Additionally, all Java methods that
rely on the default locale also have variants that allow you
to explicitly specify a locale.  Typically, though, using
the default locale is exactly what you want to do.

<p class=para>
Once a program knows what locale it is running in, the most
fundamental internationalization issue, as noted above, is
the ability to read and write localized text.  Since Java
uses the Unicode encoding for its characters and strings,
any character of any commonly-used modern written language
is representable in a Java program, which puts Java at a
huge advantage over older languages such as C and C++.
Thus, working with localized text is merely a matter of
converting from the local character encoding to Unicode when
reading text, such as a file or input from the user, and
converting from Unicode to the local encoding when writing
text.  Java's solution to this problem is in the
<tt class=literal>java.io</tt> package, in the form of a new suite of
character-based input and output streams (known as "readers"
and "writers") that complement the existing byte-based input
and output streams.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>FileReader</tt> class, for example, is a
character-based input stream used to read characters (which
are not the same as bytes in all languages) from a file.
The <tt class=literal>FileReader</tt> class assumes that the specified file
is encoded using the default character encoding for the
default locale, so it converts characters from the local
encoding to Unicode characters as it reads them.  In most
cases, this assumption is a good one, so all you need to
do to internationalize the character set handling of your
program is to switch from a <tt class=literal>FileInputStream</tt> to a
<tt class=literal>FileReader</tt> object, and make similar switches for text
output as well.  On the other hand, if you need to read a
file that is encoded using some character set other than the
default character set of the default locale, you can use a
<tt class=literal>FileInputStream</tt> to read the bytes of the file, and
then use an <tt class=literal>InputStreamReader</tt> to convert the stream
of bytes to a stream of characters.  When you create an
<tt class=literal>InputStreamReader</tt>, you specify the name of the
encoding in use, and it performs the appropriate
conversion automatically.

<p class=para>
As you can see, internationalizing the character set of your
programs is a simple matter of switching from byte I/O
streams to character I/O streams.  Internationalizing other
aspects of your program requires a little more effort.  The
classes in the <tt class=literal>java.text</tt> package are designed to
allow you to internationalize your handling of numbers,
dates, times, string comparisons, and so on.
<tt class=literal>NumberFormat</tt> is used to convert numbers, monetary
amounts, and percentages to an appropriate textual format
for a locale.  Similarly, the <tt class=literal>DateFormat</tt> class,
along with the <tt class=literal>Calendar</tt> and <tt class=literal>TimeZone</tt> classes
from the <tt class=literal>java.util</tt> package, are used to display dates
and times in a locale-specific way.  The <tt class=literal>Collator</tt>
class is used to compare strings according to the
alphabetization rules of a given locale, and the
<tt class=literal>BreakIterator</tt> class is used to locate word, line,
and sentence boundaries.

<p class=para>
The final major problem of internationalization is making
your program flexible enough to display messages (or any
type of user-visible text, such as the labels on GUI
buttons) to the user in an appropriate language for the
current locale.  Typically, this means that the program
cannot use hard-coded messages and must instead read in a
set of messages at run-time, based on the locale setting.
Java provides an easy way to do this.  You define your
messages as key/value pairs in a <tt class=literal>ResourceBundle</tt>
subclass.  Then, you create a subclass of
<tt class=literal>ResourceBundle</tt> for each language or locale your
application supports, naming each class following a
convention that includes the locale name.
At run-time, you can use the
<tt class=literal>ResourceBundle.getBundle()</tt> method to load the
appropriate <tt class=literal>ResourceBundle</tt> class for the current
locale.  The <tt class=literal>ResourceBundle</tt> contains the messages
your application uses, each associated with a key, that
serves as the message name.  Using this technique, your application can look
up a locale-dependent message translation based on a
locale-independent message name.  Note that this technique
is useful for things other than textual messages.  It can be
used to internationalize icons, or any other
locale-dependent object used by your application.

<p class=para>
There is one final twist to this problem of
internationalizing messages.  Often, we want to output
messages such as, "Error at line 5 of file hello.java.",
where parts of the message are static, and parts are
dynamically generated at run-time (such as the line number
and filename above).  This is further complicated by the fact
that when we translate such messages the values we
substitute in at run-time may appear in a different order.
For example, in some different English speaking locale, we
might want to display the line above as: "hello.java: error
at line 5". The <tt class=literal>MessageFormat</tt> class of the
<tt class=literal>java.text</tt> package allows you to substitute dynamic
values into static messages in a very flexible way and
helps tremendously with this situation, particularly when
used in conjunction with resource bundles.
