<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-6">3.6 Subclasses and Inheritance</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.CLASSES2"></A>The <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> class we've defined is good for abstract
mathematical manipulation.  For some applications this is
exactly what we need.  For other applications, we want to be
able to manipulate circles <i class=emphasis>and</I> draw them on the
screen.  This means we need a new class,
<tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt>, that has all the functionality of
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt>, but also has the ability to be drawn.

<p class=para>
We want to implement <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> so that it can
make use of the code we've already written for
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt>.  One way to do that is the following:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class GraphicCircle {
    // Here is the mathematical circle.
    public Circle c;    
    // Here are the old methods.
    public double area() { return c.area(); }
    public double circumference() { return c.circumference(); }
    // The new graphic variables and methods go here.
    public Color outline, fill;
    public void draw(DrawWindow dw) { /* code omitted */ }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This approach would work, but it is not particularly
elegant.  The problem is that we have to write stubs for
methods like <tt class=literal>area()</tt> and <tt class=literal>circumference()</tt> that
have nothing to do with drawing circles.  It would be nice
if we didn't have to do this.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-6.1">Extending a Class</A></h3>

<p class=para>
In fact, we don't have to do it this way.  Java allows us to
define <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> as an extension, or
<i class=emphasis>subclass</I> of <tt class=literal>Circle</tt>.
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-10">Example 3.10</A>
shows how.  Note that this example assumes we have two other
classes of objects defined: <tt class=literal>Color</tt>, which represents a
color, and <tt class=literal>DrawWindow</tt>, a class that has the window
into which drawing is done and that defines the primitive
methods to do the drawing.

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-EX-10">Example 3.10: Subclassing a Class</A></h4>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class GraphicCircle extends Circle {
    // We automatically inherit the variables and methods of
    // Circle, so we only have to put the new stuff here.
    // We've omitted the GraphicCircle constructor, for now.
    Color outline, fill;
    public void draw(DrawWindow dw) { 
        dw.drawCircle(x, y, r, outline, fill); 
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>extends</tt> keyword tells Java that
<tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> is a subclass of <tt class=literal>Circle</tt>, and
that it <i class=emphasis>inherits</I> the fields and methods of that
class.
[7]
The definition of the <tt class=literal>draw()</tt> method shows variable
inheritance--this method uses the <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> variables
<tt class=literal>x</tt>, <tt class=literal>y</tt>, and <tt class=literal>r</tt> as if they were defined
right in <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> itself.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[7] 
Except for <tt class=literal>private</tt> fields and methods.
We'll discuss <tt class=literal>private</tt> members of a class later.
C++ programmers should note that <tt class=literal>extends</tt> is the Java 
equivalent of the <tt class=literal>:</tt> operator in C++--both indicate 
the superclass of a class.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> also inherits the methods of
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt>.  Thus, if we have a <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt>
object referred to by variable <tt class=literal>gc</tt>, we can say:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
double area = gc.area();
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This works just as if the <tt class=literal>area()</tt> method were
defined in <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> itself.

<p class=para>
Another feature of subclassing is that every
<tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> object is also a perfectly legal
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt> object.  Thus, if <tt class=literal>gc</tt>
refers to a <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> object, we can assign it
to a <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> variable, and we can forget all about its extra
graphic capabilities: <tt class=literal>Circle c = gc;</tt>.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-6.2">Final Classes</A></h3>

<p class=para>
When a class is declared with the <tt class=literal>final</tt> modifier, it
means that it cannot be extended or subclassed.
<tt class=literal>java.lang.System</tt> is an example of a <tt class=literal>final</tt>
class.  Declaring a class <tt class=literal>final</tt> prevents unwanted
extensions to the class.  But it also allows the compiler to
make some optimizations when invoking the methods of a
class.  We'll explore this in more detail when we talk about
method overriding later in this chapter.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-6.3">Superclasses, Object, and the Class Hierarchy</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.OBJECT.CLASS1"></A>In our example, <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> is a subclass of
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt>.  We can also say that <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> is the
<i class=emphasis>superclass</I> of <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt>.  The superclass
of a class is specified in its <tt class=literal>extends</tt> clause:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class GraphicCircle extends Circle { ... }
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Every class you define has a superclass.  If you do not
specify the superclass with an <tt class=literal>extends</tt> clause,
the superclass is the class <tt class=literal>Object</tt>.
<tt class=literal>Object</tt> is a special class for a couple of reasons:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>It is the only class that does not have a superclass.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The methods defined by <tt class=literal>Object</tt> can be called by
any Java object.

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
Because every class has a superclass, classes in Java
form a <i class=emphasis>class hierarchy</I>, which can be represented as a
tree with <tt class=literal>Object</tt> at its root.
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-FIG-1">Figure 3.1</A>
shows a class hierarchy diagram which includes our
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt> and <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> classes, as well as
some of the standard classes from the Java API.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-6.4">Subclass Constructors</A></h3>

<p class=para>
In
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-10">Example 3.10</A>
we left out the constructor method for our new <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt>
class.  Let's implement that now.  Here's one way:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public GraphicCircle(double x, double y, double r, 
                                Color outline, Color fill)
{
    this.x = x; 
    this.y = y; 
    this.r = r;
    this.outline = outline; 
    this.fill = fill;
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This constructor relies on the fact that
<tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> inherits all the variables of
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt> and simply initializes those variables
itself.   But this duplicates the code of the <tt class=literal>Circle</tt>
constructor, and if <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> did more elaborate
initialization, it could become quite wasteful.
Furthermore, if the <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> class had internal
<tt class=literal>private</tt> fields (discussed later), we wouldn't be
able to initialize them like this.  What we
need is a way of calling a <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> constructor from
within our <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> constructor.
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-11">Example 3.11</A>
shows how we can do this.

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-EX-11">Example 3.11: Invoking a Superclass's Constructor</A></h4>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public GraphicCircle(double x, double y, double r, 
                                Color outline, Color fill) 
{
    super(x, y, r);
    this.outline = outline; 
    this.fill = fill;
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.SUPER.KEYWOR1"></A><tt class=literal>super</tt> is a reserved word in Java.  One of its uses
is that shown in the example--to invoke the constructor
method of a superclass.  Its use is analogous to the use of
the <tt class=literal>this</tt> keyword to invoke one constructor method of
a class from within another.  Using <tt class=literal>super</tt> to invoke
a constructor is subject to the same restrictions as using
<tt class=literal>this</tt> to invoke a constructor:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>super</tt> may only be used in this way within a
constructor method.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The call to the superclass constructor must appear as the
first statement within the constructor method.  It must
appear even before variable declarations.

<p>
</UL>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-6.5">Constructor Chaining</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.CONSTRUCTORS2"></A><a name="CH3.CHAINING1"></A>When you define a class, Java guarantees that the class's
constructor method is called whenever an instance of
that class is created.  It also guarantees that the
constructor is called when an instance of any subclass
is created.  In order to guarantee this second point, Java
must ensure that every constructor method calls its
superclass constructor method.  If the first
statement in a constructor is not an explicit call to a
constructor of the superclass with the <tt class=literal>super</tt>
keyword, then Java implicitly inserts the call
<tt class=literal>super()</tt>--that is, it calls the superclass
constructor with no arguments.  If the superclass does not
have a constructor that takes no arguments, this causes a
compilation error.

<p class=para>
There is one exception to the rule that Java invokes
<tt class=literal>super()</tt> implicitly if you do not do so explicitly.
If the first line of a constructor, <tt class=literal>C1</tt>, uses the
<tt class=literal>this()</tt> syntax to invoke another constructor,
<tt class=literal>C2</tt>, of the class, Java relies on <tt class=literal>C2</tt> to
invoke the superclass constructor, and does not insert a
call to <tt class=literal>super()</tt> into <tt class=literal>C1</tt>.  Of course, if
<tt class=literal>C2</tt> itself uses <tt class=literal>this()</tt> to invoke a third
constructor, <tt class=literal>C2</tt> does not call <tt class=literal>super()</tt>
either, but somewhere along the chain, a constructor
either explicitly or implicitly invokes the superclass
constructor, which is what is required.

<p class=para>
Consider what happens when we create a new instance of the
<tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> class.  First, the <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt>
constructor shown in
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-11">Example 3.11</A>
is invoked.  This constructor explicitly invokes a
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt> constructor and that <tt class=literal>Circle</tt>
constructor implicitly calls <tt class=literal>super()</tt> to invoke the
constructor of its superclass, <tt class=literal>Object</tt>.  The body of
the <tt class=literal>Object</tt> constructor runs first, followed by the
body of the <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> constructor, and finally followed
by the body of the <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> constructor.

<p class=para>
What this all means is that constructor calls are
"chained"--any time an object is created, a sequence of
constructor methods are invoked, from subclass to superclass
on up to <tt class=literal>Object</tt> at the root of the class hierarchy.
Because a superclass constructor is always invoked as
the first statement of its subclass constructor, the body of
the <tt class=literal>Object</tt> constructor always runs first, followed
by the body of its subclass, and on down the class hierarchy
to the class that is being instantiated.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-6.6">The Default Constructor</A></h3>

<p class=para>
There is one missing piece in the description of constructor
chaining above.  If a constructor does not invoke a
superclass constructor, Java does so implicitly.  But what
if a class is declared without any constructor at all?  In
this case, Java implicitly adds a constructor to the class.
This default constructor does nothing but invoke the
superclass constructor.  

<p class=para>
For example, if we did not declare a constructor for the
<tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> class, Java would have implicitly
inserted this constructor:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public GraphicCircle() { super(); }
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Note that if the superclass, <tt class=literal>Circle()</tt>, did not
declare a no-argument constructor, then this automatically
inserted default constructor would cause a compilation
error.  If a class does not define a no-argument
constructor, then all of its subclasses must define
constructors that explicitly invoke the superclass
constructor with the necessary arguments.

<p class=para>
It can be confusing when Java implicitly calls a constructor
or inserts a constructor definition into a class--something
is happening that does not appear in your code!  Therefore,
it is good coding style, whenever you rely on an implicit
superclass constructor call or on a default constructor, to
insert a comment noting this fact.  Your comments might look
like those in the following example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class A {
    int i;
    public A() {
        // Implicit call to super(); here.
        i = 3;
    }
}
class B extends A {
    // Default constructor: public B() { super(); }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If a class does not declare any constructor, it is
given a <tt class=literal>publicly</tt> constructor by default.  Classes that
do not want to be publically instantiated, should declare a
<tt class=literal>protected</tt> constructor to prevent the insertion of
this <tt class=literal>public</tt> constructor.  Classes that never want to
be instantiated at all should define a <tt class=literal>private</tt>
constructor.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-6.7">Finalizer Chaining?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
You might assume that since Java chains constructor methods
that it also automatically chains the
finalizer methods for an object.  In other words, you may think 
that the finalizer method of a class automatically invokes the
finalizer of its superclass.  In fact, Java does <i class=emphasis>not</I>
do this.  In practice, finalizer methods are relatively
rare, and the need for finalizer chaining rarely arises.  If
a class <tt class=literal>B</tt> with a finalizer method is a subclass of a class <tt class=literal>A</tt>
with its own finalizer method, then <tt class=literal>B</tt>'s finalizer should be
sure to invoke <tt class=literal>A</tt>'s finalizer, explicitly creating a chain of
finalizers.  This is a little tricky, since finalizers
always have the same name (<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt>), and we
haven't yet learned how to invoke a method in the superclass
when that method is also defined in the subclass.  We'll 
return to the issue of finalizer chaining when we learn how.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-6.8">Shadowed Variables</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Suppose that our <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> class has a new
variable that specifies the  resolution, in dots per inch, of the
<tt class=literal>DrawWindow</tt> object in which it is going to be drawn.
And further, suppose that it names that new variable <tt class=literal>r</tt>:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class GraphicCircle extends Circle {
    Color outline, fill;
    float r;  // New variable.  Resolution in dots-per-inch.
    public GraphicCircle(double x, double y, double rad, Color o, Color f) {
        super(x, y, rad); outline = o; fill = f;
    }
    public void setResolution(float resolution) { r = resolution; }
    public void draw(DrawWindow dw) { dw.drawCircle(x, y, r, outline, fill); }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Now, with this resolution variable declared, when we use the
variable <tt class=literal>r</tt> in the <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt> class, we
are no longer referring to the radius of the circle.  The
resolution variable <tt class=literal>r</tt> in <tt class=literal>GraphicCircle</tt>
<i class=emphasis>shadows</I> the radius variable <tt class=literal>r</tt> in
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt>.
[8]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[8] 
This is a contrived example, of course--we could simply
rename the variable and avoid the issue.  Typically we would
rename the variable: variable shadowing is a necessary part
of Java syntax, but is not a useful programming technique.
Your code will be easier to understand if you avoid shadowed
variables.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
So, how can we refer to the radius variable defined in the
<tt class=literal>Circle</tt> class when we need it?  Recall that using a
variable, such as <tt class=literal>r</tt>, in the class in which it is
defined is shorthand for:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
this.r  // Refers to the GraphicCircle resolution variable.
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
As you might guess, you can refer to a variable <tt class=literal>r</tt>
defined in the superclass like this:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
super.r  // Refers to the Circle radius variable.
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Another way you can do this is to cast <tt class=literal>this</tt> to the
appropriate class and then access the variable:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
((Circle) this).r
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This cast is exactly what the <tt class=literal>super</tt> keyword does
when used like this.  You can use this casting technique
when you need to refer to a shadowed variable defined in a
class that is not the immediate superclass.  For example, if
<tt class=literal>C</tt> is a subclass of <tt class=literal>B</tt>, which is a subclass of
<tt class=literal>A</tt>, and class <tt class=literal>C</tt> shadows a variable <tt class=literal>x</tt>
that is also defined in classes <tt class=literal>A</tt> and <tt class=literal>B</tt>, then you
can refer to these different variables from class <tt class=literal>C</tt>
as follows: 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
x                // Variable x in class C.
this.x           // Variable x in class C.
super.x          // Variable x in class B.
((B)this).x      // Variable x in class B.
((A)this).x      // Variable x in class A.
super.super.x    // Illegal; does not refer to x in class A.
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Note that you cannot refer to a shadowed variable <tt class=literal>x</tt>
in the superclass of a superclass with
<tt class=literal>super.super.x</tt>. Java does not recognize this syntax.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-6.9">Shadowed Methods?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Just as a variable defined in one class can shadow a
variable with the same name in a superclass, you might
expect that a method in one class could shadow a method with
the same name (and same arguments) in a superclass.  In a
sense, they do: "shadowed" methods are called overridden
methods.  But method overriding is significantly different
than variable shadowing; it is discussed in the sections
that follow.
