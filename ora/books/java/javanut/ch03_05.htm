<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-5">3.5 Object Destruction</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.GARBAGE.COLL1"></A>Now that we've seen how you can create and use objects, the
next obvious question, a question that C and C++ programmers have
been itching to have answered, is how do you destroy
objects when they are no longer needed?

<p class=para>
The answer is: You don't!  Objects are not passed to any
<tt class=literal>free()</tt> method, as allocated memory in C is.  And
there is no <tt class=literal>delete</tt> operator as there is in C++.
Java takes care of object destruction for you, and lets you
concentrate on other, more important things, like the
algorithm you're working on.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-5.1">Garbage Collection</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The technique Java uses to get rid of objects once they are
no longer needed is called <i class=emphasis>garbage collection</I>.  It is
a technique that has been around for years in languages such
as Lisp.  The Java interpreter knows what objects it has
allocated.  It can also figure out which variables refer to
which objects, and which objects refer to which other
objects.  Thus, it can figure out when an allocated object
is no longer referred to by any other object or variable.
When it finds such an object, it knows that it can destroy
it safely, and does so.  The garbage collector can also
detect and destroy "cycles" of objects that refer to each
other, but are not referred to by any other objects.

<p class=para>
The Java garbage collector runs as a low-priority thread,
and does most of its work when nothing else is going on.
Generally, it runs during idle time while waiting for
user input in the form of keystrokes or mouse events.
The only time the garbage collector must run while something
high-priority is going on (i.e., the only time it will
actually slow down the system) is when the interpreter has
run out of memory.  This doesn't happen often because there
is that low-priority thread cleaning things up in the
background.

<p class=para>
This scheme may sound extremely slow and wasteful of memory.
Actually though, good garbage collectors can be
surprisingly efficient.  No, garbage collection will never
be as efficient as explicit, well-written memory allocation
and deallocation.  But it does make programming a lot easier
and less prone to bugs.  And for most real-world programs,
rapid development, lack of bugs, and easy maintenance are
more important features than raw speed or memory efficiency.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-5.2">Putting the Trash Out</A></h3>

<p class=para>
What garbage collection means for your programs is that when
you are done with an object, you can just forget about
it--the garbage collector finds it and takes care of it.
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-7">Example 3.7</A>
shows an example.

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-EX-7">Example 3.7: Leaving an Object Out for Garbage Collection</A></h4>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
String processString(String s)
{
    // Create a StringBuffer object to process the string in.
    StringBuffer b = new StringBuffer(s);
    // Process it somehow...
    // Peturn it as a String. Just forget about the StringBuffer object:
    // it will be automatically garbage collected.
    return b.toString();
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
If you're a C or C++ programmer, conditioned to allocating and
deallocating your own dynamic memory, you may at first feel
a nagging sense of misgiving when you write procedures that
allocate and then forget objects.  You'll get used to it
though, and even learn to love it!

<p class=para>
There is an instance where you may want to take some action
to help the garbage collection process along by "forgetting
quickly."
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-8">Example 3.8</A>
explains.

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-EX-8">Example 3.8: Forced Forgetting of an Object</A></h4>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public static void main(String argv[]) 
{
    int big_array[] = new int[100000];
    // Do some computations with big_array and get a result.
    int result = compute(big_array);
    // We no longer need big_array.  It will get garbage collected when 
    // there are no more references.  Since big_array is a local variable, 
    // it refers to the array until this method returns.  But this 
    // method doesn't return.  So we've got to get rid of the reference 
    // ourselves, just to help out the garbage collector.
    big_array = null;
    // Loop forever, handling the user's input.
    for(;;) handle_input();
}

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-SECT-5.3">Object Finalization</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH3.OBJECTS2"></A><a name="CH3.FINALIZER.ME1"></A>Just as a constructor method performs initialization for an
object, a Java <i class=emphasis>finalizer</I> method performs
finalization for an object.

<p class=para>
Garbage collection automatically frees up the memory
resources used by objects.  But objects may hold other kinds
of resources, such as file descriptors or sockets, as well.
The garbage collector can't free these resources up for you,
so you should write a finalizer method that takes care
of things like closing open files, terminating network
connections, and so on.

<p class=para>
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-9">Example 3.9</A>
shows the finalizer method from the Java <tt class=literal>FileOutputStream</tt>
class. 

<p class=para>
Note that a finalizer is an instance method
(i.e., non-<tt class=literal>static</tt>), takes no arguments, returns no
value (i.e., <tt class=literal>void</tt>), and must be named
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt>.
[6]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[6] 
C++ programmers, take note!  Although Java constructor
methods are named like C++ constructors, Java finalization
methods are not named like C++ destructor methods.
</blockquote>
<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-3-EX-9">Example 3.9: A Finalizer Method</A></h4>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
/**
 * Closes the stream when garbage is collected.
 * Checks the file descriptor first to make sure it is not already closed.
 */
protected void finalize() throws IOException {
    if (fd != null) close();
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
There are some additional things to be aware of about finalizers:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>If an object has a finalizer, that method is invoked before
the system garbage collects the object.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The Java interpreter may exit without garbage collecting all
outstanding objects, so some finalizers may never be invoked.
In this case, though, any outstanding resources are usually
freed by the operating system.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Java makes no guarantees about when garbage collection will
occur, or what order objects will be collected in.
Therefore, Java can make no guarantees about when a
finalizer will be invoked, or in what order finalizers will be
invoked, or what thread will execute finalizers.

<p>
<li class=listitem>After a finalizer is invoked, objects are not freed right away.
This is because a finalizer method may "resurrect" an object
by storing the <tt class=literal>this</tt> pointer somewhere, so that the
object once again has references.  Thus, after
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> is called, an object must once again be
determined to be unreferenced before it can actually be garbage
collected.  Even if an object is "resurrected," the
finalizer method is never invoked more than once.  Note that
resurrecting an object is never a useful thing to do--just a
strange quirk of object finalization.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The finalizer shown in
<a href="#JNUT2-CH-3-EX-9">Example 3.9</A>
declares that it may throw an exception (exceptions are
described in detail in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>How Java Differs from C</i></A>).  If an uncaught
exception actually occurs in a finalizer method, however,
the exception is
ignored by the system.
