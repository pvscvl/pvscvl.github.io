<p class=para>
<a name="CH4.APIS.APPLIC1"></A><a name="CH4.JAVABEANS.AP1"></A>JavaBeans is a "software component model" for Java that has
generated quite a lot of interest from many quarters.  The
JavaBeans API specification defines "beans" as follows: "A
Java Bean is a reusable software component that can be
manipulated visually in a builder tool."  The
<tt class=literal>java.beans</tt> package defines classes and interfaces
designed to work with beans at three distinct levels,
described below.

<p class=para>
Much of the JavaBeans API is intended for use only by those
few people who are writing interface builder tools that
manipulate beans.  The main thing that a builder tool needs
to be able to do with beans is "introspect" on them--i.e., to
determine what properties are exposed by a bean, what
methods it exports, and what events it can generate.  This
is information that a builder tool must be able to display
to the programmer who is using the tool.  The JavaBeans API
defines a set of naming conventions for the methods that a
bean defines.  If a bean follows these conventions, a
builder tool can use the new Reflection API to determine
what properties, methods, and events the bean supports.  The
<tt class=literal>Introspector</tt> class uses reflection to obtain
information about a bean and presents it to the builder
tool in the form of a <tt class=literal>BeanInfo</tt> object, which itself
contains various <tt class=literal>FeatureDescriptor</tt> objects
describing the properties, methods, and events of the bean.

<p class=para>
At the second level, the JavaBeans API contains classes and
interfaces intended for use by programmers who are creating
beans for others to use. <a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, <i>Java Beans</i></A>
describes how to use the classes in <tt class=literal>java.beans</tt> in this manner.
One of the surprising features of
the JavaBeans API is that there is no <tt class=literal>Bean</tt> class that
all beans must extend.  A bean can be of any class; however,
as we've seen, beans should follow certain naming
conventions.  The <tt class=literal>java.beans</tt> classes that a bean
creator uses are generally auxiliary classes, used not by
the bean, but by the builder tool that manipulates the bean.
These auxiliary classes are shipped with a bean, and
provide additional information or methods that a builder
tool may use with the bean.  These classes are not
included in finished software built with the bean.

<p class=para>
For example, one of the auxiliary classes a bean may define
is a custom <tt class=literal>BeanInfo</tt> class to provide information to
the builder tool that is not available through the
Reflection API.  This information might include a
human-readable description of the bean's properties,
methods, and events, for example.  Or, if a bean does not
follow the standard naming conventions, this custom
<tt class=literal>BeanInfo</tt> class must also provide more basic
information about the bean's properties, methods, and
events.

<p class=para>
Besides a <tt class=literal>BeanInfo</tt> class, complex beans may also
provide a <tt class=literal>Customizer</tt> class and one or more
<tt class=literal>PropertyEditor</tt> classes.  A <tt class=literal>Customizer</tt> class
is a kind of configuration tool or "wizard" for a bean.  It
is instantiated by the builder tool in order to guide the
user through bean customization.  A <tt class=literal>PropertyEditor</tt>
class is used to allow the user to edit the value of bean
properties of a particular class.  Builder tools have
built-in property editors for common types such as strings,
colors, and fonts, but a bean that has properties of some
unusual or custom type may want to provide a
<tt class=literal>PropertyEditor</tt> subclass to allow the user to easily
specify values for those properties.

<p class=para>
The third level at which the JavaBeans API can be used is by programmers
who are assembling an application using beans.  Some
programmers may do this through a builder tool, while others
may do it "by hand", the old-fashioned way.  Programmers
using beans do not typically have to use the
<tt class=literal>java.beans</tt> package.  At this level, it is more a
matter of reading the documentation for the particular beans
being used and following those instructions.  Nevertheless,
a programmer using beans does need to be familiar with the
event model used by beans, which is the same as the Java 1.1
event model for AWT.  Also, programmers using beans "by
hand" should be familiar with the naming conventions for
bean properties, methods, and events, in order to more
easily understand how a given bean can be used.  In Java
1.1, all AWT components are beans and follow these naming
conventions.
