<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-4-SECT-5">4.5 Other AWT Improvements</A></h2>

<p class=para>
In addition to the major change in the AWT event model,
there have been quite a few other improvements to the AWT.
These improvements are summarized in the sections below.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-4-SECT-5.1">Printing</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Printing in Java 1.1 is implemented through the new
<tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt> class and <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt> interface.
The <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt> class represents a print request.
When a <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt> object is created, the user is
prompted with a platform-dependent print dialog, which
allows her to specify options such as which printer to use.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>getGraphics()</tt> method of a <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt>
object returns a <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object that can be used for
printing.  This object is an instance of a subclass of
<tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> that knows how to print in a
platform-dependent way.  The object also implements the
<tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt> interface.  To print a component, you
simply pass this <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object to the component's
<tt class=literal>print()</tt> method.  If the component does not define
this method, the default implementation simply
invokes the <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> method, which usually does the
right thing.  When you want to print a component and all of
its subcomponents, you can simply pass the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object
to the <tt class=literal>printAll()</tt> method of the component.

<p class=para>
Printing multiple pages is more complex, of course.  The
application is responsible for pagination of the output, and
in order to draw the output on the page the application may
also need to query the <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt> object to determine
the page size (in pixels) and page resolution (in pixels per
inch).

<p class=para>
For security reasons, applets are not allowed to initiate
print jobs; if they were, you could expect to see applets on
the Net that automatically printed hardcopy advertisements to
your printer!  Note, however, that this does not mean that
applets cannot print
themselves when the browser or applet viewer initiates the
print request object and invokes the <tt class=literal>printAll()</tt> method
of the applet.

<p class=para>
<a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, <i>New AWT Features</i></A> contains an example that uses
the printing capabilities of Java 1.1.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-4-SECT-5.2">Cut-and-Paste</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Data transfer via the cut-and-paste metaphor is supported in
Java 1.1 by the classes and interfaces in the
<tt class=literal>java.awt.datatransfer</tt> package.  One half of this
package provides generic data-transfer functionality, and
the other half provides the classes and interfaces needed
for clipboard-based cut-and-paste.  In future versions of
the JDK, we can expect to see support for the drag-and-drop
data transfer metaphor added to this package.

<p class=para>
For the purposes of data transfer, the <tt class=literal>DataFlavor</tt>
class represents the notion of a data type or data format.
A <tt class=literal>DataFlavor</tt> consists of a human-readable name for
the flavor and one of two possible machine-readable format definitions.  The
first of the machine-readable descriptions is a <tt class=literal>String</tt>
that specifies a MIME type for the transferred data. The second
is a <tt class=literal>Class</tt> object that represents a
Java class.  When a <tt class=literal>DataFlavor</tt> is specified with a
<tt class=literal>Class</tt> object, it is an instance of this class that
is passed when data transfer actually occurs.

<p class=para>
Any value that can be transferred through the Java 1.1 data
transfer mechanism must be represented by a class that
implements the <tt class=literal>Transferable</tt> interface.  This
interface defines methods to query the data flavors that the
class supports, and it defines a method that the data transfer
mechanism calls to convert the transferable value into the
appropriate form for a given <tt class=literal>DataFlavor</tt>.

<p class=para>
While the <tt class=literal>DataFlavor</tt> class and the
<tt class=literal>Transferable</tt> interface define the fundamental data
transfer mechanism, they, by themselves, are not enough to
initiate or perform data transfer.  For this purpose,
<tt class=literal>java.awt.datatransfer</tt> also defines the
<tt class=literal>Clipboard</tt> class and the <tt class=literal>ClipboardOwner</tt>
interface.  Together, they support a cut-and-paste metaphor
for data transfer.  Because strings are often transferred
between applications, <tt class=literal>java.awt.datatransfer</tt> provides
the <tt class=literal>StringSelection</tt> class.  This class implements
both the <tt class=literal>Transferable</tt> and the <tt class=literal>ClipboardOwner</tt>
interfaces and makes it very easy to transfer textual data
through cut-and-paste.

<p class=para>
Inter-application data
transfer is performed through the system clipboard.  It is
also possible to perform intra-application transfers through
a private clipboard that an application creates for itself.
Note that untrusted applets are not allowed to access the
system clipboard--there could be sensitive information
contained on it that untrusted code should not have access
to.  This means that applets cannot participate in
inter-application cut-and-paste. <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, <i>New AWT Features</i></A>
provides an example that demonstrates intra-application
cut-and-paste data transfer.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-4-SECT-5.3">Popup Menus and Menu Shortcuts</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Java 1.1 adds support for popup menus to the
AWT.  The <tt class=literal>PopupMenu</tt> class is a subclass of
<tt class=literal>Menu</tt>; menu items are added to it just as they
are added to regular pulldown menus.  A popup menu can be
attached to an arbitrary AWT component, using the new
<tt class=literal>add()</tt> method of the <tt class=literal>Component</tt> class.  And,
finally, a popup menu can be "popped up" by calling its
<tt class=literal>show()</tt> method. (The menu pops itself down
automatically.)

<p class=para>
An application typically displays a popup menu when the
user clicks a certain mouse button over the component that
the menu is attached to.  However, different platforms
traditionally use different mouse buttons to display popup
menus.  You can use the new <tt class=literal>isPopupTrigger()</tt> method
of <tt class=literal>MouseEvent</tt> to determine whether a given mouse click has the
appropriate modifiers set to trigger the popup menu for the
current platform.

<p class=para>
Java 1.1 also adds support for menu shortcut keys.  The new
<tt class=literal>MenuShortcut</tt> class represents a menu shortcut key.
An instance of this class may optionally be specified
whenever you create a <tt class=literal>MenuItem</tt> object.  Again, different
platforms use different modifier keys to invoke menu
shortcuts, so when you create a <tt class=literal>MenuShortcut</tt> object,
you specify only the key in question (plus, optionally, the
<b>Shift</b> key).  The system translates this into a
platform-dependent shortcut using <b>Ctrl</b>, <b>Alt</b>, or
some other modifier key.

<p class=para>
The example in <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, <i>New AWT Features</i></A> demonstrates both a popup menu and menu shortcuts.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-4-SECT-5.4">Keyboard Focus Traversal</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The ability to operate a GUI without using the mouse is an
important feature of any windowing toolkit.  The addition of
menu shortcuts in Java 1.1 is an important step in this
direction.  Java 1.1 also adds rudimentary facilities for
keyboard focus traversal (i.e., moving keyboard focus among
the individual components in a window) using the <b>Tab</b>
and <b>Shift-Tab</b> keys.

<p class=para>
Under the new focus traversal scheme, components within a
container are traversed in the order in which they were
added to the container.  (Note, however, that it is possible
to override this order by specifying an explicit position
within the container's component list for a new component as
it is added to the container with the <tt class=literal>add()</tt> method.)
Beyond adding components to their container in the order
desired for traversal, nothing else is required of the
programmer in order to make keyboard focus traversal work.

<p class=para>
If you are creating a custom component that can accept
keyboard focus, you should override the
<tt class=literal>isFocusTraversable()</tt> method to return <tt class=literal>true</tt>.
The component should call the <tt class=literal>requestFocus()</tt> method
it inherits from <tt class=literal>Component</tt> when the user clicks on
it or otherwise activates it.  Finally, when a component
receives focus, (i.e., when its <tt class=literal>processFocusEvent()</tt>
method is invoked), it should provide some sort of visual
indication, such as a highlighted border, that it has the
focus.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-4-SECT-5.5">Miscellaneous Improvements</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>SystemColor</tt> class
represents a color used by the desktop system.  On some
platforms, these colors may be dynamically updated while the
system is running.  The <tt class=literal>SystemColor</tt> class also
implements quite a few constants that represent system
colors for various GUI components.  Thus, if you want your
GUIs to match the desktop color scheme, you might create
them using colors such as <tt class=literal>SystemColor.menu</tt> (the
background color for menus) and <tt class=literal>SystemColor.menuText</tt>
(foreground color for menus), for example.

<p class=para>
The treatment of fonts has been changed and improved
somewhat in Java 1.1.  The use of the font names
"TimesRoman," "Helvetica," and "Courier" is now discouraged.
Instead, you should use "serif," "sansserif," and
"monospaced"--these names convey the essential style of the
font face, without specifying the exact font to be used.
The font names "Dialog" and "DialogInput" are still
supported in Java 1.1.  An important reason for switching to
generic font names is that Java can now display any Unicode
character for which there is an appropriate font installed
on the host system.  The names "serif" and "sansserif" have
meaning even when applied to non-Latin character sets, such
as Japanese Kanji characters; the names "timesroman" and
"helvetica" clearly do not.  Another result of this fuller
Unicode support is that the use of the "ZapfDingbats" font
is also discouraged.  Instead, regardless of what font you
are using, you can simply encode these graphical symbols
using Unicode characters between <tt class=literal>\u2700</tt> and
<tt class=literal>\u27ff</tt>.  (See <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, <i>Internationalization</i></A>
for an example.) This improved support for Unicode makes it
much easier to write internationalized programs in Java.

<p class=para>
In Java 1.0, mouse cursors could only be specified for a
<tt class=literal>Frame</tt>.  In Java 1.1, every component can have a its
own cursor, represented by the new <tt class=literal>Cursor</tt> object.
There are new methods of <tt class=literal>Component</tt> for setting and
querying the cursor.  This change does not add any new
predefined cursor images, nor does it add the ability to
create custom cursors; it merely allows you to specify a
cursor for any arbitrary component, and to do so in a more
logical fashion.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>ScrollPane</tt> class is new in Java 1.1.  It is a
<tt class=literal>Container</tt> that makes it very easy to scroll a large
component or GUI within a smaller visible area.  Doing this
in Java 1.0 required a custom container, and suffered from
some serious performance problems. <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, <i>New AWT Features</i></A> shows the use
of a <tt class=literal>ScrollPane</tt> object.

<p class=para>
Another new feature is the ability to
create "lightweight components."  These are components and
containers that do not have a native window of their own.
In Java 1.0, custom components and containers had to be
subclassed from <tt class=literal>Canvas</tt> or <tt class=literal>Panel</tt>.  In Java
1.1, however, you can subclass <tt class=literal>Component</tt> and
<tt class=literal>Container</tt> directly.  Doing so creates a simpler component or
container, without the overhead of a native window.  It also
allows you to create partially transparent components that
appear non-rectangular.

<p class=para>
Java 1.1 also includes several miscellaneous changes to
clipping and image manipulation:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>The <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> class defines a method to set an
arbitrary clipping rectangle, even to one that is larger
than the current clipping region.  There is also a new
method to query the current clipping region.

<p>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> also defines two new <tt class=literal>drawImage()</tt>
methods that are more flexible than the existing
<tt class=literal>drawImage()</tt> methods.  These new methods allow
arbitrary image cropping, scaling, and flipping.

<p>
<li class=listitem>There are two new classes, <tt class=literal>ReplicateScaleFilter</tt> and
<tt class=literal>AreaAveragingScaleFilter</tt>, that can be used to scale
an image as it is loaded, and a new convenience method, 
<tt class=literal>Image.getScaledInstance()</tt>, to obtain a new
<tt class=literal>Image</tt> object that contains a scaled version of some
other <tt class=literal>Image</tt>.

<p>
<li class=listitem>New methods have been added to the <tt class=literal>MemoryImageSource</tt>
class that allow images generated from memory to be
dynamically and efficiently updated, allowing a kind of
image animation.

<p>
<li class=listitem>New methods have been added to the <tt class=literal>PixelGrabber</tt>
class to make it more efficient and flexible to use.
