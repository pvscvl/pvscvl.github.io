<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-7">2.7 Reference Data Types</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="REFERENCE-DATA-TYPES"></A><a name="DATA-TYPES2"></A>The non-primitive data types in Java are objects and arrays.
These non-primitive types are often called "reference types"
because they are handled "by reference"--in other words, 
the address of the object or array is stored in a variable, 
passed to methods, and so on.  By comparison, primitive types 
are handled "by value"--the actual primitive values are stored
in variables and passed to methods.

<p class=para>
In C, you can manipulate a value by reference by taking its
address with the <tt class=literal>&amp;</tt> operator, and you can "dereference"
an address with the <tt class=literal>*</tt> and <tt class=literal>-&gt;</tt> operators.
These operators do not exist in Java: primitive types are
always passed by value; arrays and objects are always
passed by reference.

<p class=para>
Because objects are passed by reference, two different
variables may refer to the same object:

<p class=para>
<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
Button p, q;
p = new Button();           // p refers to a Button object.
q = p;                      // q refers to the same Button.
p.setLabel("Ok");           // A change to the object through p...
String s = q.getLabel();    // ...is also visible through q.  
                            // s now contains "Ok."
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This is not true of primitive types, however:

<p class=para>
<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
int i = 3;                  // i contains the value 3.
int j = i;                  // j contains a copy of the value in i.
i = 2;                      // Changing i doesn't change j.
                            // Now, i == 2 and j == 3.
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-7.1">Terminology: Pass by Reference</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The statement that Java manipulates objects "by reference"
causes confusion for some programmers, because there are
several different meanings of "by reference" in common use.
Regardless of what we call it, it is important to understand
what Java does.  Java works with references to objects.  A
Java variable holds only a reference to an object, not the
object itself.  When an object is passed to a method,
only a reference to the object is actually passed, not the
entire object.  It is in this sense that Java manipulates
objects "by reference."

<p class=para>
Some people use the term "pass by reference" to mean that a
reference to a variable is passed to a method.  Java
does not do this.  For example, it is <i class=emphasis>not</I> possible to
write a working <tt class=literal>swap()</tt> function like the following
in Java:

<p class=para>
<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public void swap(Object a, Object b) {
  Object temp = a;
  a = b;
  b = temp;
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The method parameters <tt class=literal>a</tt> and <tt class=literal>b</tt> contain
references to objects, not addresses of variables.  Thus,
while this <tt class=literal>swap()</tt> function does compile and run, it
has no effect except on its own local variables and
arguments.

<p class=para>
To solve this terminology problem, perhaps we should say
that Java manipulates objects "by reference," but it passes
object references to methods "by value."

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-7.2">Copying Objects</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Because reference types are not passed by value, assigning
one object to another in Java does not copy the value of the
object.  It merely assigns a reference to the object.
Consider the following code:

<p class=para>
<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
Button a = new Button("Okay");
Button b = new Button("Cancel");
a = b;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
After these lines are executed, the variable <tt class=literal>a</tt>
contains a reference to the object that <tt class=literal>b</tt> refers
to.  The object that <tt class=literal>a</tt> used to refer to is lost.

<p class=para>
To copy the data of one object into another object, use the
<tt class=literal>clone()</tt> method:

<p class=para>
<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
Vector b = new Vector;
c = b.clone();
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
After these lines run, the variable <tt class=literal>c</tt> refers to an
object that is a duplicate of the object referred to by <tt class=literal>b</tt>.
Note that not all types support the <tt class=literal>clone()</tt> method.
Only classes that implement the <tt class=literal>Cloneable</tt> interface
may be cloned.
For more information on cloning objects,
look up <tt class=literal>java.lang.Cloneable</tt> and
<tt class=literal>java.lang.Object.clone()</tt> in <a href="ch25_01.htm">Chapter 25, <i>The java.lang Package</i></A>.

<p class=para>
Arrays are also reference types, and assigning an array simply
copies a reference to the array.  To actually copy the
values stored in an array, you must assign each of the
values individually or use the <tt class=literal>System.arraycopy()</tt>
method.  

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-7.3">Checking Objects for Equality</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Another implication of passing objects by reference is that
the <tt class=literal>==</tt> operator tests whether two variables refer to
the same object, not whether two objects contain the same
values.  To actually test whether two separate objects are
the same, you must use a specially written method for that
object type (just as you might use <tt class=literal>strcmp()</tt> to
compare C strings
for equality).  In Java, a number of
classes define an <tt class=literal>equals()</tt> method that you can use
to perform this test.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-7.4">Java Has No Pointers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The referencing and dereferencing of objects is handled
for you automatically by Java. Java does not allow you to
manipulate pointers or memory addresses of any kind:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>It does not allow you to cast object or array references
into integers or vice-versa.

<p>
<li class=listitem>It does not allow you to do pointer arithmetic.

<p>
<li class=listitem>It does not allow you to compute the size in bytes of any
primitive type or object.

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
There are two reasons for these restrictions:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Pointers are a notorious source of bugs.  Eliminating them
simplifies the language and eliminates many potential bugs.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Pointers and pointer arithmetic could be used to sidestep
Java's run-time checks and security mechanisms.  Removing
pointers allows Java to provide the security guarantees that
it does.

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
To a C programmer, the lack of pointers and pointer
arithmetic may seem an odious restriction in Java.  But once
you get used to the Java object-oriented programming model,
it no longer seems like a serious restriction at all.  The
lack of pointers does mean that you probably can't do things
like write UNIX device drivers in Java (at least not without
using native methods written in C).  But big deal--most of
us never have to do this kind of low-level programming
anyway.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-7.5">null</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The default value for variables of all reference types is
<tt class=literal>null</tt>.  <tt class=literal>null</tt> is a reserved value that
indicates "an absence of reference"--i.e., that a variable
does not refer to any object or array.

<p class=para>
In Java, <tt class=literal>null</tt> is a reserved keyword, unlike
<tt class=literal>NULL</tt> in C, where it is just a constant defined to be 0.
<tt class=literal>null</tt> is an exception to the strong typing rules of
Java--it may be assigned to any variable of reference type
(i.e., any variable which has a class, interface, or array as
its type).

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>null</tt> can't be cast to any primitive type, including
integral types and <tt class=literal>boolean</tt>.  It shouldn't be
considered equal to zero (although it may be
implemented this way).

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JNUT2-CH-2-SECT-7.6">Reference Type Summary</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The distinction between primitive types passed by value, and
objects and arrays passed by reference is a crucial one in
Java.  Be sure you understand the following:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>All objects and arrays are handled by reference in Java.
(Those object references are passed-by-value to methods,
however.)

<p>
<li class=listitem>The <tt class=literal>=</tt> and <tt class=literal>==</tt> operators assign and test
references to objects.  Use <tt class=literal>clone()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>equals()</tt> to actually copy or test the objects themselves.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The necessary referencing and dereferencing of objects and
arrays is handled automatically by Java.

<p>
<li class=listitem>A reference type can never be cast to a primitive type.

<p>
<li class=listitem>A primitive type can never be cast to a reference type.

<p>
<li class=listitem>There is no pointer arithmetic in Java.

<p>
<li class=listitem>There is no <tt class=literal>sizeof</tt> operator in Java.

<p>
<li class=listitem><tt class=literal>null</tt> is a special value that means "no object" or
indicates an absence of reference.
