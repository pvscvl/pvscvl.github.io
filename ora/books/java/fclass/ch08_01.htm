The <tt class=literal>java.net</tt> package provides two basic mechanisms
for accessing data and other resources over a network.  The
fundamental mechanism is called a socket. A socket allows programs to
exchange groups of bytes called packets. There are a number of classes
in <tt class=literal>java.net</tt> that support sockets, including
<tt class=literal>Socket</tt>, <tt class=literal>ServerSocket</tt>,
<tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt>, <tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>MulticastSocket</tt>. The
<tt class=literal>java.net</tt> package also includes a
<tt class=literal>URL</tt> class that provides a higher-level mechanism
for accessing and processing data over a network.

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JFC-CH-8-SECT-1">8.1 Sockets</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH08.NET1"></A><a name="CH08.NET1A"></A>A socket is a mechanism that allows programs to send packets of bytes
to each other. The programs do not need to be running on the same
machine, but if they are running on different machines, they do need
to be connected to a network that allows the machines to exchange
data. Java's socket implementation is based on the socket
library that was originally part of BSD UNIX. Programmers who are
familiar with UNIX sockets or the Microsoft WinSock library should be
able to see the similarities in the Java implementation.

<p class=para>
When a program creates a socket, an identifying number called a port
number is associated with the socket. Depending on how the socket is
used, the port number is either specified by the program or assigned
by the operating system. When a socket sends a packet, the packet is
accompanied by two pieces of information that specify the destination
of the packet:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>A network address that specifies the system that should receive the 
packet. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>A port number that tells the receiving system to which socket to deliver 
the data. 

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
Sockets typically work in pairs, where one socket acts as a client and 
the other functions as a server. A server socket specifies the port number 
for the network communication and then listens for data that is sent to 
it by client sockets. The port numbers for server sockets are well-known 
numbers that are known to client programs. For example, an FTP server uses 
a socket that listens at port 21. If a client program wants to communicate 
with an FTP server, it knows to contact a socket that listens at port 21. 

<p class=para>
The operating system normally specifies port numbers for client sockets 
because the choice of a port number is not usually important. When a client 
socket sends a packet to a server socket, the packet is accompanied by 
the port number of the client socket and the client's network address. 
The server is then able to use that information to respond to the client. 

<p class=para>
When using sockets, you have to decide which type of protocol that you 
want it to use to transport packets over the network: a connection-oriented 
protocol or a connectionless protocol. With a connection-oriented protocol, 
a client socket establishes a connection to a server socket when it is 
created. Once the connection has been established, a connection-oriented 
protocol ensures that data is delivered reliably, which means: 

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>For every packet that is sent, the packet is delivered. Every time 
a socket sends a packet, it expects to receive an acknowledgement that 
the packet has been received successfully. If the socket does not receive 
that acknowledgement within the time it expects to receive it, the socket 
sends the packet again. The socket keeps trying until transmission is successful, 
or it decides that delivery has become impossible. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>Packets are read from the receiving socket in the same order that 
they were sent. Because of the way that networks work, packets may arrive 
at the receiving socket in a different order than they were sent. A reliable, 
connection-oriented protocol allows the receiving socket to reorder the 
packets it receives, so that they can be read by the receiving program 
in the same order that they were sent. 

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
A connectionless protocol allows a best-effort delivery of packets. It 
does not guarantee that packets are delivered or that packets are read 
by the receiving program in the same order they were sent. A connectionless 
protocol trades these deficiencies for performance advantages over connection-oriented 
protocols. Here are two types of situations in which connectionless protocols 
are frequently preferred over connection-oriented protocols: 

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>When only a single packet needs to be sent and guaranteed delivery 
is not crucial, a connectionless protocol eliminates the overhead involved 
in creating and destroying a connection. For comparison purposes, the connection-oriented 
TCP/IP protocol uses seven packets to send a single packet, while 
the connectionless UDP/IP protocol uses only one. A protocol for 
getting the current time typically uses a connectionless protocol to request 
the current time from the server and to return the time to the requester. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>For extremely time-sensitive applications, such as sending audio in 
real time, the guarantee of reliable transmission is not an advantage and 
may be a disadvantage. Pausing until a missing piece of data is received 
can cause noticeable clicks or pauses in the audio. Techniques for sending 
audio over a network that use a connectionless protocol have been developed 
and they work noticeably better. For example, RealAudio uses a protocol 
that runs on top of a connectionless protocol to transmit sound over a 
network.

also contains a <tt class=literal>MulticastSocket</tt> 
class that supports connectionless, multicast data communication. 

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JFC-CH-8-SECT-1.1">Sockets for Connection-Oriented Protocols</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH08.CONN1"></A><a name="CH08.CONN3"></A><a name="CH08.CONN2"></A>When you are writing code that implements the server side of a connection-oriented 
protocol, your code typically follows this pattern: 

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Create a <tt class=literal>ServerSocket</tt> 
object to accept connections. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>When the <tt class=literal>ServerSocket</tt> 
accepts a connection, it creates a <tt class=literal>Socket</tt> 
object that encapsulates the connection. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>The <tt class=literal>Socket</tt> is asked to 
create <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> and <tt class=literal>OutputStream</tt> 
objects that read and write bytes to and from the connection. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>The <tt class=literal>ServerSocket</tt> can optionally 
create a new thread for each connection, so that the server can listen 
for new connections while it is communicating with clients. 

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
The code that implements the client side of a connection-oriented
protocol is quite simple. It creates a <tt class=literal>Socket</tt>
object that opens a connection with a server, and then it uses that
<tt class=literal>Socket</tt> object to communicate with the server.

<p class=para>
Now let's look at an example. The example consists of a pair of
programs that allows a client to get the contents of a file from a
server. The client requests the contents of a file by opening a
connection to the server and sending it the name of a file
followed by a newline character. If the server is able to read the
named file, it responds by sending the string
<tt class=literal>"Good:\n"</tt> followed by the contents of the
file. If the server is not able to read the named file, it responds by
sending the string <tt class=literal>"Bad:"</tt> followed by the name of
the file and a newline character. After the server has sent its
response, it closes the connection.

<p class=para>
Here's the program that implements the server side of this file transfer: 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class FileServer extends Thread {
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        ServerSocket s;
        try {
            s = new ServerSocket(1234, 10);
        }catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Unable to create socket");
            e.printStackTrace();
            return;
        }
        try {
            while (true) {
                new FileServer(s.accept());
            }
        }catch (IOException e) {
        }
    }
    private Socket socket; 
    FileServer(Socket s) {
        socket = s;

    }

        FileInputStream f;
        try {
            in = socket.getInputStream();
            out = new PrintStream(socket.getOutputStream());
            fileName = new DataInputStream(in).readLine();
            f = new FileInputStream(fileName);
        }catch (IOException e) {
            if (out != null)
              out.print("Bad:"+fileName+"\n");
            out.close();
            try {
                socket.close();
            }catch (IOException ie) {
            }
            return;
        }
        out.print("Good:\n");
        // send contents of file to client.
        byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
        try {
            int len;
            while ((len = f.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {
                out.write(buffer, 0, len);
            }// while

            try {

                out.close();
                socket.close();
            }catch (IOException e) {
            }
        }
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>FileServer</tt> class implements the server side of
the file transfer; it is a subclass of <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> to
make it easier to write code that can handle multiple connections at
the same time. The <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method provides the
top-level logic for the program. The first thing that
<tt class=literal>main()</tt> does is to create a
<tt class=literal>ServerSocket</tt> object to listen for connections. The
constructor for <tt class=literal>ServerSocket</tt> takes two parameters:
the port number for the socket and a value that specifies the maximum
length of the pending connections queue. The operating system can
accept connections on behalf of the socket when the server program is
busy doing something other than accepting connections. If the second
parameter is greater than zero, the operating system can accept up to
that many connections on behalf of the socket and store them in a
queue. If the second parameter is zero, however, the operating system
does not accept any connections on behalf of the server program. The
remainder of the <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method accepts a
connection, creates a new instance of the
<tt class=literal>FileServer</tt> class to process the connection, and
then waits for the next connection.

<p class=para>
Each <tt class=literal>FileServer</tt> object is responsible for handling
a connection accepted by its <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method. A
<tt class=literal>FileServer</tt> object uses a <tt class=literal>private</tt>
variable, <tt class=literal>socket</tt>, to refer to the
<tt class=literal>Socket</tt> object that allows it to communicate with
the client program on the other end of the connection. The constructor
for <tt class=literal>FileServer</tt> sets its <tt class=literal>socket</tt>
variable to refer to the <tt class=literal>Socket</tt> object that is
passed to it by the <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method and then calls
its <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method. The
<tt class=literal>FileServer</tt> class inherits the
<tt class=literal>start()</tt> method from the <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>
class; the <tt class=literal>start()</tt> method starts a new thread that
calls the <tt class=literal>run()</tt> method. Because the rest of the
connection processing is done asynchronously in a separate thread, the
constructor can return immediately. This allows the
<tt class=literal>main()</tt> method to accept another connection right
away, instead of having to wait for this connection to be fully
processed before accepting another.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>run()</tt> method uses the <tt class=literal>in</tt> and
<tt class=literal>out</tt> variables to refer to
<tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> and <tt class=literal>PrintStream</tt>
objects that read from and write to the connection associated with the
<tt class=literal>Socket</tt> object, respectively.  These streams are
created by calling the <tt class=literal>getInputStream()</tt> and
<tt class=literal>getOutputStream()</tt> methods of the
<tt class=literal>Socket</tt> object. The <tt class=literal>run()</tt> method
then reads the name of the file that the client program wants to
receive and creates a <tt class=literal>FileInputStream</tt> to read that
file. If any of the methods called up to this point have detected a
problem, they throw some kind of <tt class=literal>IOException</tt>.  In
this case, the server sends a response to the client that consists of
the string <tt class=literal>"Bad:"</tt> followed by the filename and then
closes the socket and returns, which kills the thread.

<p class=para>
If everything up to this point has been fine, the server sends the
string <tt class=literal>"Good:"</tt> and then copies the
contents of the file to the socket. The copying is done by repeatedly
filling a buffer with bytes from the file and writing the buffer to
the socket. When the contents of the file are exhausted, the streams
and the socket are closed, the <tt class=literal>run()</tt> method returns,
and the thread dies.

<p class=para>
Now let's take a look at the client part of this program: 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class FileClient {
    private static boolean usageOk(String[] argv) {
        if (argv.length != 2) {
            String msg = "usage is: " + "FileClient server-name file-name";
            System.out.println(msg);
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        int exitCode = 0;
        if (!usageOk(argv))
          return;
        Socket s = null;
        try {
            s = new Socket(argv[0], 1234);
        }catch (IOException e) {
            String msg = "Unable to connect to server";
            System.err.println(msg);
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.exit(1);
        }
        InputStream in = null;
        try {
            OutputStream out = s.getOutputStream();
            new PrintStream(out).print(argv[1]+"\n");
            in = s.getInputStream();
            DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream(in);
            String serverStatus = din.readLine();
            if (serverStatus.startsWith("Bad")) {
                exitCode = 1;
            int ch;
            while((ch = in.read()) &gt;= 0) {
                System.out.write((char)ch);
            }// while
        }catch (IOException e) {
        }finally {
            try {
                s.close();
            }catch (IOException e) {
            }
        }
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>usageOk()</tt> method is simply a utility method
that verifies that the correct number of arguments have been passed to
the client application. It outputs a help message if the number of
arguments is not what is expected. It is generally a good idea to
include a method like this in a Java application that uses
command-line parameters.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method does the real work of
<tt class=literal>FileClient</tt>. After it verifies that it has the
correct number of parameters, it attempts to create a socket connected
to the server program running on the specified host and listening for
connections on port number 1234. The socket that it creates is
encapsulated by a <tt class=literal>Socket</tt> object. The constructor
for the <tt class=literal>Socket</tt> object takes two arguments: the name
of the machine the server program is running on and the port
number. After the socket is successfully opened, the client sends the
specified filename, followed by a new line character, to the
server. The client then gets an <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> from
the socket to read what the server is sending and reads the
success/failure code that the server sends back. If the request is a
success, the client reads the contents of the requested file.

<p class=para>
Note that the <tt class=literal>finally</tt> clause 
at the end closes the socket. If the program did not explicitly close the 
socket, it would be closed automatically when the program terminates. However, 
it is a good programming practice to explicitly close a socket when you 
are done with it.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method of the
<tt class=literal>TimeServer</tt> class begins by creating a
<tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt> object that uses port number
7654. The <tt class=literal>socket</tt> variable refers to this
<tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt>, which is used to communicate with
clients. Then the <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method creates a
<tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> object to contain data received by
the <tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt>.  The two-argument constructor
for <tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> creates objects that
receive data. The first argument is an array of bytes to contain the
data, while the second argument specifies the number of bytes to
read. When a <tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt> is asked to receive a
packet into a <tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt>, only the specified
number of bytes are read. Even though the client is not really sending
any information to the server, we still create a
<tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> with a 1-byte buffer. In theory,
all that the server needs is an empty packet that specifies the
client's network address and port number, but attempting to
receive a zero-byte packet does not work. When the
<tt class=literal>receive()</tt> method of a
<tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt> is called to receive a zero-byte
packet, it returns immediately, rather than waiting for a packet to
arrive. Finally, the server enters an infinite loop that receives
requests from clients using the <tt class=literal>receive()</tt> method of
the <tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt>, and sends responses.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>respond()</tt> method handles sending responses. It
starts by writing the current time as a <tt class=literal>long</tt> value
to an array of bytes. Next, the <tt class=literal>respond()</tt> method
prepares to send the array of bytes by creating a
<tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> object that encapsulates the array
and the address and port number of the client that requested the
time. Notice that the constructor used to create a
<tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> object for sending a packet takes
four arguments: an array of bytes, the number of bytes to send, the
client's network address, and the client's port
number. The address and port are retrieved from the request
<tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> with the
<tt class=literal>getAddress()</tt> and <tt class=literal>getPort()</tt>
methods. The <tt class=literal>respond()</tt> method finishes its work by
actually sending the <tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> using the
<tt class=literal>send()</tt> method of the
<tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt>.

<p class=para>
Now here's the code for the corresponding client program: 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class TimeClient {
    private static boolean usageOk(String[] argv) {
        if (argv.length != 1) {
            String msg = "usage is: " + "TimeClient server-name";
            System.out.println(msg);
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        if (!usageOk(argv))
            System.exit(1);
        DatagramSocket socket;
        try {
            socket = new DatagramSocket();
        }catch (SocketException e) {
            System.err.println("Unable to create socket");
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.exit(1);
            return;
        }
        long time;
        try {
            byte[] buf = new byte[1];
            socket.send(new DatagramPacket(buf, 1, 
                            InetAddress.getByName(argv[0]), 7654));
            DatagramPacket response = new DatagramPacket(new byte[8],8);
            socket.receive(response);
            ByteArrayInputStream bs;
            bs = new ByteArrayInputStream(response.getData());
            DataInputStream ds = new DataInputStream(bs);
            time = ds.readLong();
        }catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.exit(1);
            return;
        }
        System.out.println(new Date(time));
        socket.close();
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method does the real work of
<tt class=literal>TimeClient</tt>. After it verifies that it has the
correct number of parameters with <tt class=literal>usageOk()</tt>, it
creates a <tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt> object for communicating
with the server. Note that the constructor for this
<tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt> does not specify any parameters; a
client <tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt> is not explicitly connected
to a specific port. Then the <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method creates
a <tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> object to contain the request to
be sent to the server. Since this <tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> is
being used to send a packet, the code uses the four-argument
constructor that specifies an array of bytes, the number of bytes to
send, the specified network address for a time server, and the
server's port number.  The <tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> is
then sent to the server with the <tt class=literal>send()</tt> method of
the <tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt>.

<p class=para>
Now the <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method creates another
<tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> to receive the response from the
server. The two-argument constructor is used this time because the
object is being created to receive data. After calling the
<tt class=literal>receive()</tt> method of the
<tt class=literal>DatagramSocket</tt> to get the response from the server,
the <tt class=literal>main()</tt> method gets the data from the response
<tt class=literal>DatagramPacket</tt> by calling
<tt class=literal>getData()</tt>. The data is wrapped in a
<tt class=literal>DataInputStream</tt> so that the data can be read as a
<tt class=literal>long</tt> value. If everything has gone smoothly, the
client finishes by printing the current time and closing the socket.
