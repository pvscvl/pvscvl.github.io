<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JFC-CH-7-SECT-2">7.2 Writing Classes to Work with Serialization</A></h2>

<p class=para>
Writing a class that works with serialization is a bit more
complicated than simply using that class for
serialization. Essentially, an <tt class=literal>ObjectOutputStream</tt>
must write enough of an object's state information so that the
object can be reconstructed. If an object refers to other objects,
those objects must be written, and so on, until all of the objects
the original object refers to, directly or indirectly, are
written. An <tt class=literal>ObjectOutputStream</tt> does not actually
write a <tt class=literal>Class</tt> object that describes an object it is
serializing. Instead, an <tt class=literal>ObjectOutputStream</tt> writes
an <tt class=literal>ObjectStreamClass</tt> object that identifies the
class of the object. Thus, a program that reads a serialized object
must have access to a <tt class=literal>Class</tt> object that describes
the object being deserialized.

<p class=para>
When you are writing a new class, you need to decide whether or not it
should be serializable. Serialization does not make sense for every
class.  For example, a <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> object encapsulates
information that is meaningful only within the process that created
it, so serialization is not appropriate. In order for instances of a
class to be serializable, the class must implement the
<tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> interface. The
<tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> interface does not declare any methods
or variables, so it simply acts as an indicator of
serializability. The <tt class=literal>writeObject()</tt> method of an
<tt class=literal>ObjectOutputStream</tt> throws a
<tt class=literal>NotSerializableException</tt> if it is asked to
serialize an object that does not implement the
<tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> interface.

<p class=para>
The default serialization mechanism is implemented by the
<tt class=literal>writeObject()</tt> method in
<tt class=literal>ObjectOutputStream</tt>.  When an object is serialized,
the class of the object is encoded, along with the class name, the
signature of the class, the values of the
non-<tt class=literal>static</tt> and non-<tt class=literal>transient</tt>
fields of the object, including any other objects referenced by the
object (except those that do not implement the
<tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> interface themselves). Multiple
references to the same object are encoded using a reference-sharing
mechanism, so that a graph of objects can be restored
appropriately. Strings and arrays are objects in Java, so they are
treated as objects during serialization (and deserialization).

<p class=para>
The default deserialization mechanism mirrors the serialization
mechanism.  The default deserialization mechanism is implemented by
the <tt class=literal>readObject()</tt> method in
<tt class=literal>ObjectInputStream</tt>.  When an object is deserialized,
the non-<tt class=literal>static</tt> and non-<tt class=literal>transient</tt>
fields of the object are restored to the values they had when the
object was serialized, including any other objects referenced by the
object (except for those objects that do not implement the
<tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> interface themselves). New object
instances are always allocated during the deserialization process, to
prevent existing objects from being overwritten.  Deserialized objects
are returned as instances of type <tt class=literal>Object</tt>, so they
should be cast to the appropriate type.

<p class=para>
Some classes can simply implement the <tt class=literal>Serializable</tt>
interface and make use of the default serialization and
deserialization mechanisms. However, a class may need to handle two
other issues in order to work with serialization:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>If any of the superclasses of the class do not
implement the <tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> interface, the class
must take care of writing any necessary state information for those
superclasses during serialization and reading the information back
during deserialization.

<p class=para>
When an object is serialized, all of the serializable state
information defined by its class and any superclasses that implement
the <tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> interface is written to the byte
stream. However, any state information defined by superclasses that do
not implement the <tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> interface is not
written to the byte stream.

<p class=para>
When an object is deserialized, the state information defined by its
<tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> superclasses is restored from the byte
stream. By default, the state information for a superclass that does
not implement the <tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> interface is
initialized by called the no-argument constructor for the
superclass. If that superclass does not have a no-argument
constructor, deserialization fails and the
<tt class=literal>readObject()</tt> method throws a
<tt class=literal>NoSuchMethodError</tt>.

<p class=para>
If the objects of a class refer to other objects that are not
<tt class=literal>Serializable</tt>, the class must take care of writing
any necessary state information for the referenced objects during
serialization and reading the information back during deserialization.

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
A class can override the default serialization logic by defining the following 
method: 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream stream) throws IOException
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Now, when an object of the class is serialized, this method is called instead 
of the default mechanism. Note that <tt class=literal>writeObject()</tt> 
is <tt class=literal>private</tt>, so it is not inherited 
by subclasses. The implementation of a <tt class=literal>writeObject()</tt> 
method normally begins by calling the <tt class=literal>defaultWriteObject()</tt> 
method of <tt class=literal>ObjectOutputStream</tt>, 
which implements the default serialization logic. After that, a <tt class=literal>writeObject()</tt> 
method normally goes on to write whatever information is appropriate to 
reconstruct values that are not directly serialized. 

<p class=para>
By the same token, a class can override the default deserialization logic 
by defining the following method: 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream stream)
             throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Now, when an object of the class is deserialized, this method is called 
instead of the default mechanism. <tt class=literal>readObject()</tt> 
is also private and thus not inherited by subclasses. The implementation 
of a <tt class=literal>readObject()</tt> method normally 
begins by calling the <tt class=literal>defaultReadObject()</tt> 
method of <tt class=literal>ObjectInputStream</tt>, 
which implements the default deserialization logic. After that, a <tt class=literal>readObject()</tt> 
method normally goes on to read whatever information is appropriate to 
reconstruct the values that are not directly serialized. 

<p class=para>
Let's take a look at a <tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> 
class that has <tt class=literal>writeObject()</tt> 
and <tt class=literal>readObject()</tt> methods. The 
example below is a partial listing of a class that accesses data using 
a <tt class=literal>RandomAccessFile</tt> object. 
<tt class=literal>RandomAccessFile</tt> objects are 
not <tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> because they 
encapsulate information that is meaningful only on the local system and 
only for a limited amount of time. 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class TextFileReader implements Serializable {
    private transient RandomAccessFile file;
    private String browseFileName;
    ...
    private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream stream) throws IOException{
        stream.defaultWriteObject();
        stream.writeLong(file.getFilePointer());
    }
    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream stream) throws IOException {
        try {
            stream.defaultReadObject();
        }catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            String msg = "Unable to find class";
            if (e.getMessage() != null)
                msg += ": " + e.getMessage();
            throw new IOException(msg);
        }
        file = new RandomAccessFile(browseFileName, "r");
        file.seek(stream.readLong());
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The above example gets around being unable to serialize
<tt class=literal>RandomAccessFile</tt> objects by having enough
information during deserialization to construct a
<tt class=literal>RandomAccessFile</tt> object that is similar to the
original. The name of the file accessed by the
<tt class=literal>RandomAccessFile</tt> object is specified by the
<tt class=literal>browseFileName</tt> variable; this state information is
handled by the default serialization mechanism. In addition, the
<tt class=literal>writeObject()</tt> method writes out the current value
returned by the original <tt class=literal>RandomAccessFile</tt>
object's <tt class=literal>getFilePointer()</tt> method, so that
<tt class=literal>readObject()</tt> can pass that value to the
<tt class=literal>seek()</tt> method of a new
<tt class=literal>RandomAccessFile</tt> object.

<p class=para>
Some sets of objects are more complicated to reconstruct than an instance 
of the above class and its <tt class=literal>RandomAccessFile</tt> 
object. In such cases, the information to reconstruct the objects may be 
spread out over multiple objects in the set. The <tt class=literal>ObjectInputValidation</tt> 
interface provides a way to handle this situation. As the <tt class=literal>readObject()</tt> 
method of <tt class=literal>ObjectInputStream</tt> 
reads a set of objects, it notices which of those objects implement the 
<tt class=literal>ObjectInputValidation</tt> interface. 
After <tt class=literal>readObject()</tt> is done 
reading a set of objects, but before it returns, it calls the <tt class=literal>validateObject()</tt> 
method for each object in the set that implements the <tt class=literal>ObjectInputValidation</tt> 
interface. If one of those methods is unable to properly reconstruct something 
or detects an inconsistency of some sort, it should throw an <tt class=literal>ObjectInvalidException</tt>. 
Note that the order in which the <tt class=literal>validateObject()</tt> 
methods are called is not documented. 

<p class=para>
It is also possible for a class to take complete control over its serialized 
representation, using the <tt class=literal>Externalizable</tt> 
interface. The <tt class=literal>Externalizable</tt> 
interface extends the <tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> 
interface and defines two methods: <tt class=literal>writeExternal()</tt> 
and <tt class=literal>readExternal()</tt>. During 
serialization, if an object implements <tt class=literal>Externalizable</tt>, 
its <tt class=literal>writeExternal()</tt> method 
is called. The <tt class=literal>writeExternal()</tt> 
method is responsible for writing all of the information in the object. 
Similarly, during deserialization, if an object implements <tt class=literal>Externalizable</tt>, 
its <tt class=literal>readExternal()</tt> method is 
called. The <tt class=literal>readExternal()</tt> 
method is responsible for reading all of the information in the object. 
Note that the <tt class=literal>Externalizable</tt> 
mechanism is used instead of, not in addition to, the mechanism for handling 
<tt class=literal>Serializable</tt> objects.
