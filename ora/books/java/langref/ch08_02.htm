<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JLR2-CH-8-SECT-2">8.2 Synchronizing Multiple Threads</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH08.SYNCH1"></A><a name="CH08.SYNCH2"></A>The correct behavior of a multithreaded program generally
depends on multiple threads cooperating with each other. This often
involves threads not doing certain things at the same time or waiting
for each other to perform certain tasks. This type of  cooperation
is called <i class=emphasis>synchronization</I>. This section discusses
some common strategies for synchronization and how they can be implemented
in Java.

<p class=para>
The simplest strategy for ensuring that threads are correctly
synchronized is to write code that works correctly when executed
concurrently by any number of threads. However, this is more easily
said than done. Most useful computations involve doing some activity,
such as updating an instance variable or updating a display, that
must be synchronized in order to happen correctly.

<p class=para>
If a method only updates its local variables and calls other
methods that only modify their local variables, the method can be
invoked by multiple threads without any need for synchronization.
<tt class=literal>Math.sqrt()</tt> and the <tt class=literal>length()</tt>
method of the <tt class=literal>String</tt> class are examples of such
methods.

<p class=para>
A method that creates objects and meets the above criterion
may not require synchronization. If the constructors invoked by
the method do not modify anything but their own local variables
and instance variables of the object they are constructing, and
they only call methods that do not need to be synchronized, the
method itself does not need to be synchronized. An example of such
a method is the <tt class=literal>substring()</tt> in the
<tt class=literal>String</tt> class.

<p class=para>
Beyond these two simple cases, it is impossible to give an
exhaustive list of rules that can tell you whether or not a method
needs to be synchronized. You need to consider what the method is
doing and think about any ill effects of concurrent execution in
order to decide if synchronization is necessary.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JLR-CH-8-SECT-2.1">Single-Threaded Execution</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH08.SING"></A>When more than one thread is trying to update the same data
at the same time, the result may be wrong or inconsistent. Consider
the following example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class CountIt {
    int i = 0;
    void count() {
        i = i + 1;
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The method <tt class=literal>count()</tt> is supposed to increment
the variable <tt class=literal>i</tt> by one. However, suppose that
there are two threads, <tt class=literal>A</tt> and <tt class=literal>B</tt>,
that call <tt class=literal>count()</tt> at the same time. In this case,
it is possible that <tt class=literal>i</tt> could be incremented only
once, instead of twice. Say the value of <tt class=literal>i</tt> is
7. Thread <tt class=literal>A</tt> calls the <tt class=literal>count()</tt>
method and computes <tt class=literal>i+1</tt> as 8. Then thread
<tt class=literal>B</tt>
calls the <tt class=literal>count()</tt> method and computes
<tt class=literal>i+1</tt>
as 8 because thread <tt class=literal>A</tt> has not yet assigned the
new value to <tt class=literal>i</tt>. Next, thread <tt class=literal>A</tt>
assigns the value 8 to the variable <tt class=literal>i</tt>. Finally,
thread <tt class=literal>B</tt> assigns the value 8 to the variable
<tt class=literal>i</tt>. Thus, even though the <tt class=literal>count()</tt>
method is called twice, the variable has only been incremented once
when the sequence is finished.

<p class=para>
Clearly, this code can fail to produce its intended result
when it is executed concurrently by more than one thread. A piece
of code that can fail to produce its intended result when executed
concurrently is called a <i class=emphasis>critical section</I>.
However, a critical section does behave correctly when it is executed
by only one thread at a time. The strategy of single-threaded execution
is to allow only one thread to execute a critical section of code
at a time. If a thread wants to execute a critical section that
another thread is already executing, the thread has to wait until
the first thread is done and no other thread is executing that code
before it can proceed.

<p class=para>
Java provides the <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> statement
and the <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> method modifier for implementing
single-threaded execution. Before executing the block
in a <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt>
statement, the current thread must obtain a lock for the object
referenced by the expression. If
a method is declared with the <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> modifer,
the current thread must obtain a lock before it can invoke the method.
If the method is not declared <tt class=literal>static</tt>, the thread
must obtain a lock associated with the object used to access the
method. If the method is declared <tt class=literal>static</tt>, the
thread must obtain a lock associated with the class in which the
method is declared. Because a thread must obtain a lock before 
executing a <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> method, Java guarantees 
that <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> methods are executed by only 
one thread at a time.

<p class=para>
Modifying the <tt class=literal>count()</tt> method to make it
a <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> method ensures that it works as
intended.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class CountIt {
    int i = 0;
    synchronized void count() {
        i = i + 1;
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The strategy of single-threaded execution can also be used
when multiple methods update the same data. Consider the following
example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class CountIt2 {
    int i = 0;
    void count() {
        i = i + 1;
    }
    void count2() {
        i = i + 2;
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
By the same logic used above, if the <tt class=literal>count()</tt>
and <tt class=literal>count2()</tt> methods are executed concurrently,
the result could be to increment <tt class=literal>i</tt> by 1, 2, or
3. Both the <tt class=literal>count()</tt> and <tt class=literal>count2()</tt>
methods can be declared as <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> to ensure
that they are not executed concurrently with themselves or each
other:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class CountIt2 {
    int i = 0;
    synchronized void count() {
        i = i + 1;
    }
    synchronized void count2() {
        i = i + 2;
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Sometimes it's necessary for a thread to make multiple
method calls to manipulate an object without another thread calling
that object's methods at the same time.
Consider the following example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
System.out.print(new Date());
System.out.print(" : ");
System.out.println(foo());
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If the code in the example is executed concurrently by multiple
threads, the output from the two threads will be interleaved. The
<tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> keyword provides a way to ensure
that only one thread at a time can execute a block of code. Before
executing the block in a <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> statement,
the current thread must obtain a lock for the object referenced
by the expression. The above code can be modified to give a thread
exclusive access to the <tt class=literal>OutputStream</tt> object referenced
by <tt class=literal>System.out</tt>:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
synchronized (System.out) {
    System.out.print(new Date());
    System.out.print(" : ");
    System.out.println(foo());
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Note that this approach only works if other code that wants to call
methods in the same object also uses similar
<tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> statements, or if the methods in
question are all <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> methods. In this
case, the <tt class=literal>print()</tt> and <tt class=literal>println()</tt>
methods are <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt>, so other pieces of code
that need to use these methods do not need to use a
<tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> statement.

<p class=para>
When an inner class is updating fields in its enclosing instance,
simply making a method <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> does not provide the 
needed single-threaded execution. Consider the following code:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class Z extends Frame {
    int pressCount = 0;
    ...
    private class CountButton extends Button
                              implements ActionListener {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
            pressCount ++;
        }
    } 
    ...
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If a <tt class=literal>Z</tt> object instantiates more than one instance 
of <tt class=literal>CountButton</tt>, you need to use single-threaded 
execution to ensure that updates to <tt class=literal>pressCount</tt> 
are done correctly. Unfortunately, declaring the 
<tt class=literal>actionPerformed()</tt> method of 
<tt class=literal>CountButton</tt> to be <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> 
does not accomplish that goal because it only forces the method 
to acquire a lock on the instance of <tt class=literal>CountButton</tt> 
it is associated with before it executes. The object you need to acquire a lock for is the enclosing instance of 
<tt class=literal>Z</tt>. 

<p class=para>
One way to have a <tt class=literal>CountButton</tt> object capture 
a lock on its enclosing instance of <tt class=literal>Z</tt> is to 
update <tt class=literal>pressCount</tt> inside of a 
<tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> statement. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
synchronized (Z.this) {
    pressCount ++;
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The drawback to this approach is that every piece of code that
accesses <tt class=literal>pressCount</tt> in any inner class of 
<tt class=literal>Z</tt> must be in a similar <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> 
statement. Otherwise, it is possible for <tt class=literal>pressCount</tt> to 
be updated incorrectly. The more pieces of code that need to be 
inside of <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> statements, the more places 
there are to introduce bugs in your program.

<p class=para>
A more robust approach is to have the inner class update a field in its
enclosing instance by calling a <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> 
method in the enclosing instance. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class Z extends Frame {
    int pressCount = 0;
    synchronized incrementPressCount() {
        pressCount++;
    } 
    ...
    private class CountButton extends Button
                              implements ActionListener {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
            incrementPressCount();
        } 
    } 
    ...
} 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JLR2-CH-8-SECT-2.2">Optimistic Single-Threaded Execution</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH08.OPT6"></A>When multiple threads are updating a data structure, single-threaded
execution is the obvious strategy to use to ensure correctness of
the operations on the data structure. However, single-threaded execution
can cause some problems of its own. Consider the following example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class Queue extends java.util.Vector {
    synchronized public void put(Object obj) {
        addElement(obj);
    }
    synchronized public Object get() throws EmptyQueueException {
        if (size() == 0)
            throw new EmptyQueueException();
        Object obj = elementAt(0);
        removeElementAt(0);
        return obj;
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This example implements a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue.
If the <tt class=literal>get()</tt> method of a <tt class=literal>Queue</tt>
object is called when the queue is empty, the method throws an exception.
Now suppose that you want to write the <tt class=literal>get()</tt>
method so that when the queue is empty, the method waits for an item
to be put in the queue, rather than throwing an exception. In order
for an item to be put in the queue, the <tt class=literal>put()</tt>
method of the queue must be invoked. But using the single-threaded
execution strategy, the <tt class=literal>put()</tt> method will never
be able to run while the <tt class=literal>get()</tt> method is waiting
for the queue to receive an item. A good way to solve this dilemma
is to use a strategy called <i class=emphasis>optimistic single-threaded execution</I>.

<p class=para>
The optimistic single-threaded execution strategy is similar
to the single-threaded execution strategy. They both begin by getting
a lock on an object to ensure that the currently executing thread
is the only thread that can execute a piece of code, and they both
end by releasing that lock. The difference is what happens in between.
Using the optimistic single-threaded execution strategy, if a piece
of code discovers that conditions are not right to proceed, the
code releases the lock it has on the object that enforces single-threaded
execution and waits. When another piece of code changes things
in such a way that might allow the first piece of code to proceed,
it notifies the first piece of code that it should try to regain
the lock and proceed.

<p class=para>
To implement this strategy, the <tt class=literal>Object</tt>
class provides methods called <tt class=literal>wait()</tt>,
<tt class=literal>notify()</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>notifyAll()</tt>. These methods are inherited
by every other class in Java. The following example shows how to
implement a queue that uses the optimistic single-threaded execution
strategy, so that when the queue is empty, its <tt class=literal>get()</tt>
method waits for the queue to have an item put in it:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class Queue extends java.util.Vector {
    synchronized public void put(Object obj) {
        addElement(obj);
        notify();
    }
    synchronized public Object get() throws EmptyQueueException {
        while (size() == 0)
            wait();
        Object obj = elementAt(0);
        removeElementAt(0);
        return obj;
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
In the above implementation of the <tt class=literal>Queue</tt>
class, the <tt class=literal>get()</tt> method calls <tt class=literal>wait()</tt>
when the queue is empty. The <tt class=literal>wait()</tt> method releases
the lock that excludes other threads from executing methods in the
<tt class=literal>Queue</tt> object, and then waits until another thread
calls the <tt class=literal>put()</tt> method. When <tt class=literal>put()</tt>
is called, it adds an item to the queue and calls <tt class=literal>notify()</tt>.
The <tt class=literal>notify()</tt> method tells a thread that is waiting
to return from a <tt class=literal>wait()</tt> method that it should
attempt to regain its lock and proceed. If there is more than one
thread waiting to regain the lock on the object, <tt class=literal>notify()</tt>
chooses one of the threads arbitrarily. The <tt class=literal>notifyAll()</tt>
method is similar to <tt class=literal>notify()</tt>, but instead of
choosing one thread to notify, it notifies all of the threads that
are waiting to regain the lock on the object.

<p class=para>
Notice that the <tt class=literal>get()</tt> method calls
<tt class=literal>wait()</tt>
inside a <tt class=literal>while</tt> loop. Between the
time that <tt class=literal>wait()</tt>
is notified that it should try to regain its lock and the time
it actually does regain the lock, another thread may have called
the <tt class=literal>get()</tt> method and emptied the queue.
The <tt class=literal>while</tt> loop guards against this situation.

<p class=para>
Sometimes it is necessary to have a thread wait to continue
until another thread has completed its work and died. This type
of synchronization uses the rendezvous strategy. The <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>
class provides the <tt class=literal>join()</tt> method for implementing
this strategy. When the <tt class=literal>join()</tt> method is called
on a <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> object, the method returns immediately
if the thread is dead. Otherwise, the method waits until the thread
dies and then returns.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JLR2-CH-8-SECT-2.4">Balking</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Some methods should not be executed concurrently, and have
a time-sensitive nature that makes postponing calls to them a bad
idea. This is a common situation when software is controlling real-world
devices. Suppose you have a Java program that is embedded in
an electronic control for a toilet. There is a method called
<tt class=literal>flush()</tt>
that is responsible for flushing a toilet, and <tt class=literal>flush()</tt>
can be called from more than one thread. If a thread calls
<tt class=literal>flush()</tt>
while another thread is already executing <tt class=literal>flush()</tt>,
the second call should do nothing. A toilet is capable of only one
flush at a time, and having a concurrent call to the <tt class=literal>flush()</tt>
method result in a second flush would only waste water.

<p class=para>
This scenario suggests the use of the balking strategy. The balking
strategy allows no more than
one thread to execute a method at a time. If another thread attempts
to execute the method, the method simply returns without doing
anything. Here is an example that shows what such a <tt class=literal>flush()</tt>
method might look like:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
boolean busy;
void flush() {
    synchronized (this) {
        if (busy)
            return;
        busy = true;
    }
    // code to make flush happen goes here
    busy = false;
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JLR2-CH-8-SECT-2.5">Explicit Synchronization</A></h3>

<p class=para>
When the synchronization needs of a thread are not known in
advance, you can use a strategy called explicit synchronization.
The explicit synchronization strategy allows you to explicitly tell
a thread when it can and cannot run. For example, you may want an
animation to start and stop in response to external events that
happen at unpredictable times, so you need to be able to tell the
animation when it can run.

<p class=para>
To implement this strategy, the <tt class=literal>Thread</tt>
class provides methods called <tt class=literal>suspend()</tt>
and <tt class=literal>resume()</tt>. You can suspend the execution
of a thread by calling the <tt class=literal>suspend()</tt>
method of the <tt class=literal>Thread</tt> object that controls the
thread. You can later resume execution of the thread by calling
the <tt class=literal>resume()</tt> method on the
<tt class=literal>Thread</tt> object.
