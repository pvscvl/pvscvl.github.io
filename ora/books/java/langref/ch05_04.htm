<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.DEC6"></A>A class declaration creates a reference type in Java. The class
declaration also specifies the implementation of the class, including
its variables, constructors, and methods. The formal definition of a
class declaration is:

<p class=para>
While the above diagram may seem complicated, a class declaration is
really made up of six distinct things:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Optional modifiers that
specify attributes of the class

<p>
<li class=listitem>The keyword <tt class=literal>class</tt>

<p>
<li class=listitem>An identifier that names the class

<p>
<li class=listitem>An optional
<tt class=literal>extends</tt> clause that specifies the superclass
of the declared class

<p>
<li class=listitem>An optional <tt class=literal>implements</tt>
clause that specifies the interfaces implemented by the declared
class

<p>
<li class=listitem>Any number of member declarations, which can
include variables, methods, constructors, static initializers, 
instance initializers, nested top-level classes and interfaces,
and member classes

<p class=para>
The keywords <tt class=literal>public</tt>, <tt class=literal>abstract</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>final</tt> can appear as modifiers at the beginning
of a class declaration. In this situation, these modifiers have the
following meanings:[3]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[3] 
Version 1.0 of Java included a <tt class=literal>private protected</tt>
access specification; this specification has been removed as of version
1.0.2 of the language.
</blockquote>
<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>public</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
If a class is declared <tt class=literal>public</tt>, it can be referenced
by any other class. If the <tt class=literal>public</tt> modifier is not
used, however, the class can only be referenced by other classes in
the same package. A single source file, or compilation unit, can only
declare one <tt class=literal>public</tt> class or interface (see
<a href="ch07_01.htm">Compilation Units</A> for an exception
to this rule).

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>abstract</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
If a class is declared <tt class=literal>abstract</tt>, no instances of
the class may be created. A class declared <tt class=literal>abstract</tt>
may contain <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> methods. Classes not declared
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt> may not contain abstract methods and must
override any <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> methods they inherit with
methods that are not <tt class=literal>abstract</tt>. Furthermore, classes
that implement an interface and are not declared
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt> must contain or inherit methods that are
not <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> that have the same name, number of
parameters, and corresponding parameter types as the methods declared
in the interfaces that the class implements.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>final</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
If a class is declared <tt class=literal>final</tt>, it cannot be
subclassed. In other words, it cannot appear in the
<tt class=literal>extends</tt> clause of another class.

<p class=para>
You want to declare a class <tt class=literal>final</tt>
if it is important to ensure the exact properties and behavior of
that class. Many of the classes in the <tt class=literal>java.lang</tt>
package are declared <tt class=literal>final</tt> for that reason. In
addition, the compiler can often optimize operations
on <tt class=literal>final</tt>
classes. For example, the compiler can optimize operations involving
the <tt class=literal>String</tt> class because it can safely assume
the exact logic of <tt class=literal>String</tt> methods. The compiler
does not have to account for the possibility of methods of a
<tt class=literal>final</tt> class being overridden in a subclass.</DL>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>extends</tt> clause specifies the superclass of the
class being declared. If a class is declared without an
<tt class=literal>extends</tt> clause, the class <tt class=literal>Object</tt>
is its implicit superclass.  The class inherits all of the accessible
methods and variables of its superclass.

<p class=para>
If a class is declared <tt class=literal>final</tt>, it cannot appear in
an <tt class=literal>extends</tt> clause for any other class.

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>implements</tt> clause specifies any interfaces
implemented by the class being declared.  Unless it is an
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt> class, the class (or one of its
superclasses) must define implementations for all of the methods
declared in the interfaces.

Fields are the variables,
methods, constructors, static (load-time) initializers,
instance initializers, nested top-level classes and interfaces,
and member classes that are
declared as part of a class:

<p class=para>
A member declaration causes the member to be defined throughout the
entire class and all of its subclasses. This means that it is not a
problem to have forward references
to members, or in other words, you can use members in a class before
you have defined them. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class foo {
    void doIt() {
        countIt();
    }
    void countIt() {
        i++;
    }
    int i;
}

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.VAR1"></A><a name="CH05.VAR2"></A><a name="CH05.VAR3"></A>A variable that is declared as a member in a class is called a
<i class=emphasis>field variable</I>. A field variable is different
from a local variable, which is declared within a method or a block.

<p class=para>
While the above diagram may seem complicated, a variable declaration
is really made up of four distinct things:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Optional modifiers that specify attributes of the variable.

<p>
<li class=listitem>A type, which can be either a primitive type or a reference type.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Any number of identifiers that name variables. Each name can be
followed by pairs of square brackets to indicate an array variable.

<p>
<li class=listitem>An optional initializer for each variable declared.

<a name="CH05.VARMOD"></A>The modifiers <tt class=literal>public</tt>, <tt class=literal>protected</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>private</tt> can be used in the declaration of a
field variable to specify the accessibility of the variable. In this

<blockquote class=footnote>

Version
1.0 of Java included a <tt class=literal>private protected</tt>
access specification; this specification has been removed as of version

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>public</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A field variable that is declared <tt class=literal>public</tt> is
accessible from any class.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>protected</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A field variable that is declared <tt class=literal>protected</tt> is
accessible to any class that is part of the same package as the class
in which the variable is declared. Such a field variable is also
accessible to any subclass of the class in which it is declared;
this occurs regardless of whether or not the subclass is part of
the same package.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>private</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A field variable that is declared <tt class=literal>private</tt>
is only accessible in the class in which it is declared. Such a
field variable is not accessible to other classes. In particular,
a field variable that is declared <tt class=literal>private</tt> is
not accessible in subclasses of the class in which it is declared.</DL>
<p class=para>
If a field variable is not declared with any of the access modifiers,
the variable has the default accessibility. Default access is often
called "friendly" access because it is similar to
<tt class=literal>friendly</tt> access in C++. A variable with default
access is accessible in any class that is part of the same package as
the class in which the variable is declared. However, a friendly
variable is not accessible to classes outside of the package in which
it is declared, even if the desired classes are subclasses of the class
in which it is declared.

<p class=para>
The keywords <tt class=literal>static</tt>, <tt class=literal>final</tt>,
<tt class=literal>transient</tt>, and <tt class=literal>volatile</tt> can also
be used in the declaration of a field variable. These modifiers have
the following meanings:

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>static</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A field variable that is declared with the <tt class=literal>static</tt>
modifier is called a <i class=emphasis>class variable</I>.
There is exactly one copy of each class variable associated with
the class; every instance of the class shares the single copy of
the class's <tt class=literal>static</tt> variables. Thus, setting the
value of a class variable changes the value of the variable for
all objects that are instances of that class or any of its subclasses.

<p class=para>
For example, if you want to count how many instances of a class
have been instantiated, you can write:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class Foo {
    ...
    static int fooCount = 0;
    Foo() {
        fooCount++;
    }
    ...
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
A field variable that is not declared with the
<tt class=literal>static</tt> modifier is called an <i class=emphasis>instance
variable</I>.  There is a distinct copy of each instance
variable associated with every instance of the class. Thus, setting
the value of an instance variable in one object does not affect the
value of that instance variable in any other object.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>final</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
If a field variable is declared with the <tt class=literal>final</tt>
modifier, the variable is a named constant value. As such, it must
be assigned an initial value.  Any assignment to a
<tt class=literal>final</tt> variable, other than the one that
provides its initial value, is a compile-time error. The initial value
for a <tt class=literal>final</tt> variable is typically 
provided by an initializer that is part of the variable's declaration.
For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
final int X = 4;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
A <tt class=literal>final</tt> field variable that is not initialized 
in its declaration is called a <i class=emphasis>blank final</I>. 
Blank finals are not supported prior to Java 1.1.
A blank final that is declared <tt class=literal>static</tt> must
be assigned a value exactly once in a static initializer. A 
blank final that is not declared <tt class=literal>static</tt>
must be assigned a value exactly once in an instance initializer or
exactly once in each constructor. The compiler
uses flow analysis that takes <tt class=literal>if</tt> statements
and iteration statements into account to ensure that
a blank final is assigned a value
exactly once. Thus, it is possible to have multiple assignments to a blank
final, so long as exactly one of them can be executed. For example,
here is an instance initializer that sets the value of a blank final:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
{
    final int DAYS_IN_YEAR;
    if (isLeapYear(new Date()))
        DAYS_IN_YEAR = 366;
    else
        DAYS_IN_YEAR = 365;
    ...
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Note that the meaning of <tt class=literal>final</tt>
in a variable declaration is very different from the meaning of
<tt class=literal>final</tt> in a method or class declaration. In particular,
if a class contains a <tt class=literal>final</tt> variable, you can
declare a variable with the same name in a subclass of that class
without causing an error.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>transient</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>transient</tt> modifier is used to indicate that a
field variable is not part of the persistent state of an object. The
<tt class=literal>java.io.ObjectOutputStream</tt> class defines
<tt class=literal>write()</tt> methods that output a representation of an
object that can be read later to create a copy of the object.  These
<tt class=literal>write()</tt> methods do not include field variables that
are declared <tt class=literal>transient</tt> in the representation of an
object.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>volatile</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>volatile</tt> modifier is used to tell the compiler
that a field variable will be modified asynchronously by methods that
are running in different threads. Each time the variable is accessed
or set, it is fetched from or stored into global memory in a way that
avoids the assumption that a version of the variable in a cache or a
register is consistent with the version in global memory.</DL>

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="JLR2-CH-5-SECT-4.4.1.2">Variable type</A></h4>

<p class=para>
A field variable declaration must always specify the type of the
variable. If the declaration of a field variable uses a primitive
type, the variable contains a value of the specified primitive
type. If the declaration uses a reference type, the variable contains
a reference to the specified type of object.

<p class=para>
The presence of square brackets in a
variable declaration, after either the type or variable name, indicates
that the variable contains a reference to an array. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
int a[];        // a is an array of int
int[] b;        // b is also an array of int
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
It is also possible to declare a variable to contain an array of
arrays, or more generally, arrays nested to any level. Each pair of
square brackets in the declaration corresponds to a dimension of the
array; it makes no difference whether the brackets appear after the
type or the variable name. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
int[][][] d3;      // Each of these is an array of
int[][] f3[];      // arrays of arrays of integers
int[] g3[][];
int h3[][][];
int[] j3, k3[];    // An array and an array of arrays
</PRE>
</DIV>

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="JLR2-CH-5-SECT-4.4.1.3">Variable name</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The identifier that follows
the variable type is the name of the variable. This identifier can
be used anywhere that the variable is accessible.

<p class=para>
It is an error to declare two field variables with the same name in
the same class. It is also an error to declare a field variable
with the same name as a method declared in the same class or any
of its superclasses.

<p class=para>
If a field variable is declared with the same name as a variable
declared in a superclass, the variable in the superclass is considered
to be <i class=emphasis>shadowed</I>. If a variable is shadowed in a
class, it cannot be accessed as a field of that class. However, a
shadowed variable can be accessed by casting a reference to an object
of that class to a reference to the appropriate superclass in which
the variable is not shadowed. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class A {
    int x = 4;
}
class B extends A {
    int x = 7;
    B () {
        int i = x;              // i gets the value of B's x
        int h = ((A)this).x;    // h gets the value of A's x
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Alternatively, if a variable is shadowed in a class but not
in its immediate superclass, the methods of the class can access
the shadowed variable using the keyword <tt class=literal>super</tt>.
In the above example, this would look as follows:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
int h = super.x;        // h gets the value of A's x
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If a method is declared with the same name
and parameters as a method in a superclass, the method in the superclass
is considered to be overridden. Note that variable shadowing is
different than method overriding. The most important difference
is that using a reference to an instance of an object's superclass
does not provide access to overridden methods. Overriding is described
in detail in <a href="#JLR2-CH-5-SECT-4.4.2.3">Method name</A>.

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.INIT"></A>A variable declaration
can contain an initializer. However, if a variable is declared to
be <tt class=literal>final</tt>, it must either have an initializer
or be initialized exactly once in a static initializer, instance
initializer, or constructor. If the
variable is of a non-array type, the expression in the initializer
is evaluated and the variable is set to the result of the expression,
as long as the result is assignment-compatible with the variable.
If the variable is of an array type, the initializer must be an
array initializer:


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/jlr0506.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure from the text]" width=424 height=124 border=0>

<p class=para>
Each expression or array initializer in an array initializer is evaluated
and becomes an element of the array produced by the initializer.
The variable is set to the array produced by the initializer, as
long as the assignment is assignment-compatible. Here are some examples
of actual array initializers:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
short a[] = {2,5,8,2,11};    // array of 5 shorts
int s[][] = { {3,45,8},      // array of 4 arrays
              {12,9,33},     // of 3 ints
              {7,22,53},
              {33,1,2} };
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Note that a trailing comma is allowed within an array initializer.
For example, the following is legal:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
int x[] = {2,23,4,};
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Any initializers for class variables (i.e., <tt class=literal>static</tt>
variables) are evaluated when the class is loaded. The initializer for
a class variable cannot refer to any instance variables in the
class. An initializer for a <tt class=literal>static</tt> variable cannot
refer to any <tt class=literal>static</tt> variables that are declared
after its own declaration. The initial value of a class variable can
also be set in a static initializer for the class; static initializers
are described in <a href="#JLR2-CH-5-SECT-4.4.4">Static Initializers</A>.

<p class=para>
Any initializers for instance variables are evaluated when a
constructor for the class is called to create an instance of the
class. Every class has at least one constructor that explicitly or
implicitly calls one of the constructors of its immediate superclass
before it does anything else. When the superclass's constructor
returns, any instance variable initializers (and
instance initializers) are evaluated before the
constructor does anything else. 
The initial value of an instance variable can also be set in
an instance initializer; instance initializers are described in
<a href="#JLR2-CH-5-SECT-4.4.5">Instance Initializers</A>.
Of course, it is also possible to set
the initial values of instance variables explicitly in a
constructor. Constructors are described
in <a href="#JLR2-CH-5-SECT-4.4.3">Constructors</A>.

<p class=para>
If a variable declaration does not contain an initializer, the
variable is set to a default value. The actual value is determined by
the variable's type.  Table 5-1 shows the default values used for the
various types in Java.

<a name="CH05.METH1"></A><a name="CH05.METH2"></A><a name="CH05.METH3"></A>A method is a piece of executable code that can be called as a
subroutine or a function. A method can be passed parameters by its
caller; the method can also return a result to its caller. In Java, a
method can only be declared as a field in a class. The formal
definition of a method declaration is:


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/jlr0507.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure from the text]" width=424 height=181 border=0>

<p class=para>
While the above diagram may seem complicated, a method declaration is
really made up of six distinct things:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Optional modifiers that specify attributes of the method

<p>
<li class=listitem>A type that specifies the type of value returned by the method

<p>
<li class=listitem>An identifier that names the method

<p>
<li class=listitem>A list of formal parameters that specifies the values that are passed
to the method

<p>
<li class=listitem>An optional <tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause that specifies any
exceptions that can be thrown by the method

<p>
<li class=listitem>A block that defines the functionality of the method

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
Here are some examples of method declarations:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public static void main(String[] argv) {
    System.out.println( argv[0] );
}
int readSquare(DataInputStream d) throws IOException {
    int i = d.readInt();
    return i*i;
}
int filledArray(int length, int value) [] {
    int [] array = new int [length];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++ ) {
        array[i] = value;
    }
    return array;
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Unlike C/C++, Java only allows method declarations that fully
specify the type and number of parameters that the method can be
called with.

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.MODMETH"></A>The modifiers <tt class=literal>public</tt>, <tt class=literal>protected</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>private</tt> can be used in the declaration of
a method to specify the accessibility of the method. In this situation,
the modifiers have the following meanings:

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>public</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A method that is declared <tt class=literal>public</tt> is accessible from
any class.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>protected</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A method that is declared <tt class=literal>protected</tt> is accessible
in any class that is part of the same package as the class in which
the method is declared. Such a method is also accessible to any
subclass of the class in which it is declared, regardless of whether
or not the subclass is part of the same package.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>private</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A method that is declared <tt class=literal>private</tt> is only
accessible in the class in which it is declared. Such a method is not
accessible in other classes. In particular, a method that is declared
<tt class=literal>private</tt> is not accessible in subclasses of the
class in which it is declared. A method cannot be declared both
<tt class=literal>private</tt> and <tt class=literal>abstract</tt>.</DL>
<p class=para>
If a method is not declared with any of the access modifiers, it
has the default accessibility. Default access is often called
"friendly" access because it is similar to <tt class=literal>friendly</tt>
access in C++. A method with default access is accessible in any class
that is part of the same package as the class in which the method is
declared. However, a friendly method is not accessible to classes
outside of the package in which it is declared, even if the classes
are subclasses of the class in which it is declared.

<p class=para>
The keywords <tt class=literal>static</tt>, <tt class=literal>final</tt>,
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt>, <tt class=literal>native</tt>, and
<tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> can also be used in the declaration of
a method. These modifiers have the following meanings:

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>static</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A method that is declared with the <tt class=literal>static</tt> modifier
is called a <i class=emphasis>class method</I>.  Class methods are not
associated with an instance of a class. This means that a class method
cannot directly refer to other, non-<tt class=literal>static</tt> methods
or variables in its class, unless the method or variable is accessed
through an explicit object reference. In addition, the keywords
<tt class=literal>this</tt> and <tt class=literal>super</tt> are treated as
undefined variables within <tt class=literal>static</tt> methods. A method
that is declared <tt class=literal>static</tt> is also implicitly
<tt class=literal>final</tt>, or in other words, <tt class=literal>static</tt>
methods cannot be overridden. A method that is declared
<tt class=literal>static</tt> cannot also be declared
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt>.

<p class=para>
Because <tt class=literal>static</tt> methods are not
associated with a class instance, you do not need an instance of
a class to invoke such a method. For example, the <tt class=literal>Math</tt>
class contains a collection of mathematical methods that can be
called using the class name:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
Math.tan(x)
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
A method that is not declared with the <tt class=literal>static</tt>
modifier is called an <i class=emphasis>instance method</I>. Instance
methods are associated with an instance of a class, so an instance
method may contain direct references to any other methods or variables
in its class.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>final</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A method that is declared with the <tt class=literal>final</tt> modifier
cannot be overridden. In other words, if a method in a class is
declared <tt class=literal>final</tt>, no subclass of that class can
declare a method with the same name, number of parameters, and
parameter types as the <tt class=literal>final</tt> method. Although
<tt class=literal>final</tt> methods cannot be overridden, declaring a
method to be <tt class=literal>final</tt> in no way prevents it from being
overloaded.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>abstract</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
If a method is declared with the <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> modifier,
the declaration must end with a semicolon rather than a block. An
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt> method declaration specifies the name,
number and type of parameters, and return type of the method; it does
not specify the implementation of the method. If a class contains an
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt> method, the class must also be declared
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt>.  If a non-<tt class=literal>abstract</tt>
class inherits an <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> method, the class must
override the method and provide an implementation.

<p class=para>
An <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> method cannot also be declared either
<tt class=literal>private</tt> or <tt class=literal>static</tt> because
neither <tt class=literal>private</tt> nor <tt class=literal>static</tt>
methods can be overridden. A <tt class=literal>private</tt> method cannot
be overridden because it is not inherited by its subclasses; a
<tt class=literal>static</tt> method cannot be overridden because it is
implicitly <tt class=literal>final</tt>.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>native</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
If a method is declared with the <tt class=literal>native</tt> modifier,
the declaration must end with a semicolon rather than a block. A
<tt class=literal>native</tt> method is implemented in a platform-specific
way using a language other than Java, such as C++. Because the
implementation of a <tt class=literal>native</tt> method is not done in
Java, Java requires the semicolon in place of an implementation.

<p class=para>
Because the implementation of a <tt class=literal>native</tt> method is
platform-specific, you should avoid using native methods in classes
that are expected to run on different kinds of clients. Native methods
also require an installation process, which is another reason to avoid
them for use on clients.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>synchronized</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
If a method is declared with the <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt>
modifier, a thread must obtain a lock before it can invoke the
method. If the method is not declared <tt class=literal>static</tt>, the
thread must obtain a lock associated with the object used to access
the method. If the method is declared <tt class=literal>static</tt>, the
thread must obtain a lock associated with the class in which the
method is declared.

<p class=para>
A synchronized method is one of two mechanisms for providing
single-threaded access to the contents of a class or object. The other
mechanism is the <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> statement.  Of the
two, a synchronized method is usually the preferred mechanism.  If all
access to instance data that is shared by multiple threads is through
<tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> methods, the integrity of the instance
data is guaranteed, no matter what the callers of the methods do.  On
the other hand, if instance data shared by multiple threads is
directly accessible outside of the class that defines it or its
subclasses, providing single-threaded access to the data requires the
use of <tt class=literal>synchronized</tt> statements.</DL>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="JLR2-CH-5-SECT-4.4.2.2">Method return type</A></h4>

<p class=para>
A method declaration must always specify the type of value returned by
the method. The return value can be of a primitive type or of a
reference type.  If the method does not return a value, it should be
declared with its return type specified as <tt class=literal>void</tt>.
The return type comes before the name of the method in the method declaration.

<p class=para>
The presence of square brackets in a method declaration, after either
the return type or the formal parameters, indicates that the method
returns a reference to the specified type of array.

<p class=para>
For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
int a()[] {...};        // a returns an array of int
int[] b() {...};        // b also returns an array of int
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
It is also possible to declare that a method returns a reference to an
array of arrays, or more generally, arrays nested to any level. Each
pair of square brackets in the declaration corresponds to a dimension
of the array; it makes no difference whether the brackets appear after
the return type or the formal parameters. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
int[][][] d3() {...};    // Each of these returns an array of
int[][] f3()[] {...};    // arrays of arrays of integers
int[] g3()[][] {...};
int h3()[][][] {...};
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If a method is declared
with the <tt class=literal>void</tt> return type, any <tt class=literal>return</tt>
statement that appears within the method must not contain a return
value. Because a method with a <tt class=literal>void</tt> return type
does not return a value, such a method can only be called from an
expression statement that consists of a method call expression.

<p class=para>
On the other hand, if a method is declared with a return type other
than <tt class=literal>void</tt>, it must return through an explicit
<tt class=literal>return</tt> statement that contains a return value that
is assignment-compatible with the return type of the method.

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.METH30"></A>The identifier that follows
the return type is the name of the method. This identifier can be
used anywhere that the method is accessible.

<p class=para>
It is an
error to declare two methods that have the same name, the same number
of parameters, and the same type for each corresponding parameter
in the same class. It is also an error to declare a method with
the same name as a variable declared in the same class or any of
its superclasses.

<p class=para>
A method is said to be <i class=emphasis>overloaded</I>
if there is more than one accessible method in a class with the
same name, but with parameters that differ in number
or type.[5] This situation can arise
if two or more such methods are declared in the same class. It can
also occur when at least one of the methods is defined in a superclass
and the rest are in a subclass.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[5] 
Although
Java supports overloaded methods, it does not allow
programs to define overloaded operators. While it is true that the
<tt class=literal>+</tt> operator is defined in an overloaded way, that
operator is part of the language specification and it is the only
overloaded operator.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Overloaded methods aren't required
to have the same return type. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
int max(int x, int y){return x&gt;y ? x : y;}
double max(double x, double y){return x&gt;y ? x : y;}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
A method that is inherited from a superclass is said to be
<i class=emphasis>overridden</I> if a method in the inheriting class
has the same name, number of parameters, and types of parameters as
the inherited method. If the overridden method returns
<tt class=literal>void</tt>, the overriding method must also return
<tt class=literal>void</tt>. Otherwise, the return type of the overriding
method must be the same as the type of the overridden method.

<p class=para>
An overriding method can be more accessible than the overridden
method, but it cannot be less accessible. In other words, a subclass
cannot hide things that are visible in its superclass, but it can make
visible things that are hidden. An object is considered to be an
instance of its own class, as well as an instance of each of its
superclasses.  As a result, you can use an object reference to call a
method in an object and not worry about whether the object is actually
an instance of a subclass of the type of the reference. If a subclass
were allowed to override methods of its superclass with methods that
were less accessible, you would no longer be able to use a reference
without regard to the actual type of the object being referenced.

<p class=para>
For example, <tt class=literal>Object</tt> is the superclass of
<tt class=literal>String</tt>. This means that a variable declared to
contain a reference to an <tt class=literal>Object</tt> may actually refer
to a <tt class=literal>String</tt>. The <tt class=literal>Object</tt> class
defines a <tt class=literal>public</tt> method called
<tt class=literal>hashCode()</tt>, so a reference to
the <tt class=literal>Object</tt> class can be used to call the
<tt class=literal>hashCode()</tt> method of whatever subclass of
<tt class=literal>Object</tt> it refers to. Allowing a subclass of
<tt class=literal>Object</tt> to declare a <tt class=literal>private
hashcode()</tt> method would be inconsistent with this usage.

If a method in the superclass is declared <tt class=literal>private</tt>,
it is not inherited by the subclass.  This means that a method in the
subclass that has the same name, number of parameters, and types of
parameters does not override the <tt class=literal>private</tt> method in
the superclass. As a result, the method in the subclass can have any
return type and there are no restrictions on its accessibility.

<p class=para>
Non-<tt class=literal>static</tt> methods must be called through an object
reference. If a non-<tt class=literal>static</tt> method is called with no
explicit object reference, it is implicitly called using the object
reference <tt class=literal>this</tt>. At compile-time, the type of the
object reference is used to determine the combinations of method names
and parameters that are accessible to the calling expression (see
<a href="ch04_01.htm">Method Call Expression</A>).
At runtime, however, the
actual type of the object determines which of the methods is
called. If the actual object is an instance of a subclass of the
referenced class and the subclass overrides the method being called,
the overriding method in the subclass is invoked.

<p class=para>
In other words, the actual type of the object is used to determine
which method to call, not the type of the reference to that
object. This means that you cannot simply cast an object reference to
a superclass of the class of the actual object to call to an
overridden method. Instead, you use the keyword
<tt class=literal>super</tt> to access an overridden method in the
superclass. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class A {
    void doit() {
        ...
    }
}
class B extends A {
    void doit() {
        super.doit();      // calls overridden A.doit()
    }
    public static void main(String argv[]) {
        B b = new B();
        ((A)b).doit();     // calls B.doit()
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>doit()</tt> method in class <tt class=literal>B</tt>
calls the overridden <tt class=literal>doit()</tt> method in class
<tt class=literal>A</tt> using the <tt class=literal>super</tt>
construct. But, in <tt class=literal>main()</tt>, the
<tt class=literal>doit()</tt> method in class <tt class=literal>B</tt> is
invoked because casting a reference does not provide access to
overridden methods.

Within the block that contains the implementation of the method, the
method's formal parameters are treated as local variables; the name of
each formal parameter is available as an identifier in the method's
implementation.  Formal parameters differ from local variables only in
that their declaration and value come from outside the method's block.

<p class=para>
If a formal parameter is declared <tt class=literal>final</tt>, 
any assignment to that parameter generates an error. 
The syntax for declaring <tt class=literal>final</tt> 
parameters is not supported prior to Java 1.1.

<p class=para>
If a method has no formal parameters, the parentheses must
still appear in the method declaration.

<p class=para>
Here's an example of a method declaration with formal parameters:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
abstract int foo(DataInputStream d, Double[] values, int weights[]) ;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The presence of square brackets
in a formal parameter declaration, either as part of a reference
type or after the name of a formal parameter, indicates that the
formal parameter is an array type. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
foo(int a[],    // a is an array of int
    int[] b)    // b is also an array of int
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
It is also possible to declare that a formal parameter is an array of
arrays, or more generally, arrays nested to any level. Each pair of
square brackets in the declaration corresponds to a dimension of the
array; it makes no difference whether the brackets appear with the
type or after the name of the formal parameter. For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
int[][][] d3        // Each of these is an array of
int[][] f3[]        // arrays of arrays of integers
int[] g3[][]
int h3[][][]
</PRE>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.THROWS1"></A><a name="CH05.THROWS2"></A>If a method is expected to throw any exceptions, the method
declaration must declare that fact in a <tt class=literal>throws</tt>
clause. Java requires that most types of exceptions either be caught
or declared, so bugs caused by programmers forgetting to handle
particular types of exceptions are uncommon in Java programs.

<p class=para>
If a method implementation contains a <tt class=literal>throw</tt>
statement, or if the method calls another method declared with a
<tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause, there is the possibility that an
exception will be thrown from within the method. If the exception is
not caught, it will be thrown out of the method to its caller. Any
exception that can be thrown out of a method in this way must be
listed in a <tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause in the method
declaration, unless the exception is an instance of
<tt class=literal>Error</tt>, <tt class=literal>RuntimeException</tt>, or a
subclass of one of those classes. Subclasses of the
<tt class=literal>Error</tt> class correspond to situations that are not
easily predicted, such as the system running out of memory. Subclasses
of <tt class=literal>RuntimeException</tt> correspond to many common
runtime problems, such as illegal casts and array index problems. The
classes listed in a <tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause must be
<tt class=literal>Throwable</tt> or any of its subclasses; the
<tt class=literal>Throwable</tt> class is the superclass of all objects
that can be thrown in Java.

<p class=para>
Consider the following example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
import java.io.IOException;
class throwsExample {
    char[] a;
    int position;
    ...
    // Method explicitly throws an exception
    int read() throws IOException {
        if (position &gt;= a.length)
            throw new IOException();
        return a[position++];
    }
    // Method implicitly throws an exception
    String readUpTo(char terminator) throws IOException {

        while (true) {
            int c = read(); // Can throw IOException
            if (c == -1 || c == terminator) {
                return s.toString();
            }
            s.append((char)c);
        }
        return s.toString():
    }
    // Method catches an exception internally
    int getLength() {
        String s;
        try {
            s = readUpTo(':');
        } catch (IOException e) {
            return 0;
        }
        return s.length();
    }
    // Method can throw a RuntimeException
    int getAvgLength() {
        int count = 0;
        int total = 0;
        int len;
        while (true){
            len = getLength();
            if (len == 0)
                break;
            count++;
            total += len;
        }
        return total/count; // Can throw ArithmeticException
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The method <tt class=literal>read()</tt> can throw an
<tt class=literal>IOException</tt>, so it declares that fact in its
<tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause.  Without that
<tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause, the compiler would complain that the
method must either declare <tt class=literal>IOException</tt> in its
<tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause or catch it. Although the
<tt class=literal>readUpTo()</tt> method does not explicitly throw any
exceptions, it calls the <tt class=literal>read()</tt> method that does
throw an <tt class=literal>IOException</tt>, so it declares that fact in
its <tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause. Whether explicitly or implicitly
thrown, the requirement to catch or declare an exception is the
same. The <tt class=literal>getLength()</tt> method catches the
<tt class=literal>IOException</tt> thrown by
<tt class=literal>readUpTo()</tt>, so it does not have to declare the
exception. The final method, <tt class=literal>getAvgLength()</tt>, can
throw an <tt class=literal>ArithmeticException</tt> if
<tt class=literal>count</tt> is zero. Because
<tt class=literal>ArithmeticException</tt> is a subclass of
<tt class=literal>RuntimeException</tt>, the fact that it can be thrown
out of <tt class=literal>getAvgLength()</tt> does not need to be declared.

<p class=para>
If a method overrides another method, the overriding method cannot
throw anything that the overridden method does not throw.
Specifically, if the declaration of a method contains a
<tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause, any method that overrides that
method cannot include any classes in its <tt class=literal>throws</tt>
clause that are not declared in the overridden method. This
restriction avoids surprises. When a method is called, the Java
compiler requires that all of the objects listed the method's
<tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause are either caught by the calling
method or declared in the calling method's <tt class=literal>throws</tt>
clause. The requirement that an overriding method cannot include any
class in its <tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause that is not in the
overridden method's <tt class=literal>throws</tt> clause ensures that the
guarantee made by the compiler is respected by the runtime
environment.

<p class=para>
The modifiers <tt class=literal>public</tt>, <tt class=literal>protected</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>private</tt> can be used in the declaration of
a constructor to specify the accessibility of the constructor. In
this situation, the modifiers have the following meanings:

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>public</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A constructor that is declared <tt class=literal>public</tt> is accessible
from any class.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>protected</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A constructor that is declared <tt class=literal>protected</tt> is
accessible in any class that is part of the same package as the class
in which the constructor is declared. Such a constructor is also
accessible to any subclass of the class in which it is declared,
regardless of whether or not the subclass is part of the same package.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>private</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A constructor that is declared <tt class=literal>private</tt>
is accessible in the class in which it is declared. Such a constructor
is not accessible in other classes. In particular, a constructor
that is declared <tt class=literal>private</tt> is not accessible in
subclasses of the class in which it is declared.

<p class=para>
If a class is declared with at least one constructor, to prevent Java
from providing a default <tt class=literal>public</tt> constructor, and
all of the constructors are declared <tt class=literal>private</tt>, no
other class can create an instance of the class. It makes sense to
prevent the instantiation of a class if the class exists only to
provide a collection of <tt class=literal>static</tt> methods. An example
of this type of class is <tt class=literal>java.lang.Math</tt>.

<p class=para>
<tt class=literal>private</tt> constructors
can be used by <tt class=literal>static</tt> methods in the same class.</DL>
<p class=para>
If a constructor is not declared with any of the access modifiers, the
constructor has the default accessibility. Default access is often
called "friendly" access because it is similar to
<tt class=literal>friendly</tt> access in C++. A constructor with default
access is accessible in any class that is part of the same package as
the class in which the constructor is declared. However, a friendly
constructor is not accessible in subclasses of the class in which it
is declared.

<p class=para>
The block at the end of a constructor declaration contains the
implementation of the constructor. The block is called the constructor
body.  The first statement in a constructor body is special; it is
the only place that Java allows an explicit call to a constructor
outside of an allocation expression. An explicit call to a constructor
has a special form:


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/jlr0510.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure from the text]" width=424 height=241 border=0>

<p class=para>
In an explicit constructor call, the keyword <tt class=literal>this</tt>
can be used to specify a call to a constructor in the same class.  The
keyword <tt class=literal>super</tt> can be used to specify a call to a
constructor in the immediate superclass.

<p class=para>
For example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class Square extends RegularPolygon {
    // Construct a square without specifying the length of the sides
    Square() {
        this(5);
    }
    // Construct a square with sides of a specified length
    Square(int len) {
        super(4,len);
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The first constructor simply calls the second constructor with the
argument 5. The second constructor calls a constructor in the
immediate superclass to create a four-sided regular polygon with sides
of the given length.

<p class=para>
Except for the constructors in the class <tt class=literal>Object</tt>, a
constructor always begins by calling another constructor in the same
class or in its immediate superclass. If the first statement in a
constructor is not an explicit call to another constructor using
<tt class=literal>this</tt> or <tt class=literal>super</tt> and the class is
not <tt class=literal>Object</tt>, the compiler inserts a call to
<tt class=literal>super()</tt> before the first statement in the
constructor. 

<p class=para>
In other words, if a constructor does not begin with an
explicit call to another constructor, it begins with an implicit call
to the constructor of its immediate superclass that takes no argument.
The result is
constructor chaining: a constructor for each superclass of a class is
called before the constructor of the class executes any of its own
code.  After all of the calls to the superclasses' constructors
(explicit or implicit) have returned, any instance variables that have
initializers are initialized, and finally the constructor executes its
own code.

<p class=para>
Constructor chaining places a restriction on the arguments that can be
passed to a constructor in an explicit constructor call. The
expressions provided as arguments must not refer to any instance
variables of the object being created because these instance variables
are not initialized until the superclass's constructor returns.

<p class=para>
If a class declaration does not contain any constructor declarations,
Java supplies a default constructor for the class. The default
constructor is <tt class=literal>public</tt>, it takes no arguments, and
it simply calls the constructor of its class's superclass that takes no
arguments. The default constructor is approximately equivalent to:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public MyClass() {
    super();
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Because Java creates a default constructor only for a class that does
not have any explicitly declared constructors, it is possible for the
superclass of that class not to have a constructor that takes no
arguments. If a class declaration does not contain a constructor
declaration and its immediate superclass does not have a constructor
that takes no arguments, the compiler issues an error message because
the default constructor references a non-existent constructor in the
superclass. The default constructor for the class
<tt class=literal>Object</tt> does not contain a call to another
constructor because class <tt class=literal>Object</tt> has no superclass.

<p class=para>
A subclass does not inherit constructors from its superclass, as it
does normal methods. This is one important difference between regular
methods and constructors: constructors are not inherited. However, a
subclass can access a constructor in its superclass, as long as the
constructor is accessible, based on any access modifiers used in its
declaration.

<p class=para>
This example illustrates the difference between inheritance and accessibility:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public class A {
    public A (int q) {
    }
}
public class B extends A {
    public B () {
        super(5);
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Although class <tt class=literal>B</tt> is a subclass of class
<tt class=literal>A</tt>, <tt class=literal>B</tt> does not inherit the public
constructor in <tt class=literal>A</tt> that takes a single argument.
This means that if you try to create a new instance of
<tt class=literal>B</tt> using an allocation expression with a single
argument, you'll get an error message from the compiler. Here's an
erroneous call:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
B b1 = new B(9);
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
However, as shown in the example, the constructor in
<tt class=literal>B</tt> can access the constructor in
<tt class=literal>A</tt> using the keyword <tt class=literal>super</tt>.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JLR2-CH-5-SECT-4.4.2.7">The finalize method</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A class declaration can include a special method that is called before
an instance of the class is destroyed by the garbage collector. This
method is called a <i class=emphasis>finalizer</I> ; it has the name
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt>.  The <tt class=literal>finalize()</tt>
method for a class must be declared with no parameters, a
<tt class=literal>void</tt> return type, and no modifiers:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
void finalize() {...}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If a class has a <tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method, it is normally
called by the garbage collector before an object of that class type is
destroyed. A program can also explicitly call an object's
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method, but in this case, the garbage
collector does not call the method during the object destruction
process. If the garbage collector does call an object's
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method, the garbage collector does not
immediately destroy the object because the
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method might do something that results
in a reference to the object. Thus the garbage collector waits to
destroy the object until it can again prove it is safe to do so. The
next time the garbage collector decides it is safe to destroy the
object, it does so without calling the finalizer again. In any case, a
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method is never called more than once
by the garbage collector for a particular object.

<p class=para>
A superclass of the class may also define a
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method, but Java does not provide a
mechanism that automatically calls the superclass's
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method. If a class contains a
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method, it is a good idea for that
method to call <tt class=literal>super.finalize()</tt> as the very last
thing that it does. This technique ensures that the
<tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method of the superclass gets
called. The technique even works if the superclass does not explicitly
define a <tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method, since every class
inherits a default <tt class=literal>finalize()</tt> method from the
<tt class=literal>Object</tt> class. This default
<tt class=literal>finalize</tt> method does not do anything.

<p class=para>
A <i class=emphasis>static initializer</I> 
is a piece of code that is executed when a class
is loaded. A static initializer is simply a block of code in a class
declaration that is preceded by the keyword <tt class=literal>static</tt>:


<p>

<p class=para>
A class is loaded when its definition is needed by another class. You
can specifically request that a class be loaded by calling the
<tt class=literal>forName()</tt> method of the <tt class=literal>Class</tt>
class on the class you want to load. Alternatively, you can use the
<tt class=literal>loadClass()</tt> method of a
<tt class=literal>ClassLoader</tt> object to load a class directly.

<p class=para>
When a class is loaded, a <tt class=literal>Class</tt> object is created
to represent it and storage for the class's <tt class=literal>static</tt>
variables is allocated.  When a class is initialized, its static
initializers and <tt class=literal>static</tt> variable initializers are
evaluated in the order in which they appear in the class
declaration. For example, here is a class that contains both static
initializers and <tt class=literal>static</tt> variable initializers:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class foo {
    static int i = 4;
    static {
        i += 2;
        j = 5 * i;
    }
    static int j = 7;
    static double d;
    static frame f = new Frame();
    static { d = Math.tan(Math.PI/j); }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
When the <tt class=literal>foo</tt> class is loaded, here is what
happens. First, the variable <tt class=literal>i</tt> is set to 4. Then
the first static initializer is executed. It increments
<tt class=literal>i</tt> by 2, which makes it 6, and sets
<tt class=literal>j</tt> to <tt class=literal>5*i</tt>, which is 30. Next, the
variable <tt class=literal>j</tt> is set to 7 by its initializer; this
overwrites the value that was set in the static initializer. The
variable <tt class=literal>f</tt> is then set to the new
<tt class=literal>Frame</tt> object created by its initializer. Finally,
the second static initializer is executed.  It sets the variable
<tt class=literal>d</tt> to <img src='figs/eq5_1.gif' border=0>, which is <img src='figs/eq5_2.gif' border=0>.

<p class=para>
Notice that the first static initializer uses the variable
<tt class=literal>j</tt>, even though the variable is not declared until
after the static initializer. A static initializer can refer to a
<tt class=literal>static</tt> variable that is declared after the static
initializer. However, the same is not true for
<tt class=literal>static</tt> variable initializers. A
<tt class=literal>static</tt> variable initializer cannot refer to any
variables that are declared after its own declaration, or the compiler
generates an error message. The following class declaration is
erroneous:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
class foo {
    static int x = y*3;    // error because y defined after x
    static int y;
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If an exception is thrown out of a static initializer, the method that
caused the class to be defined throws an
<tt class=literal>ExceptionInInitializerError</tt>. 
This <tt class=literal>ExceptionInInitializerError</tt> 
contains a reference to the original exception that can be fetched by
calling its <tt class=literal>getException()</tt> method.

<p class=para>
An <i class=emphasis>instance initializer</I> is a piece of code that
is executed when an instance of a class is created. Specifically, 
it is executed after the object's immediate superclass constructor 
returns, but before the constructor of the class itself runs.
An instance initializer is simply a block of code in a class that
is not in any method. Here is the formal syntax:


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/jlr0512.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure from the text]" width=424 height=224 border=0>

<p class=para>
Every class has at least one constructor that explicitly or
implicitly calls one of the constructors of its immediate superclass
before it does anything else. When the superclass's constructor
returns, any instance initializers and instance variable
initializers are evaluated before the constructor does anything else.
The instance initializers and instance variable initializers are
evaluated in the order in which they appear in the class
declaration. If an instance
initializer throws an exception, the exception appears to have
come from the constructor that called the superclass's constructor.

<a name="CH05.NESTED1"></A><a name="CH05.NESTED2"></A><a name="CH05.NESTED3"></A><a name="CH05.NESTED4"></A>Nested top-level classes and member classes are classes that
are declared inside of another class. Just as with a top-level
class declaration, the declaration of a nested top-level class or member
class creates a reference type in Java. Here's the formal definition of
a nested top-level or member class declaration:


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/jlr0513.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure from the text]" width=450 height=267 border=0>

<p class=para>
A class declared inside of another class has access to all of the
variables, methods, and other inner classes of the enclosing class. 
If a nested top-level or member class is not <tt class=literal>private</tt>, 
it can also be accessed outside of its enclosing class by
qualifying its name with the name of its enclosing class, as follows:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<i class=emphasis>EnclosingClass</I>.<i class=emphasis>InnerClass</I>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The syntax for declaring nested top-level classes and member classes
is not supported prior to Java 1.1.

<p class=para>
The keywords <tt class=literal>public</tt>, <tt class=literal>protected</tt>, 
and <tt class=literal>private</tt> can be used in the declaration of a
nested top-level or member class to specify the accessibility of the 
inner class. In this situation, the modifiers have the following meanings:

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>public</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A nested top-level or member class that is declared <tt class=literal>public</tt> 
is accessible from any class that can access the enclosing class.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>protected</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A nested top-level or member class that is declared
<tt class=literal>protected</tt> is accessible from any class that is part
of the same package as the enclosing class. Such an inner class is
also accessible to any subclass of the enclosing class, regardless of
whether or not the subclass is part of the same package.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>private</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
A nested top-level or member class that is declared
<tt class=literal>private</tt> is only accessible from its enclosing class
and other classes declared within the enclosing class.  In particular,
an inner class that is declared <tt class=literal>private</tt> is not
accessible in subclasses of its enclosing class.</DL>
<p class=para>
If a nested top-level or member class is not declared with any of the
access modifiers, the class has the default accessability. Default
access is often called "friendly" access because it is similar to
<tt class=literal>friendly</tt> access in C++. An inner class with default
access is accessible in any class that is part of the same package 
as the enclosing class. However, a friendly
inner class is not accessible to classes outside of the package of the
enclosing class, even if the desired classes are subclasses of the 
enclosing class.

<p class=para>
The keywords <tt class=literal>abstract</tt>, <tt class=literal>final</tt>,
and <tt class=literal>static</tt> can also be used in the 
declaration of a nested top-level or member class.  These modifiers
have the following meanings:

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>abstract</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
If a nested top-level or member class is declared
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt>, no instances of the class may be
created. An inner class declared <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> may
contain <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> methods; classes not declared
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt> may not contain
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt> methods and must override any
<tt class=literal>abstract</tt> methods they inherit with methods that are
not <tt class=literal>abstract</tt>. Furthermore, classes that implement
an interface and are not declared <tt class=literal>abstract</tt> must
contain or inherit methods that are not <tt class=literal>abstract</tt>,
that have the same name, have the same number of parameters,
and have corresponding
parameter types as the methods declared in the interfaces that the
class implements.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>final</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
If a nested top-level or member class is declared
<tt class=literal>final</tt>, it cannot be subclassed. In other words, it
connot appear in the <tt class=literal>extends</tt> clause of another
class.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>static</tt><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
An inner class that is declared with the <tt class=literal>static</tt> modifier
is called a nested top-level class. A class can only be declared with
the <tt class=literal>static</tt> modifier if its enclosing class is a
top-level class (i.e., it is not declared within another class). The
code within a nested top-level class cannot directly access
non-<tt class=literal>static</tt> variables and methods of its enclosing
class.

<p class=para>
An inner class that is not declared with the <tt class=literal>static</tt>
modifier is called a member class. The code within a member class can 
access all of the variables and methods of its
enclosing class, including <tt class=literal>private</tt> variables and
methods.</DL>
