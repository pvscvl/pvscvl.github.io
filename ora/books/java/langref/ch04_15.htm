<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JLR2-CH-4-SECT-15">4.15 Data Type of an Expression</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH04.DTE1"></A><a name="CH04.DTE2"></A>If an expression
produces a value, that value is of some particular data type.
In some cases, it is possible to determine the exact type that is
produced by an expression, based on the types of the literals, variables,
and methods that an expression references. For
those expressions that produce object references, it is typically
only possible to determine the type of the referenced object when
the expression is evaluated at runtime.

<p class=para>
The types of
many expressions are ambiguous because of the way Java data types
are defined. There is no ambiguity for variables, array elements,
and method return values of primitive types, however. These expressions
always produce the exact types specified in their declarations.

<p class=para>
There can be ambiguity when a variable, array element,
or method return value is declared to have a class or interface
reference type. The ambiguity exists because a class reference may
actually refer to an object of the intended class or a subclass
of that class. For example, consider a variable that is declared
to contain a reference to a <tt class=literal>Number</tt> object:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
double square(Number n){
    return n.doubleValue()*n.doubleValue();
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
When the Java compiler sees the variable <tt class=literal>n</tt> used in
an expression, it knows that the object that is referenced could
be an <tt class=literal>Integer</tt>, <tt class=literal>Long</tt>, <tt class=literal>Float</tt>,
or <tt class=literal>Double</tt> object because the <tt class=literal>java.lang</tt>
package defines those subclasses of <tt class=literal>Number</tt>. It
is also possible, however, that the variable refers to some other
subclass of <tt class=literal>Number</tt> defined elsewhere. All that
the compiler can be certain of is that at runtime <tt class=literal>n</tt>
will refer to an object of a subclass of <tt class=literal>Number</tt>.
The variable <tt class=literal>n</tt> cannot refer to a <tt class=literal>Number</tt>
object because <tt class=literal>Number</tt> is an <tt class=literal>abstract</tt>
class, so there are no <tt class=literal>Number</tt> objects.

<p class=para>
The
one exception to the ambiguity of class-type object references occurs
when the class used to declare a variable, array element, or method
return type is a <tt class=literal>final</tt> class. If a class is declared
to be <tt class=literal>final</tt>,
it cannot be subclassed, so there is no ambiguity.

<p class=para>
Ambiguity also exists if the type of a reference is an interface type, since
the reference can refer to an object of any class that implements
the interface. The actual class is not usually known until runtime.

<p class=para>
The fact that the type of value produced by an object reference
expression cannot be determined until it is evaluated at runtime
can affect the evaluation of other expressions in the following
ways:
<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>If a method is called through an object reference
expression, the actual method to be called may depend on the type
of the object. The selection of the appropriate method in the object
is made at compile-time. For example, <tt class=literal>f.read()</tt>
causes the selection of a method named <tt class=literal>read()</tt>
that takes no arguments.

<p class=para>
However, if the compiler cannot
determine the actual class of the object, the actual method to be
called is determined at runtime, when the class is known. The compiler
generates code to handle a runtime selection process called dynamic
method lookup. The process begins by searching the actual class
for an appropriate method. If there is no such method, the superclass
of the class is searched, followed by its superclass and on up the
inheritance hierarchy, until an appropriate method is found. This
process ensures that the appropriate method gets called, even if
the actual class of the object is a subclass of the type used for
the object reference.

<p class=para>
Even if the compiler cannot determine
the actual class of the object, there is one case in which it does
not need to generate code to handle dynamic method lookup. When
the compiler selects the appropriate method in the object, if it
finds that the method is declared <tt class=literal>final</tt>, 
it can be sure that it
is the method to be called.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The success of a cast operation
may need to be determined at runtime. When a class-type object reference
is cast to another class, the operation can only succeed if the
actual class of the object is the same class or a subclass of the
class being cast to. If the compiler cannot determine the actual
class of the object, it generates runtime code that can verify that
the cast is permitted. If the actual class of the object at runtime
makes the cast illegal, a <tt class=literal>ClassCastException</tt>
is thrown.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The value produced by the <tt class=literal>instanceof</tt>
operator may need to be determined at runtime. If the compiler cannot
determine the type of the left operand in an <tt class=literal>instanceof</tt>
expression, it generates runtime code to decide whether the expression
produces <tt class=literal>true</tt> or <tt class=literal>false</tt>.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The legality of an assignment to an array element may need
to be determined at runtime. If a variable contains a reference
to an array and the type of elements in the array is specified with
a class or an interface name, it may not be possible to determine
the actual type of the array elements until runtime. Consider the
following example:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
void foo (InputStream a[]) {
    a[0] = new FileInputStream("/dev/null");
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Any array with elements that contain references to objects
of class <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt> or any of its subclasses
can be passed to the method <tt class=literal>foo()</tt> shown above.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
FileInputStream f[] = new FileInputStream[3];
foo(f);
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Since <tt class=literal>FileInputStream</tt> is a subclass of
<tt class=literal>InputStream</tt>, the call to <tt class=literal>foo()</tt>
does not cause any type-related problems at runtime. However, the
following call to <tt class=literal>foo()</tt> does cause problems:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
DataInputStream f[] = new DataInputStream[3];
foo(f);
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This call causes an <tt class=literal>ArrayStoreException</tt>
to be thrown at runtime. Although <tt class=literal>DataInputStream</tt>
is a subclass of <tt class=literal>InputStream</tt>, it is not a superclass
of <tt class=literal>FileInputStream</tt>, so the assignment is not
legal.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The type of object thrown by a <tt class=literal>throw</tt>
statement may need to be determined at runtime. If the object thrown
by a <tt class=literal>throw</tt> statement is obtained through a reference
that comes from a variable, an array element, or a method return
value, the compiler generates runtime code that determines the type
of the object that is thrown. In addition, this runtime code determines
whether or not the object is caught.
