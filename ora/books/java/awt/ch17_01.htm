<p class=para>
Java 1.1 introduces the ability to print, a capability that was sadly missing 
in Java 1.0, even though the <tt class=literal>Component</tt> 
class had <tt class=literal>print()</tt> and <tt class=literal>printAll()</tt> 
methods. However, it is possible to print arbitrary content, including multipage documents. The printing facility in Java 1.1 is designed primarily to let a program 
print its display area or any of the components within its display.<a name="CH17.PRINT"></A>

<p class=para>
Printing is implemented with the help of one public interface, <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt>, 
and one public class, <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt>, 
of AWT. The real work is hidden behind classes provided with the toolkit 
for your platform. On Windows NT/95 platforms, these classes are <tt class=literal>sun.awt.windows.WPrintGraphics</tt> 
and <tt class=literal>sun.awt.windows.WPrintJob</tt>. 
Other platforms have similarly named classes. 

<p class=para>
Printing from an applet has security implications and is restricted by 
the <tt class=literal>SecurityManager</tt>. It is 
reasonable to suppose that a browser will make it possible to print a page 
containing an applet; in fact, Netscape has done so ever since Navigator 3.0. However, 
this ability might not take advantage of Java's printing facility. 
It isn't reasonable to suppose that an applet will be able to initiate 
a print job on its own. You might allow a signed applet coming from a trusted 
source to do so, but you wouldn't want to give any random applet 
access to your printer. (If you don't understand why, imagine the 
potential for abuse.) 

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="JAWT-CH-17-SECT-1">17.1 PrintGraphics Interface</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH17.PRINT2"></A><a name="CH17.PRINT3"></A>Printing is similar to drawing an object on the screen. Just as you draw 
onto a graphics context to display something on the screen, you draw onto 
a "printing context" to create an image for printing. Furthermore, 
the printing context and graphics context are very closely related. The 
graphics context is an instance of the class <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt>. 
The printing context is also an instance of <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt>, 
with the additional requirement that it implement the <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt> 
interface. Therefore, any methods that you use to draw graphics can also 
be used for printing. Furthermore, the <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> 
method (which a component uses to draw itself on the screen) is also called 
when a component must draw itself for printing. 

<p class=para>
In short, to print, you get a special <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> 
object that implements the <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt> 
interface by calling the <tt class=literal>getGraphics()</tt> 
method of <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt> (discussed 
later in this chapter) through <tt class=literal>Toolkit</tt>. You 
then call a component's <tt class=literal>print()</tt> 
or <tt class=literal>printAll()</tt> method or a container's 
<tt class=literal>printComponents()</tt> method, with 
this object as the argument. These methods arrange for a call to <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>, 
which can draw on the printing context to its heart's content. In 
the simple case where you're just rendering the component on paper, 
you shouldn't have to change <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> 
at all. Of course, if you are doing something more complex (that is, printing 
something that doesn't look exactly like your component), you'll 
have to modify <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> to determine 
whether it's painting on screen or on paper, and act accordingly. 
The code would look something like this: 

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    if (g instanceof PrintGraphics) {
        // Printing
    }else {
        // Painting
    }
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If the graphics object you receive is an instance of <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt>, 
you know that <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> has been 
called for a print request and can do anything specific to printing. As 
I said earlier, you can use all the methods of <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> 
to draw on <tt class=literal>g</tt>. If you're 
printing, though, you might do anything from making sure that you print 
in black and white to drawing something completely different. (This might 
be the trick you use to print the contents of a component rather than the 
component itself. However, as of Java 1.1, it's impossible to prevent 
the component from drawing itself. Remember that your <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> 
method was never responsible for drawing the component; it only drew additions 
to the basic component. For the time being, it's the same with printing.) 

<p class=para>
When you call <tt class=literal>printComponents()</tt> 
on a <tt class=literal>Container</tt>, all the components 
within the container will be printed. Early beta versions of 1.1 only painted 
the outline of components within the container. The component should print as it appears on the screen. 

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="JAWT-CH-17-SECT-1.1">Methods</A></h3>

<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>public abstract PrintJob getPrintJob () <img src="gifs/bstar.gif" alt="(New)" border=0> </I><br>
<dd>

<p class=para>
The <tt class=literal>getPrintJob()</tt> method returns 
the <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt> instance that 
created this <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt> 
instance. 

<p class=para>
This seems like circular logic: you need a <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt> 
to create a <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt> object, 
but you can get a <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt> 
only from a <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt> object. 
To break the circle, you can get an initial <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt> 
by calling the <tt class=literal>getPrintJob()</tt> 
method of <tt class=literal>Toolkit</tt>. <tt class=literal>getPrintJob()</tt> 
looks like it will be useful primarily within <tt class=literal>paint()</tt>, 
where you don't have access to the original <tt class=literal>PrintJob</tt> 
object and need to get it from the graphics context. </DL>
<p class=para>
System-provided <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt> 
objects inherit their other methods from the <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> 
class, which is discussed in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>Simple Graphics</i></A>.[1] 
The one method that's worth noting here is <tt class=literal>dispose()</tt>. 
In a regular <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt> object, 
calling <tt class=literal>dispose()</tt> frees any 
system resources the object requires. For a <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt> 
object, <tt class=literal>dispose()</tt> sends the 
current object to the printer prior to deallocating its resources. Calling 
<tt class=literal>dispose()</tt> is therefore equivalent 
to sending a form feed to eject the current page. 

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
 
Anything can implement the <tt class=literal>PrintGraphics</tt> 
interface, not just subclasses of <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt>. 
However, in order for <tt class=literal>paint()</tt> 
and <tt class=literal>print()</tt> to work, it must 
be a subclass of <tt class=literal>Graphics</tt>.
