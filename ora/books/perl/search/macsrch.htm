<h1>About Searching on a Macintosh</h1>

<p>Due to the lack of a command line on the Macintosh, using Java
applications is a little bit complicated.  If you follow these steps,
running the search server should not be too painful.

<p><b>NOTE</b>: This search engine requires MRJ (MacOS Runtime for
Java) 2.0.  If you have upgraded to MRJ 2.1 or got it with a recent
copy of the MacOS, the search engine will not work.  To check your
version of MRJ, go into your <b>System Folder</b>, then to
<b>Extensions</b>, and then to <b>MRJ Libraries</b>.  Select
<b>MRJLib</b> and select <b>File</b><img src="../chars/rarr.gif" alt="-&gt;"><b>Get Info</b> (command-i).  It should say, "MacOS
Runtime for Java 2.0".

<ol>

<li>In the <b>mac</b> folder on the CD is a BinHex file called
<b>macsearch.hqx</b>.  De-BinHex it; you may be able to double-click
on it to do this, or you may need to open it with an expander like
UnStuffIt.  That will create an Applescript application called
<b>Start Search Service</b>.  (If you had to do this manually, the
next step will fail, but do it anyway.)

<li>Run <b>Start Search Service</b>.  It should copy some files into
your <b>Preferences</b> folder and create an alias on your desktop
called <b>NRSearch</b>.  If this step fails part way through, go to <a href="#manual">Installing the Server Manually</a> below.

<li>Run <b>NRSearch</b>.  You will see a console window while the
search server is running.  Quitting the application will shut down the
search server.

</ol>

<p>You can safely move the <b>NRSearch</b> alias anywhere you like
without affecting the performance of the search engine.  You should
not move the <b>NRPrefs</b> folder from your <b>Preferences</b>
folder, or change any of the files inside that folder.

<h3><a name="manual">Installing the Server Manually</a></h3>

<p>The <b>Start Search Service</b> script performs a number of steps.
If it fails, you need to determine where it failed and complete the
process.

<ol>

<li><p>The script should copy the <b>NRPrefs</b> folder from the
<b>mac</b> folder on the CD into your <b>Preferences</b> folder in
your <b>System Folder</b>.  If that didn't happen, copy it now.

<li><p>Next, you'll need to de-BinHex <b>NRSearch.hqx</b> in that
folder; this is probably where the script failed.

<li><p>For convenience, you should make an alias to the resulting
<b>NRSearch</b> and copy it somewhere handy, like the Desktop.

</ol>
