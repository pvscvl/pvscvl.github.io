>The forgery in the attendant sidebar appeared on Usenet on April Fool's Day, 1990.
It is presented here without comment, merely to show how disgusting the
metaphors of a typical programming language really are. So much for anything 
resembling literary value. Larry is particularly relieved that &quot;Black Perl&quot;, 
originally written for Perl 3, no longer parses under Perl 5.</P

Perhaps it's because I recently posted to both comp.lang.perl and to rec.arts.poems, but people <br>seem to be writing poems in Perl, and they're asking me where they should post them. Here is a sampling:<br>From a graduate student (in finals week), the following haiku:</P

Or, alternately, we should <br>create rec.arts.poems.perl for items such as those above which merely parse, and don't do anything useful.  <br>(There is precedent in rec.arts.poems, after all.)  Then also create comp.lang.perl.poems for poems that <br>actually do something, such as this haiku of my own:</P

><p class="para">Larry's, er, corpus has fortunately been overshadowed by that of the
reigning Perl Poet, Sharon Hopkins.  She has written quite a few Perl
poems, as well as a paper on Perl poetry that she presented at the Usenix
Winter 1992 Technical Conference, entitled &quot;Camels and Needles: Computer
Poetry Meets the Perl Programming Language&quot;.  (The paper is available as
<em class="emphasis">misc/poetry.ps</EM

prolific Perl poet, 
Sharon is also the most widely published, having had
the following poem published in both the <em class="emphasis">Economist</EM

listen (please, please);

    open yourself, wide;
	join (you, me),
    connect (us,together),

tell me.

do something if distressed;

	@dawn, dance;
	@evening, sing;
	read (books,$poems,stories) until peaceful;
	study if able;

	write me if-you-please;

sort your feelings, reset goals, seek (friends, family, anyone);

	    do*not*die (like this)
	    if sin abounds;

keys (hidden), open (locks, doors), tell secrets;
    do not, I-beg-you, close them, yet.

				accept (yourself, changes),
				bind (grief, despair);

    require truth, goodness if-you-will, each moment;

select (always), length(of-days)
