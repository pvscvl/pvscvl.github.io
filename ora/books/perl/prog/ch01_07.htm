foremost, they're used in conditionals to determine whether a string
matches a particular pattern.  So when you see something that looks like

with something else.  So when you see something that looks like
<code class="literal">s/foo/bar/</CODE

possible.  We call that the <em class="emphasis">substitution</EM

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1464"></A

where it isn't.  So the <a class="xref" href="ch03_155.htm#PERL2-CMD-SPLIT" title="split"><b class="xref.cmd">split</B
></A
> operator uses a regular expression
to specify where the data isn't.  That is, the regular expression
defines the <em class="emphasis">delimiters</EM

example has a couple of trivial examples of this.  Lines 5 and 12 each
split strings on the space character in order to return a list of words.
But you can split on any delimiter you can specify with a regular
expression.</P

exotic things like ignore case when matching alphabetic characters, but
these are the sorts of gory details that we'll cover in <a class="xref" href="ch02_01.htm" title="The Gory Details">Chapter 2</A

><p class="para">The simplest use of regular expressions is to match a literal
expression.  In the case of the splits we just mentioned, we matched on
a single space.  But if you match on several characters in a row, they
all have to match sequentially.  That is, the pattern looks for a
substring, much as you'd expect.  Let's say we want to show all the
lines of an HTML file that are links to other HTML files (as opposed to
FTP links).  Let's imagine we're working with HTML for the first time,
and we're being a little naive yet.  We know that these links will
always have &quot;http:&quot; in them somewhere.  We could loop through our file

but no more than eleven digits.  If you put a single number in the braces,
the number specifies both the minimum and the maximum; that is, the

>There are a couple things about quantification that you need
to be careful of.  First of all, Perl quantifiers are by default
<em class="emphasis">greedy</EM
>.  This means that they will attempt to match as much as they
can as long as the entire expression still matches.  For example, if you
are matching <code class="literal">/\d+/</CODE
> against &quot;<code class="literal">1234567890</CODE
>&quot;, it will match the entire
string.  This is something to especially watch out for when you are using
&quot;<code class="literal">.</CODE
>&quot;, any character.  Often, someone will have a string like:</P
><p class="para"><pre class="programlisting">spp:Fe+H20=FeO2;H:2112:100:Stephen P Potter:/home/spp:/bin/tcsh</PRE
></P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1633"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1636"></A
>and try to match &quot;<code class="literal">spp:</CODE
>&quot; with
<code class="literal">/.+:/</CODE
>.  However, since the <code class="literal">+</CODE
>
quantifier is greedy, this pattern will match everything up to and
including &quot;<code class="literal">/home/spp:</CODE
>&quot;. Sometimes you can avoid
this by using a negated character class, that is, by saying <code class="literal">/[^:]+:/</CODE
>, which says
to match one or more non-colon characters (as many as possible), up to
the first colon.  It's that little caret in there that negates the sense
of the character class.[<a class="footnote" href="#AUTOID-1644">27</A
>]
The other point to be careful about is that regular expressions will try
to match as <em class="emphasis">early</EM
> as possible.  This even takes precedence over being
greedy.  Since scanning happens left-to-right, this means that the
pattern will match as far left as possible, even if there is some other
place where it could match longer.  (Regular expressions are greedy, but
they aren't into delayed gratification.)  For example, suppose you're
using the substitution command (<code class="literal">s///</CODE
>) on the default variable space
(variable <b class="emphasis.bold">$_</B
>, that is), and you want to remove a string of x's from
the middle of the string.  If you say:</P

<code class="literal">/\d+/</CODE
> and <code class="literal">/(\d+)/</CODE
> will still match as many digits as possible, but
in the latter case they will be remembered in a special variable to be
backreferenced later.</P
><p class="para">How you refer back to the remembered part of the string depends on where
you want to do it from.  Within the same regular expression, you
use a backslash followed by an integer.  The integer corresponding to a
given pair of parentheses is determined by counting left parentheses
from the beginning of the pattern, starting with one.  So for example, to
match something similar to an HTML tag (like &quot;<code class="literal">&lt;B&gt;Bold&lt;/B&gt;</CODE
>&quot;, you might
use <code class="literal">/&lt;(.*?)&gt;.*?&lt;\/\1&gt;/</CODE
>.  This forces the two parts of the
pattern to match the exact same string, such as the &quot;<code class="literal">B</CODE
>&quot; above.</P
><p class="para">Outside the regular expression itself, such as in the replacement
part of a substitution, the special variable is used as if it were a
normal scalar variable named by the integer.  So, if you wanted to swap
the first two words of a string, for example, you could use:</P
><p class="para"><pre class="programlisting">s/(\S+)\s+(\S+)/$2 $1/</PRE
></P
><p class="para">The right side of the substitution is really just a funny kind of
double-quoted string, which is why you can interpolate variables there,
including backreference variables.  This is a powerful concept:
interpolation (under controlled circumstances) is one of the reasons
Perl is a good text-processing language.  The other reason is the pattern
matching, of course.  Regular expressions are good for picking things apart,
and interpolation is good for putting things back together again.  Perhaps
there's hope for Humpty Dumpty after all.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1746"></A
