>Processes have almost as many ways of communicating as
people do.  But the difficulties of interprocess communication (IPC)
should not be underestimated.  It doesn't do you any good to listen for
verbal cues when your friend is using only body language.  Likewise, two
processes can communicate only when they agree on the method of
communication, and on the conventions built on top of that method.
These layered conventions often gain the weight of &quot;methodhood&quot;
themselves, so you'll sometimes hear people talking about <em class="emphasis">stacks</EM
> of
communication methods.  We can't hope to cover all the methods used
in the world today, but we'll discuss some of the methods most commonly
used in Perl.</P
><p class="para">The IPC facilities of Perl range from the very simple to the very
complex.  Which facility you want to use depends on the complexity of
the information to be communicated.  The simplest kind of information
is, in a sense, no information at all, but just the awareness that a
particular event has happened at a particular point in time.  In Perl,
these events are communicated via a signal mechanism modeled on the UNIX
signal system.</P
><p class="para">At the other extreme, the socket facilities of Perl allow you to
communicate with any other process on the Internet using any mutually
supported protocol you like.  Naturally, this freedom comes at a price:
you have to go through a number of steps to set up the connections and
make sure you're talking the same language as the process on the other
end, which may in turn require you to adhere to any number of other
strange customs, depending on the cultural conventions at work.  To be
protocoligorically correct, you might even be required to speak a
language like HTML, or Java, or Perl.  Horrors.</P
><p class="para">Sandwiched in between are some facilities intended primarily for
communicating between processes on the same machine.  These include
pipes, FIFOs, and the various System V IPC calls.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="PERL2-CH-6-SECT-2.1">6.2.1 Signals</A

>Perl uses a simple signal handling model: the <b class="emphasis.bold">%SIG</B
> hash contains
references (either symbolic or hard) to user-defined signal handlers.
When an event transpires, the handler corresponding to that event is
called with one argument containing the name of the signal that
triggered it.  In order to send a signal to another process, you use
the <a class="xref" href="ch03_080.htm#PERL2-CMD-KILL" title="kill"><b class="xref.cmd">kill</B
></A
> function.  If that process has installed a signal handler,
it can execute code when you send the signal, but there's no way to
get a return value (other than knowing that the signal was successfully
sent).</P
><p class="para">We've classified this facility as a form of IPC, but in fact, signals
can come from various sources, not just other processes.  A signal might
come from another process, or from your own process, or it might be
generated when the user at the keyboard types a particular sequence like
CTRL-C or CTRL-Z, or it might be manufactured by the kernel when
special events transpire, such as when a child process is exiting, or
when your process is running out of stack space, or hitting a file size
limit.[<a class="footnote" href="#AUTOID-17438">3</A
>]
But your own process can't easily distinguish among these
cases.  A signal is like a package that arrives mysteriously on your
doorstep with no return address.  You'd best open it carefully.</P

><p class="para">For example, to unpack an interrupt signal, set up a handler like this:</P

anything that needs to <em class="emphasis">malloc</EM

>The operating system thinks of signals as numbers rather than names.
To find the names of the signals, you can use the <code class="literal">kill -l</CODE

command on your system (if you're running UNIX).  Or you can retrieve
them from Perl's Config module; the following snippet sets up two arrays: a
<code class="literal">@signame</CODE

<code class="literal">%signo</CODE

On some systems, this function was broken; that is, it behaved in the
unreliable System V way rather than the reliable BSD (and POSIX)
fashion.  This meant that you had to reinstall the signal handler each
time it got called.[<a class="footnote" href="#AUTOID-17484">4</A

>While sockets were invented under UNIX, nowadays you can find them on
many other operating systems (though sometimes as an unbundled product).
If you don't have sockets on your machine, you're going to have difficulty
cooperating with processes on the Internet.  With sockets, you can do
both virtual circuits (that is, TCP streams) and datagrams (that is, UDP
packets).  You may be able to do even more, depending on your system.</P
><p class="para">The Perl function calls for dealing with sockets have the same names as
the corresponding system calls in C, but their arguments tend to differ
for two reasons: first, Perl filehandles work differently from C file
descriptors, and second, Perl already knows the length of its strings, so you
don't need to pass that information.  See <a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="Functions">Chapter 3</A
> for details on each
call.</P
><p class="para">Most of these routines quietly but politely return the undefined value
when they fail,
instead of causing your program to die right then and there due to an
uncaught exception.  (Actually, some of the new Socket module conversion
functions call <code class="literal">croak()</CODE
> on bad arguments.)  It is therefore essential
that you check the return values of these functions.  Always begin
your socket programs this way for optimal success (and don't forget to add
<b class="emphasis.bold">-T</B

><pre class="programlisting">#!/usr/bin/perl -w

><p class="para">All the socket routines create system-specific portability problems.  As noted
elsewhere, Perl is at the mercy of your C libraries for much of its system
behavior.  It's probably safest to assume broken System V semantics for
signals and to stick with simple TCP and UDP socket operations; for
example, don't
try to pass open file descriptors over a local UDP datagram socket if you
want your code to stand a chance of being portable.  (Yes, you can really
do that on some machines&nbsp;- see BSD in the Glossary.)</P
><p class="para">One of the major problems with ancient socket code in Perl was that it tended
to use hard-coded values for some of the constants, which severely hurt
portability.  If you ever see code that does anything like explicitly
setting <code class="literal">$AF_INET = 2</CODE
>, you know you're in for big trouble.  An
immeasurably superior approach is to use the Socket module, which more
reliably grants access to the various constants and functions you'll need.</P

even if you aren't running setuid or setgid.  This is always a good idea
for servers and other programs (like CGI scripts) that run on behalf of someone
else, because it lessens the chances that people from the outside will
be able to compromise your system.</P

>That's all fine for Internet-domain clients and servers, but what about
local communications?  While you can just pretend that your local
machine is remote, sometimes you don't want to.  UNIX-domain sockets are
local to the current host, and are often used internally to implement
pipes.  They tend to be a little more efficient than Internet-domain
sockets.  Unlike Internet-domain sockets, UNIX domain sockets can show
up in the file system with an <em class="emphasis">ls</EM

Because a FIFO doesn't give you sessions.  You
can't tell one process's data from another's.  With socket programming,
you get a separate session for each client&nbsp;- that's why <a class="xref" href="ch03_004.htm#PERL2-CMD-ACCEPT" title="accept"><b class="xref.cmd">accept</B

that you want folks from the World Wide Web to be able to access, but only
if they go through a CGI interface.  You'd have a small, simple CGI
program that does whatever checks and logging you feel like, and then acts
as a UNIX-domain client and proxies the request to your private server.</P

>Another kind of client-server setup is one that uses not connections, but
messages, or datagrams.  UDP communications involve much lower overhead but also provide
less reliability, since there are no promises that messages will arrive at
all, let alone in order and unmangled.  Still, UDP offers some advantages
over TCP, including being able to broadcast or multicast to a whole
bunch of destination hosts at once (usually on your local subnet).  If you
find yourself overly concerned about reliability and start building checks
into your message system, then you probably should just use TCP to start
with.</P
><p class="para">Here's a UDP program similar to the sample Internet TCP client given
above.  However, instead of checking one host at a time, the UDP version
will check many of them asynchronously by simulating a multicast and then
using <b class="emphasis.bold">select</B

with TCP, you'd have to use a different socket handle for each host.</P
