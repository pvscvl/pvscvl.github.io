RPG stood for Report Program Generator long before it stood for Role
Playing Game.)  Now, anyone who has written a program generator knows that it
can make your eyes go crossed even when you're wide awake.  The problem
is simply that much of your program's data looks like real code, but
isn't (at least not yet).  The same text file contains both stuff that does
something and similar looking stuff that doesn't.  Perl has various
features that make it easier to mix it together with other languages,
textually speaking.</P

Perl was redesigned for Version 5, however, one of the requirements was

developing a &quot;real compiler&quot; for Perl.  As of this writing, it's in
Alpha 2 state, which means it mostly works, except for the really hard
bits.  The compiler consists of an ordinary Perl parser and
interpreter (since you need to be able to execute <code class="literal">BEGIN</CODE

compile Perl), plus a set of modules under the name of B, which is short
for both &quot;Backend&quot; and &quot;Beattie&quot;.  You don't actually invoke the B
module directly though.  Instead you invoke a particular backend via the
O module, which pulls in the B module for you.  Typically you invoke the
O module right on the command line with the <b class="emphasis.bold">-M</B

compilation command might look like this:</P
><pre class="programlisting">perl -MO=C foo.pl &gt;foo.c</PRE
><p class="para">There are three backends at the moment.  The C backend rather woodenly
spits out C calls into the ordinary Perl interpreter, but it can
translate almost anything except the most egregious abuses of the
dynamic capabilities of the interpreter.  The Bytecode module is also
fairly complete, and spits out an external Perl bytecode representation,
which can then be read back in and executed by a suitably clued version
of Perl.  Finally, the CC backend attempts to translate into more
idiomatic C with a lot of optimization.  Obviously, that's a bit harder
to do than the other thing.  Nevertheless, it already works on a majority of
the Perl regression tests.  It's possible with some care to get C code
that runs considerably faster than Perl 5's interpreter, which is no
slouch to begin with.  And Malcolm hasn't put in all the optimizations
he wants to yet.</P
><p class="para">This is an ongoing topic of research, but you'll want to keep track of
it.  You are quite likely to be using this someday soon, if you aren't
already.  Look for it on CPAN of course, if it's not already a part
of the standard Perl distribution by the time you read this.</P

respectively compile and run the program.  If you were embedding Perl in
your own program, you might replace the call to <code class="literal">perl_run()</CODE

<code class="literal">perl_call_sv()</CODE

the program as a whole.  Or you can do both, if the main script contains
initialization code as well as subroutine definitions.</P
><p class="para">There are many other useful entry points into the interpreter, such as
<code class="literal">perl_eval_sv()</CODE

getting pretty long, and the fact of the matter is that there is
extensive online documentation for the internals of Perl.  To include it
here would make this book even more unwieldy than it is, and most people
who would be embedding Perl aren't scared of online documentation.  See
the <em class="emphasis">perlembed</EM
>(3) manpage for more on embedding Perl interpreters in your
program.</P
><p class="para">A number of programs in the real world already have Perl embedded in
them&nbsp;- the authors know of several proprietary products shipping with
embedded Perl interpreters.  There are also a couple of modules for the
<em class="emphasis">Apache</EM

process startup costs on CGI-like scripting.  And then there's the version

>If a respectable number of programs embed a Perl interpreter, then a
veritable flood of extension modules embed C and C++ into Perl.  Again,
the Perl distribution itself does this with many of its standard
extension modules, including DB_File, DynaLoader, Fcntl, FileHandle,
GDBM_File, NDBM_File, ODBM_File, POSIX, Safe, SDBM_File, and Socket.
And many of the modules on CPAN do this.  So if you decide to do it
yourself, you won't feel like you're researching a Ph.D. dissertation.</P
><p class="para">And again, we only have space to give you teasers for the online
documentation, which is exhaustively extensive.  We recommend you start
with the <em class="emphasis">perlxstut</EM
>(3) manpage, which is a tutorial on the XS
language, a preprocessor that spits out the glue routines you need to do
the &quot;impedance matching&quot; between Perl and C or C++.  You'll also be
interested in <em class="emphasis">perlxs</EM
>(3), <em class="emphasis">perlguts</EM
>(3), and <em class="emphasis">perlcall</EM
>(3).</P
><p class="para">And once again, let us reiterate that your best resource is the Perl
community itself.  They invented a lot of this stuff, and are emotionally
committed to making you like it, whether you like it or not.  You'd better
cooperate.</P
