>So far, except for our one large example, all of our examples have been
completely linear; we executed each command in order.  We've seen a few
examples of using the short circuit operators to cause a single command
to be (or not to be) executed.  While you can write some very useful
linear programs (a lot of CGI scripts fall into this category), you can
write much more powerful programs if you have conditional expressions
and looping mechanisms.  Collectively, these are known as control structures.
So you can also think of Perl as a control language.</P
><p class="para">But to have control, you have to be able to decide things, and to decide
things, you have to know the difference between what's true and what's false.</P

and we've mentioned that certain operators return a true or a false
value.  Before we go any further, we really ought to explain exactly
what we mean by that.  Perl treats truth a little differently than most
computer languages, but after you've worked with it awhile it will
make a lot of sense.  (Actually, we're hoping it'll make a lot of sense
after you've read the following.)</P

></DIV
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Basically, Perl holds truths to be self-evident.  That's a glib way of
saying that you can evaluate almost anything for its truth value.  Perl
uses practical definitions of truth that depend on the type of thing
you're evaluating.  As it happens, there are many more kinds of truth
than there are of nontruth.</P
><p class="para">Truth in Perl is always evaluated in a scalar context.  (Other than
that, no type coercion is done.)  So here are the rules for the various
kinds of values that a scalar can hold:</P
><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Any string is true except for <code class="literal">&quot;&quot;</CODE
> and <code class="literal">&quot;0&quot;</CODE
>.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Any number is true except for 0.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Any reference is true.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Any undefined value is false.</P
></LI
></OL
><p class="para">Actually, the last two rules can be derived from the first two.  Any
reference (rule 3) points to something with an address, and would
evaluate to a number or string containing that address, which is never
0.  And any undefined value (rule 4) would always evaluate to 0 or the
null string.</P
><p class="para">And in a way, you can derive rule 2 from rule 1 if you pretend that
everything is a string.  Again, no coercion is actually done to evaluate
truth, but if a coercion to string <em class="emphasis">were</EM
> done, then any numeric value
of 0 would simply turn into the string <code class="literal">&quot;0&quot;</CODE
>, and be false.  Any other
number would not turn into the string <code class="literal">&quot;0&quot;</CODE
>, and so would be true.  Let's
look at some examples so we can understand this better:</P
><pre class="programlisting">0          # would become the string &quot;0&quot;, so false
1          # would become the string &quot;1&quot;, so true
10 - 10    # 10-10 is 0, would convert to string &quot;0&quot;, so false
0.00       # becomes 0, would convert to string &quot;0&quot;, so false
&quot;0&quot;        # the string &quot;0&quot;, so false
&quot;&quot;         # a null string, so false
&quot;0.00&quot;     # the string &quot;0.00&quot;, neither empty nor exactly &quot;0&quot;, so true
&quot;0.00&quot; + 0 # the number 0 (coerced by the +), so false.
\$a        # a reference to $a, so true, even if $a is false
undef()    # a function returning the undefined value, so false</PRE
><p class="para">Since we mumbled something earlier about truth being evaluated in a
scalar context, you might be wondering what the truth value of a list
is.  Well, the simple fact is, there <em class="emphasis">is</EM
> no operation in Perl that will
return a list in a scalar context.  They all return a scalar value
instead, and then you apply the rules of truth to that scalar.  So
there's no problem, as long as you can figure out what any given
operator will return in a scalar context.</P

A slightly more complex form of the logic operators is the <b class="emphasis.bold">if</B

executes a block if the condition is true.</P
><p class="para">A block is one or more statements grouped together by a set of
braces.  Since the <b class="emphasis.bold">if</B

required by definition.  If you know a language like C, you'll notice
that this is different.  Braces are optional in C if you only have a

negation of the other, Perl provides a more elegant solution.  After
the block, <b class="emphasis.bold">if</B

to be executed only if the truth condition is false.  (Veteran computer
programmers will not be surprised at this point.)</P

case, you'll want to add an <b class="emphasis.bold">elsif</B

by the spelling of &quot;elsif&quot;, for which nobody here is going to apologize.

earlier, returns the value of <code class="literal">$line</CODE

whether Perl will get a false negative on blank lines and exit the
loop prematurely.  The answer is that it won't.  The reason is clear, if
you think about everything we've said.  The line input operator leaves the
newline on the end of the string, so a blank line has the value <code class="literal">&quot;\n&quot;</CODE
>.
And you know that <code class="literal">&quot;\n&quot;</CODE
> is not one of the canonical false values.  So
the condition is true, and the loop continues even on blank lines.</P
><p class="para">On the other hand, when we finally do reach the end of the file, the
line input operator returns the undefined value, which always evaluates to
false.  And the loop terminates, just when we wanted it to.  There's no
need for an explicit test against the <a class="xref" href="ch03_031.htm#PERL2-CMD-EOF" title="eof"><b class="xref.cmd">eof</B

input operators are designed to work smoothly in a conditional context.</P

truth condition is checked.  If the condition is true, the block is executed.  When
the block finishes, the modification expression is executed, the truth
condition is again checked, and if true, the block is rerun with the
