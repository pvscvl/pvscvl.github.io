It has come to my attention that there is a crying need for a
place for people to express both their emotional and technical
natures simultaneously.  Several people have sent me some items
which don't fit into any newsgroup.  Perhaps it's because I
recently posted to both comp.lang.perl and to rec.arts.poems,
but people seem to be writing poems in Perl, and they're
asking me where they should post them.  Here is a sampling:

From a graduate student (in finals week), the following haiku:

    study, write, study,
    do review (each word) if time.
    close book.  sleep?  what's that?

And someone writing from Fort Lauderdale writes:

    sleep, close together,
    sort of sin each spring & wait;
    50% die

A person who wishes to remain anonymous wrote the following
example of "Black Perl".  (The Pearl poet would have been
shocked, no doubt.)

BEFOREHAND: close door, each window & exit;  wait until time.
    open spellbook, study, read (scan, select, tell us);
write it, print the hex while each watches,
    reverse its length, write again;
	kill spiders, pop them, chop, split, kill them.
	   unlink arms, shift, wait & listen (listening, wait),
sort the flock (then, warn the "goats" & kill the "sheep");
    kill them, dump qualms, shift moralities,
	values aside, each one;
	    die sheep! die to reverse the system
		you accept (reject, respect);
next step,
    kill the next sacrifice, each sacrifice,
	wait, redo ritual until "all the spirits are pleased";
    do it ("as they say").
do it(*everyone***must***participate***in***forbidden**s*e*x*).
return last victim; package body;
    exit crypt (time, times & "half a time") & close it,
	select (quickly) & warn your next victim;
AFTERWORDS: tell nobody.
    wait, wait until time;
	wait until next year, next decade;
	    sleep, sleep, die yourself,
		die at last

I tried that, and it actually parses in Perl.  It doesn't
appear to do anything useful, however.  I think I'm glad,
actually...

I hereby propose the creation of comp.lang.perl.poems as a
place for such items, so we don't clutter the perl or poems
newsgroups with things that may be of interest to neither.
Or, alternately, we should create rec.arts.poems.perl for
items such as those above which merely parse, and don't do
anything useful.  (There is precedent in rec.arts.poems,
after all.)  Then also create comp.lang.perl.poems for poems
that actually do something, such as this haiku of my own:

print STDOUT q
Just another Perl hacker,
unless $spring
