>If a reference happens to be a reference to an object (a blessed thingy,
that is), then there are probably methods to access the innards of the
object, and you should probably stick to those methods unless you're
writing the class package that defines the object's methods.  (Such a
package is allowed to treat the object as a mere thingy when it wants
to.)  In other words, be nice, and don't violate the object's
encapsulation without a very good reason.  Perl does not enforce
encapsulation.  We are not totalitarians here.  We do expect some basic
civility, however.</P

The value returned depends on the type of thing referenced.
Built-in types include:</P

SCALAR
ARRAY
HASH
CODE
GLOB</PRE
><p class="para">If you simply use a hard reference in a string context, it'll be converted
to a string containing both the type and the address: <code class="literal">SCALAR(0x1fc0e)</CODE

information has been lost.)</P

reference used in a string context returns a string with both the
external and internal types, along with the address:

><p class="para">It works like this.  At compile time, when the <code class="literal">@{...}</CODE
> is seen
within the double-quoted string, it's parsed as a block that will return
a reference.  Within the block, there are square brackets that will
create a reference to an anonymous array from whatever is in the
brackets.  So at run-time, <code class="literal">mysub(1,2,3)</CODE
> is called, and the
results are loaded into an anonymous array, a reference to which is then
returned within the block.  That array reference is then immediately
dereferenced by the surrounding <code class="literal">@{...}</CODE
>, and the array value is
interpolated into the double-quoted string just as an ordinary array
would be.  This chicanery is also useful for arbitrary expressions,
such as:</P
><pre class="programlisting">print &quot;That yields @{[ $n + 5 ]} widgets\n&quot;;</PRE
><p class="para">Be careful though.  The inside of the square brackets is supplying a
list context to its expression.  In this case it doesn't matter,
although it's possible that the above call to <code class="literal">mysub()</CODE
> might care.
When it does matter, a similar trick can be done with a scalar
reference.  It just isn't quite as pretty:</P

>Earlier we talked about creating anonymous subroutines with a nameless
<code class="literal">sub {}</CODE
>.  Since anonymous subroutines have to be
generated someplace within your code (in order to generate the
reference that you poke into some variable), such routines can be
thought of as coming into existence at run-time.  (That is, they have a
time of generation as well as a location of definition.)  Because of
this fact, anonymous subroutines can act as <em class="emphasis">closures</EM
>
with respect to <a class="xref" href="ch03_097.htm#PERL2-CMD-MY" title="my"><b class="xref.cmd">my</B

> variables&nbsp;- that
is, with respect to variables visible lexically within the current
scope.  Closure is a notion out of the Lisp world that says if you
define an anonymous function in a particular lexical context at a
particular moment, it pretends to run in that context even when it's
called outside of the context.  In other words, you are guaranteed to
get the same copy of a lexical variable, even
though many other instances of the same lexical variable may have been
created before or since.  This gives you a way to pass arguments to a
subroutine when you define it as well as when you call it.  It's
useful for setting up little bits of code to run later, such as
callbacks.</P
><p class="para">You can also think of closures as a way to write a subroutine template without
using <a class="xref" href="ch03_032.htm#PERL2-CMD-EVAL" title="eval"><b class="xref.cmd">eval</B

the template. </P

created nor destroyed the way lexical variables are). By and large,
closures are not something you need to trouble yourself about.

similar effect using a closure.  Suppose you want a pointer to a
