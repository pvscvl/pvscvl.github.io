><p class="para">Finally, and most importantly, you must learn how to use objects and classes. Although building your own object module is beyond the scope of this book, you don't have to know about that in order to use existing, object-oriented library modules.

><p class="para">We won't go into the theory behind objects here, but you can just treat them as packages (which they are!) of wonderful and marvelous things that you invoke indirectly. Objects provide subroutines that do anything you need to do with the object. </P
><p class="para">For instance, suppose the <em class="emphasis">CGI.pm</EM

><p class="para">Objects look like scalars; you store them in scalar variables (like <code class="literal">$query</CODE

><p class="para">The type of a particular object is known as its <em class="emphasis">class</EM

><p class="para">You access classes by loading in a module, which looks just like any other module except that object-oriented ones don't usually export anything. You can think of the class as a factory that cranks out brand-new objects. To get the class to produce one of these new objects, you invoke special methods called <em class="emphasis">constructors</EM

><pre class="programlisting">$query = CGI-&gt;new(); # call method new() in class &quot;CGI&quot;</PRE

> <code class="literal">method</CODE
> (which is what we were talking about a moment ago), except that instead of using an object to call the method, you use the name of the class as though it were itself an object. An object method is saying "call the function by this name that is related to this object"; a class method is saying "call the function by this name that is related to this class." </P
><p class="para">Sometimes you'll see that same thing written this way: </P

><p class="para">The second form is identical in behavior to the first. It's got less punctuation, so is sometimes preferred. But it's less convenient to use as part of a larger expression, so we'll use the first form exclusively in this book. </P
><p class="para">From the standpoint of the designer of object modules, an object is a reference to a user-defined data structure, often an anonymous hash. Inside this structure is stored all manner of interesting information. But the well-behaved user of an object is expected to get at this information (to inspect or change it), not by treating the object as a reference and going straight for the data it points to, but by employing only the available object and class methods. Changing the object's data by other means amounts to hanky-panky that is bound to get you talked about. To learn what those methods are and how they work, just read the object module's documentation, usually included as embedded pods. </P

><p class="para">The CGI module is unusual in that it can be treated either as a traditional module with exported functions or as an object module. Some kinds of programs are more easily written using the object interface to <em class="emphasis">CGI.pm</EM

><p class="para">We'll show you the program and explain its details in a moment. Let's assume that the program is named <em class="emphasis">guestbook.plx</EM

While this program does not look like one of the two-part scripts shown earlier (where one part outputs an HTML form, and the other part reads and responds to form input from a user), you will see that it nevertheless does handle both functions. So you do not need a separate HTML document containing a guestbook form. The user might first trigger our program simply by clicking on a link like this: </P

><p class="para">Users can sit with the guestbook form, continually typing messages and pressing the submit button. This method simulates an electronic bulletin-board system, letting users see each other's new messages each time they send off their own. When they do this, they call the same CGI program repeatedly, which means that the previous widget values are automatically retained between invocations. This result is particularly convenient when creating multistage forms, such as those used in so-called "shopping cart" applications. </P
