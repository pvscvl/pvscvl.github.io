The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is an essential tool for creating
and managing comprehensive web sites. 
With CGI, you can write scripts that create interactive,
user-driven applications. </P
><p class="para">CGI allows the web server to communicate with
other programs that are running on the same machine. For example, with CGI, 
the web server
can invoke an external program, while passing user-specific data to the
program (such as what host the user is connecting from, or input
the user has supplied through an HTML form). The program
then processes that data, and the server passes the program's
response back to the web browser.</P
><p class="para">Rather than limiting the Web to documents written ahead of time, 
CGI enables web pages to be created on the fly, based upon the input
of users. You can use CGI scripts to create a wide
range of applications, from surveys to search tools, from Internet
service gateways to quizzes and games. 
You can increment the number of users who access a document or
let them sign an electronic guestbook. You can provide users
with all types of information, collect their comments, and respond
to them. </P
><p class="para">For Perl programmers, there are two approaches you can take
to CGI.  They are:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Programs that handle all CGI interaction directly, without
the use of a module such as CGI.pm.  While often frowned upon by
Perl programmers because it's more likely to 
introduce bugs, bypassing the modules has the advantage 
of avoiding the overhead of CGI.pm for quick, dirty tasks.
This chapter explains the concepts of CGI
necessary if you intend to write CGI programs from scratch.  </P

For non-trivial CGI programs, especially ones that need to

tag. The GET method says to transfer the data within the URL 
itself;  for
example, under the GET method, the browser might initiate the HTTP

In both of these examples, you should recognize the <code class="literal">firstname</CODE

<code class="literal">lastname</CODE

coupled with the values entered by the user. An ampersand (&amp;) is
used to separate the variable=value pairs. </P
><p class="para">The server now passes the variable=value pairs to the CGI program.
It does this either through Unix environment variables or in
standard input (STDIN). 
If the CGI program is called with the GET method, then parameters 
are expected to be embedded into the URL of the request, and
the server transfers them to the program by assigning them to the<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-24076"></A
>
QUERY_STRING environment variable. The CGI program can then 
retrieve the parameters from QUERY_STRING as it would read any
environment variable (for example, from the <code class="literal">%ENV</CODE
> hash in Perl).
If the CGI program is called
with the POST method, parameters are expected to be embedded
into the body of the request, and the server passes the body text
to the program as standard input (STDIN). </P
><p class="para">Other environment variables defined by the server for CGI
store such information as the format and length 
of the input, the remote host, the user, and various client
information. They also store the server name, the communication
protocol, and the name of the software running the server.
(We provide a list of the most common CGI environment variables 
later in this chapter.)</P
><p class="para">The CGI program needs to retrieve the information as appropriate
and then process it. The sky's the limit on what the CGI 
program actually does with the information it retrieves.
It might return
an anagram of the user's name, or tell her how many times her
name uses the letter &quot;t,&quot; or it might just compile the name into
a list that the programmer regularly sells to telemarketers. 
Only the programmer knows for sure.</P

>Regardless of what the CGI program does with its input, 
it's responsible for giving the browser
something to display when it's done.
It must either create
a new document to be served
to the browser or point to an existing document. On Unix,
programs send their output to standard output (STDOUT) as
a data stream that consists of two parts. The first
part is either a full or
partial HTTP header that (at minimum) describes the format
of the returned data (e.g., HTML, ASCII text, GIF, etc.). A blank line signifies the end of the header section.
The second part is the body of the output, which contains
the data conforming to the format type reflected in the header.
For example:


<blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">Content-type: text/html
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Thanks!&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;H1&gt;Thanks for signing my guest book!&lt;/H1&gt;
	...
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE

<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-24089"></A
>
In this case, the only header line generated is 
Content-type, which gives the media format of the output 
as HTML (<code class="literal">text/html</CODE
>).
This line is essential for every CGI program, since 
it tells the browser what kind of format to expect.
The blank line separates the header from the body text (which,
in this case, is in HTML format as advertised). </P
><p class="para">The server transfers the results of the CGI program back to the
browser. 
The body text is not modified or interpreted by the server in 
any way, but
the server generally supplies additional headers 
with information such as the date, the name and version of
the server, etc. </P
><p class="para">CGI programs can also supply a complete HTTP header itself, 
in which case the server does not add any additional headers but instead 
transfers the response verbatim as returned by the CGI program.
The server needs to be configured to allow this behavior; see your
server documentation on NPH (no-parsed headers) scripts for more
information.</P
><p class="para">Here is the sample output of a program generating an HTML
virtual document, with a complete HTTP header:


<blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date:  Thursday, 28-June-96 11:12:21 GMT
Server: NCSA/1.4.2
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 2041

&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Thanks!&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Thanks for signing my guestbook!&lt;/H1&gt;
 	...
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
>


The header contains the communication protocol, the date and time
of the response, and the server name and version.
(<code class="literal">200 OK</CODE
> is a status code generated by the HTTP
protocol to communicate the status of a request, in this case
successful.)
Most importantly, the header also contains the  content type and
the number of characters (equivalent to the number of bytes)
of the enclosed data.</P
><p class="para">The result is that after users click the &quot;submit&quot; button, 
they see the message contained in the HTML section of the response
thanking them for signing the guestbook.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-24098"></A
