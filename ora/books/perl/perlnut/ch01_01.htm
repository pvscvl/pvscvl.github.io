><p class="para">Computer languages differ not so much in what they
make possible, but in what they make easy.  
Perl is designed to make the easy
jobs easy, without making the hard jobs impossible.
Perl makes it easy to
manipulate numbers, text, files, directories, computers,
networks, and programs.  It also makes it easy to develop, modify, and
debug your own programs portably, on any modern operating
system.</P
><p class="para">Perl is especially popular with systems programmers and web
developers, but it also appeals to a much broader audience.  
Originally designed for text processing, it has grown 
into a sophisticated, general-purpose
programming language with a rich software development environment
complete with debuggers, profilers, cross-referencers, compilers,
interpreters, libraries, syntax-directed editors, and all the 
rest of the trappings of a &quot;real&quot; programming language.  </P
><p class="para">There are many reasons for Perl's success.  For starters,
Perl is freely available and freely redistributable.  But
that's not enough to explain the Perl phenomenon, since many other
freeware
packages fail to thrive.  Perl is not just free; it's also fun.  People
feel like they can be creative in Perl, because they have freedom of
expression.</P
><p class="para">Perl is both a very simple language
and a very rich language.  
It's a simple language in that the types and structures 
are simple to use and understand, and it borrows heavily
from other languages you may already be familiar with.
You don't have to know everything there is to know about
Perl before you can write useful programs.  </P
><p class="para">However, Perl is also a rich language, and there is
much to learn about it.  That's the price of making hard things
possible.  Although it will take some time for you to absorb all that
Perl can do, somewhere down the line you will be glad that you 
have access to the extensive
capabilities of Perl.</P
><div class="sect1"><h2 class="sect1"><a class="title" name="PNUT-CH-1-SECT-1">1.1 What's Perl Good For?</A
></H2
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="PNUT-CH-1-IX-PERL-LANGUAGE-USES-OF"></A
>Perl has the advantage of being easy to learn if you just want to 
write simple scripts&nbsp;- thus its appeal to the ever-impatient
system administrator and the deadline-driven CGI developer.  
However, as you become more ambitious, Perl lets you act
on those ambitions.  <a class="xref" href="ch02_01.htm" title="Installing Perl">Chapter 2, <cite class="chapter">Installing Perl</CITE
></A
>, covers how to get and
install Perl, and <a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="The Perl Interpreter">Chapter 3, <cite class="chapter">The Perl Interpreter</CITE
></A
>, through <a class="xref" href="ch06_01.htm" title="Debugging">Chapter 6, <cite class="chapter">Debugging</CITE
></A
>,
cover the basics of the Perl language, its functions, and
how to use the Perl debugger.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-170"></A
>On top of the Perl language itself, however, are 
the Perl modules.  You can think of modules
as add-ons to the Perl language that allow you to 
streamline tasks by providing a consistent API.  
Perl itself is fun to use, but the modules lend Perl 
even more
flexibility and enormous power.  Furthermore, anyone can
write and distribute a Perl module.  Some modules are deemed
important enough or popular enough to be distributed
with Perl itself, but very few are actually written by
the core Perl developers themselves.  
<a class="xref" href="ch07_01.htm" title="Packages, Modules, and Objects">Chapter 7, <cite class="chapter">Packages, Modules, and Objects</CITE
></A
>, introduces you to
Perl modules, and <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Standard Modules">Chapter 8, <cite class="chapter">Standard Modules</CITE
></A
>, covers the standard modules that are
distributed with Perl itself.  </P
><p class="para">The most popular Perl module is CGI.pm, which
gives a simple interface to developing CGI (common gateway interface)
applications in Perl.  While Perl itself is indispensable for many 
different tasks, its text-manipulation features make it perfect 
for CGI development
on the Web. In fact, 
the resurgence of Perl over the past few years must be
credited to its popularity as a CGI language.
<a class="xref" href="ch10_01.htm" title="The CGI.pm Module">Chapter 10, <cite class="chapter">The CGI.pm Module</CITE
></A
>, and <a class="xref" href="ch11_01.htm" title="Web Server Programming with mod_perl">Chapter 11, <cite class="chapter">Web Server Programming with mod_perl</CITE
></A
>, talk about using Perl for CGI,
including <em class="emphasis">mod_perl</EM
>, which merges Perl into the
Apache web server.</P
><p class="para">Database interconnectivity is
one of the most important functions of any 
programming language today,
and Perl is no exception.  DBI is a suite of modules that provide
a consistent database-independent interface for Perl.  
<a class="xref" href="ch12_01.htm" title="Databases and Perl">Chapter 12, <cite class="chapter">Databases and Perl</CITE
></A
>, covers both DBI and DBM (the more primitive
but surprisingly effective database interface built 
directly into Perl).</P
><p class="para">The Internet doesn't start and stop at CGI. Network programming
is another of Perl's strengths, with a robust sockets interface
and several modules for writing clients and servers for all
sorts of Internet services&nbsp;- not only the Web, but also
email, news, FTP, etc.  <a class="xref" href="ch13_01.htm" title="Sockets">Chapter 13, <cite class="chapter">Sockets</CITE
></A
>, through <a class="xref" href="ch17_01.htm" title="The LWP Library">Chapter 17, <cite class="chapter">The LWP Library</CITE
></A
>,
cover the modules for developing fully functional
Internet applications in Perl.</P
><p class="para">Perl programs are traditionally command-line-based, but 
the Perl/Tk extension can provide Perl programs with graphical
user interfaces, for both Unix and Microsoft Windows.
<a class="xref" href="ch18_01.htm" title="Perl/Tk">Chapter 18, <cite class="chapter">Perl/Tk</CITE
></A
>, gives a complete reference to Perl/Tk.</P
><p class="para">Finally, although Perl is primarily developed for Unix, recent
releases of Perl for Windows 95 and Windows NT are
gaining popularity, both for CGI and system administration
tasks.  <a class="xref" href="ch19_01.htm" title="Win32 Modules and Extensions">Chapter 19, <cite class="chapter">Win32 Modules and Extensions</CITE
></A
>, covers the Win32 modules for Perl.
Web developers on Win32 machines can use a 
variation of Perl called PerlScript, for JavaScript-like
programming over the Web.  <a class="xref" href="ch20_01.htm" title="PerlScript">Chapter 20, <cite class="chapter">PerlScript</CITE
></A
>, gives an introduction
to PerlScript and summarizes its syntax and functions.</P
><p class="para">As you may have noticed, this section entitled &quot;What's Perl Good For&quot;
has sneakily become a description of the contents of this book.
This book aims at being a general-purpose reference to all things
