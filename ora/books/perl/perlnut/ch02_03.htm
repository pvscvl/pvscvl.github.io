once you've downloaded the distribution, you need to uncompress and unpack

massive shell script called <em class="emphasis">Configure</EM

figure out everything about your system and creates the file <em class="emphasis">Config.pm</EM

to store the information.  After this is done, you do a
series of &quot;makes&quot; to find header file dependencies, to compile
Perl (and <em class="emphasis">a2p</EM

run regression tests, and to install Perl in your system directories.</P
><p class="para">One common problem is not making sure that Perl is linked against all
the libraries it needs to build correctly.  Also, you should say &quot;yes&quot;
when <em class="emphasis">Configure</EM

supports it.
Otherwise, you won't be able to install modules that use XS, which
provides an interface between Perl and C.</P

a complete MakeMaker, which you need for installing modules. To be safe,
you should make sure everything is there; one way to do that is to check the

to build Perl yourself.</P

these files in the directories that your version was compiled for.
Note that binary distributions of Perl are made available because they're
handy, not because you are restricted from getting the source and
compiling it yourself. The people who give you the binary
distribution ought to provide you with some form of access to the
source, if only a pointer to where <em class="emphasis">they</EM

actually the standard Perl distribution&nbsp;- Perl 5.004 added support for
Win32 systems to the standard Perl distribution. In Perl 5.004, the
two versions are
largely compatible, with some of the Perl 5.004 code being based on
the ActiveState port. However, there are also some differences: using either
the ISAPI version of Perl or PerlScript with 5.004 requires the
ActiveState distribution. On the other hand, the Win32 ports of
<em class="emphasis">mod_perl</EM

><p class="para">With Perl 5.005, this scenario has changed, and the two versions have been 
merged. If you look on CPAN, you'll see that there still seem to be
two versions&nbsp;- the ActiveState distribution, now known as ActivePerl, and the 
standard distribution.  The difference is that they are now based on the
same source code.  Get ActivePerl if you want to install from a binary
distribution or get the standard distribution to build Perl from the
