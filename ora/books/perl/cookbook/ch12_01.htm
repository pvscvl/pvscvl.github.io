><p class="para">Imagine that you have two separate programs, both of which work fine by themselves, and you decide to make a third program that combines the best features from the first two. You copy both programs into a new file or cut and paste selected pieces. You find that the two programs had variables and functions with the same names that should remain separate. For example, both might have an <code class="literal">init</CODE
> function or a global <code class="literal">$count</CODE

><p class="para">The solution to this problem is <em class="emphasis">packages</EM

>. Perl uses packages to partition the global namespace. The package is the basis for both traditional modules and object-oriented classes. Just as directories contain files, packages contain identifiers. Every global identifier (variables, functions, file and directory handles, and formats) has two parts: its package name and the identifier proper. These two pieces are separated from one another with a double colon. For example, the variable <code class="literal">$CGI::needs_binmode</CODE
> is a global variable named <code class="literal">$needs_binmode</CODE
>, which resides in package <code class="literal">CGI</CODE
>.</P
><p class="para">Where the filesystem uses slashes to separate the directory from the filename, Perl uses a double colon (prior to release 5.000, you could only use a single quote mark, as in <code class="literal">$CGI'needs_bin_mode</CODE
>). <code class="literal">$Names::startup</CODE
> is the variable named <code class="literal">$startup</CODE
> in the package <code class="literal">Names</CODE
>, whereas <code class="literal">$Dates::startup</CODE
> is the <code class="literal">$startup</CODE
> variable in package <code class="literal">Dates</CODE

>The unit of software reuse in Perl is the <em class="emphasis">module</EM
>, a file that has a collection of related functions designed to be used by other programs and library modules. Every module has a public interface, a set of variables and functions that outsiders are encouraged to use. From inside the module, the interface is defined by initializing certain package variables that the standard Exporter module looks at. From outside the module, the interface is accessed by importing symbols as a side effect of the <code class="literal">use</CODE
> statement. The public interface of a Perl module is whatever is documented to be public. In the case of undocumented interfaces, it's whatever is vaguely intended to be public. When we talk about modules in this chapter, and traditional modules in general, we mean those that use the Exporter.</P

> loads modules at runtime, with a check to avoid the redundant loading of a given module. <code class="literal">use</CODE

>, with two added properties: compile-time loading and automatic importing.</P
><p class="para">Modules included with <code class="literal">use</CODE

> processing happens at run time. This is important because if a module that a program needs is missing, the program won't even start because the <code class="literal">use</CODE
> fails during compilation of your script. Another advantage of compile-time <code class="literal">use</CODE
> over run-time <code class="literal">require</CODE
> is that function prototypes in the module's subroutines become visible to the compiler. This matters because only the compiler cares about prototypes, not the interpreter. (Then again, we don't usually recommend prototypes except for replacing built-in commands, which do have them.)</P
><p class="para"><code class="literal">use</CODE
> is suitable for giving hints to the compiler because of its compile-time behavior. A <em class="emphasis">pragma</EM
><a class="indexterm" name="ch12-idx-1000005131-0"></A
> is a special module that acts as directive to the compiler to alter how Perl compiles your code. A pragma's name is always all lowercase, so when writing a regular module instead of a pragma, choose a name that starts with a capital letter. Pragmas supported by Perl 5.004 include autouse, constant, diagnostics, integer, lib, locale, overload, sigtrap, strict, subs, and vars. Each has its own manpage.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="ch12-idx-1000005132-0"></A
>The other difference between <code class="literal">require</CODE
> and <code class="literal">use</CODE

> performs an implicit <em class="emphasis">import</EM

It's like linking in files from another directory to your current one by the command <em class="emphasis">ln /somedir/somefile.</EM
> Once it's linked in, you no longer have to use the full pathname to access the file. Likewise, an imported symbol no longer needs to be fully qualified by package name (or predeclared with <code class="literal">use</CODE
> <code class="literal">vars</CODE
> or <code class="literal">use</CODE
> <code class="literal">subs</CODE
>). You can use imported variables as though they were part of your package. If you imported <code class="literal">$English::OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH</CODE
