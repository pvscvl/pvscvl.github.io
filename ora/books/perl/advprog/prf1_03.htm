>Pointers or references bring an enormous sophistication to the type of data structures you can create with a language. Perl's support for references and its ability to let you code without having to specify every single step makes it an especially powerful language. For example, you can create something as elaborate as an array of hashes of arrays[<a class="footnote" href="#ch00-pgfId-952801">4</A

><p class="para">Perl supports references to subroutines and a powerful construct called closures, which, as LISPers know, is essentially an unnamed subroutine that carries its environment around with it.

>Perl interpreter. There are two main reasons for delving into this internal aspect of Perl. One is to extend Perl, by which I mean adding a C module that can do things for which Perl is not well-suited or is not fast enough. The other is to embed Perl in C, so that a C program can invoke Perl for a specific task such as handling a regular expression substitution, which you may not want to code up in C.</P

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="ch00-pgfId-945191">Technology Areas</A
></H3
><p class="para">I am of the opinion that an applications developer should master at least the following six major technology areas: user interfaces, persistence, interprocess communication and networking, parsing and code generation, the Web, and the operating system. This book presents detailed explanations of the first four topics (in Chapters <a class="xref" href="ch10_01.htm" title="Persistence">Chapter 10, <cite class="chapter">Persistence</CITE
></A
> through <a class="xref" href="ch17_01.htm" title="Template-Driven Code Generation">Chapter 17</A
>). Instead of just presenting the API of publicly available modules, the book starts with real problems and develops useful solutions, including appropriate Perl packages. For example, <a class="xref" href="ch13_01.htm" title="Networking: Implementing RPC">Chapter 13, <cite class="chapter">Networking: Implementing RPC</CITE
></A
>, explains the implementation of an RPC toolkit that avoids deadlocks even if two processes happen to call each other at the same time. As another example, <a class="xref" href="ch11_01.htm" title="Implementing Object Persistence">Chapter 11</A
>, develops an "adaptor" to transparently send a collection of objects to a persistent store of your choice (relational database, plain file, or DBM file) and implements querying on all of them. </P
><p class="para">This book does not deal with operating system specific issues, partly because Perl hides a tremendous number of these differences and partly because these details will distract us from the core themes of the book. Practically all the code in this book is OS-neutral.</P
><p class="para">I have chosen to ignore web-related issues and, more specifically, CGI. This is primarily because there are numerous books[<a class="footnote" href="#ch00-pgfId-951664">5</A
>] and tutorials on CGI scripting with Perl that do more justice to this subject than the limited space on this book can afford. In addition, developers of most interesting CGI applications will spend much more time with the concepts presented in this book than with the simple details of the CGI protocol per se<i class="foreignphrase">.</I
