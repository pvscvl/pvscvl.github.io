>Perl automatically manages the memory allocated for user-defined variables, while C expects the programmer to spell out everything. This issue is especially important when data crosses the Perl-C interface. Unfortunately, a C function's signature gives no clue about its memory management protocol; it is difficult for humans to divine it, let alone automated tools such as SWIG and XS. Let us assume that the C matrix library stores its data as a series of Vector objects internally (each row is represented as a Vector), and that <kbd class="command">matrix_get_row</KBD
> returns the Vector corresponding to that row. As you can see, both <kbd class="command">new_matrix</KBD
> and <kbd class="command">matrix_get_row</KBD
> return a pointer to an object, but in the first case, the caller is expected to take ownership of the object (delete it when it is no longer required), and in the latter, the matrix library owns the memory. While the extension tools provide certain default choices, you have to be constantly on the watch. You should also ensure that the appropriate function deletes the memory&nbsp;- <kbd class="command">free</KBD
>, <kbd class="command">delete</KBD
>, or <kbd class="command">delete[]</KBD
>, for objects allocated by <kbd class="command">malloc</KBD

>C header files (such as <i class="filename">Matrix.h</I

You are typically not interested in making everything available to a Perl script; there's nothing worse than attempting C programming in Perl. In most cases, it suffices to export a subset of public functions, and some constants (which are available as initialized variables, <kbd class="command">#define</KBD

>SWIG expects you, the extension developer, to boil the interface down to a still simpler form and express it in its interface definition language. Fortunately, this language is close enough to ANSI C and simple C++ that a large number of header files don't need any translation at all. From the interface description, SWIG generates the glue code; in the Matrix case, it will be <i class="filename">Matrix.pm</I
> and <i class="filename">Matrix_wrap.c</I
>. If your system supports dynamic linking (shared libraries on Unix, and DLLs on Windows), and if the Perl executable has been built to use it, all that is left to be done is to convert the glue code and your C library into a dynamic library. If dynamic linking is not an option, then a new Perl executable is generated by statically linking the Perl archive library (<i class="filename">libperl.a</I
> on Unix or <i class="filename">perl.lib</I
> on Microsoft Windows) with the pieces of code mentioned above.</P

The XS language is a mixture of C and funny keywords and provides directives for you to override the glue code produced by <em class="emphasis">xsubpp</EM

><p class="para">Incidentally, the code generated by both tools is quite similar, and it is perfectly acceptable to have some extensions built using the XS approach and some using SWIG. Which brings us to the question: which one should you use?<a class="indexterm" name="ch18-idx-971900-0"></A

>Differences in SWIG's and XS's features spring from differences in their design goals. SWIG is designed to help create a scripting language wrapper over a C library and supports Python, Tcl, and Guile in addition to Perl. In contrast, XS is designed only for Perl and allows for a number of Perlisms that SWIG cannot easily generalize to the other languages.</P
><p class="para">I prefer SWIG to the XS approach because it <em class="emphasis">feels</EM
> a lot cleaner, is far less internals-oriented than XS is, and supports multiple languages. In addition, it has excellent support for data structures (not just functions), whereas XS supports only functions. I build C++ and Java applications for a living, so my focus is typically more on the application than on the scripting frontend&nbsp;- I leave the choice of scripting language to the user. Your mileage may vary. </P
><p class="para">You'll find that <em class="emphasis">all</EM
> modules in the Perl distribution and on CPAN are currently written by using XS. The chief reason is that XS comes bundled with Perl. Besides, it has supported powerful features such as typemaps since its inception, whereas SWIG has been beefed up only recently. If you have to understand or modify any of the CPAN modules, you have to know XS.</P
><p class="para">Both tools provide significant degrees of freedom to compensate for most deficiencies, so my advice is to pick one and go with it. </P
