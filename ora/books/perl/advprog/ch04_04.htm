>Since closures are subroutine references with a bit of private data thrown in, they are very convenient to use as callback procedures in graphical user interfaces.</P
><p class="para">Let's say you create a button using the Tk toolkit and give it a subroutine reference. When the button is pressed, it calls this subroutine back. Now if the same subroutine is given to two different buttons on the screen, there's a problem: How does the subroutine know which button is calling it? Simple. Instead of giving the button a reference to an ordinary subroutine, you give it a "smart" callback subroutine&nbsp;- a closure. This closure stores away some data specific to a button (such as its name), and when the subroutine is called, it magically has access to that data, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#ch04-42241" title="Passing Closures Instead of Ordinary Subroutines">Example 4.2</A
