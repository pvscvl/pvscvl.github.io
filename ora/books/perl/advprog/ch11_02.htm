>The adaptor interface is undoubtedly simple; in this section, we will ask ourselves whether it is too simplistic. The Adaptor implementation is still at the level of a prototype but, as we shall see in the next few pages, is significant enough to challenge us on all the issues that the people working with object persistence are trying to grapple with. </P

The idea was to write small prototypes without messing around with databases and then migrate to a database for the real thing by simply changing the adaptor. Further, I wanted to retain the flexibility of an object living in multiple persistent stores concurrently, because that is the only way to copy objects from one store to another.</P
><p class="para">I wanted to retain the best features of memory-based data structures (navigability, speed, ease of use) and those of databases (transactions, concurrency, queries), where available.

>One important stricture that we easily forget is that an object is not just data. The three serialization modules we saw in the last chapter&nbsp;- FreezeThaw, Data::Dumper, and Storable&nbsp;- all make this assumption. They look past an object reference at the underlying structure and serialize whatever is reachable from there. This assumes that all instance-specific data is reachable from the reference: a false assumption. For example, an object reference of type ObjectTemplate is merely a reference to a scalar. By studying that reference, you have no idea of the object's attributes. </P
><p class="para">There is a worse problem with the above modules: when restoring objects from a byte stream, they simply recreate the original data structure in memory and bless it under the target module, without the module's involvement. This has the possibility of missing a few key initializations.</P
><p class="para">To avoid these problems, Adaptor requires each class that wants persistence to support three methods: a constructor, <kbd class="command">new()</KBD
><a class="indexterm" name="ch11-idx-989311-0"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="ch11-idx-989311-1"></A

><code class="literal">new()</CODE
>: The module must provide this constructor (a "default constructor," in C++ parlance), capable of creating an object without any input parameters. The simplest default constructor for creating hash-table-based objects looks like this:</P
><pre class="programlisting">    sub new {
       bless {}; # bless a hash-table reference and return it.

>: Given a list of attribute names, this method should return a list of corresponding values. For now, the restriction is that these values must be scalars (a big limitation; we will have more to say about this shortly). Because this method can be coded efficiently, it is preferable to Adaptor calling individual accessor functions. For example, if you use a hash table for your objects, you can implement this method as a hash slice:</P
><pre class="programlisting">    sub get_attributes {
       my $obj = shift; # @_ now contains names of attributes
       @{$obj}{@_};     # hash slice returns corresponding values

In contrast, some libraries, especially in the C++ world (Microsoft Foundation Classes and the NIH library), require the object to support a streaming interface.

Besides, if we wanted to send these attributes to a file, we know we can always rely on other modules to stream them, without having to ask the object to do it for us.<a class="indexterm" name="ch11-idx-989221-0"></A

The identity cannot be a simple global counter, because when the program restarts, it will get reset to 0, and the adaptor will start handing out numbers that might have been given to persistent objects in an earlier incarnation. Storing the counter's last value in a file is slow because you have to make sure you flush this value to the file every single time you store an object. (You never know when the program might crash.) The current implementation experiments with an alternate approach. When the program starts, it notes down the time (using <kbd class="command">time</KBD
>, which returns the seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970), and appends to it a five-digit counter; the combined number can be used as an object identifier. When the counter overflows, the time is again noted. If the program crashes and comes back again, the identifier is unique, unless it crashes and comes back up within one second. The trouble with this scheme is that it generates long identifiers (eight bytes, using <kbd class="command">pack()</KBD
>). It also does not work in a distributed setup, because there is the real possibility that two programs call <kbd class="command">time()</KBD
> within the same second, thus generating the same identifier. To avoid this, you have to create an even bigger identifier that incorporates the IP address of the machine.<a class="indexterm" name="ch11-idx-989238-0"></A

Further, we must ensure that when the department data is read from disk, it doesn't create a fresh new object, because one with the same identity already exists in memory.

The problem with this scheme is that if this cache is in script space, it increments the reference count of all its constituent objects, which means that once an object is in this cache, it will never be freed, even if no one else is interested in it.
