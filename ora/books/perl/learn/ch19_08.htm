><p class="para">From the standpoint of the designer of object modules, an object is a reference to a user-defined data structure, often an anonymous hash. Inside this structure is stored all manner of interesting information. But the well-behaved user of an object is expected to get at this information (to inspect or change it), not by treating the object as a reference and going straight for the data it points to, but by employing only the available object and class methods. Changing the object's data by other means amounts to hanky-panky that is bound to get you talked about. To learn what those methods are and how they work, just read the object module's documentation, usually included as embedded pods. <a class="indexterm" name="ch19-idx-4386-0"></A

>The CGI module is unusual in that it can be treated either as a traditional module with exported functions or as an object module. Some kinds of programs are more easily written using the object interface to CGI.pm rather than the procedural one. A guestbook program is one of these.

><p class="para">Users can sit there with the guestbook form, continually typing messages and hitting the submit button. This simulates an electronic bulletin-board system, letting them see each others' new messages each time they send off their own. When they do this, they call the same CGI program repeatedly, which means that the previous widget values are automatically retained between invocations. This is particularly convenient when creating multistage forms, such as those used in so-called "shopping cart" applications. <a class="indexterm" name="ch19-idx-4378-0"></A
