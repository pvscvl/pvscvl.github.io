><p class="para">Lenny, on our staff, was having difficulty converting a document coded
for Scribe to our <kbd class="command">troff</KBD
> macro package, because of
font changes.  The problems he encountered are quite interesting,
apart from the task he was trying to do.</P
><p class="para">The Scribe convention for putting text in a bold font is:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">@f1(put this in bold)</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">This font change command can appear in-line and may begin on one line
and end on a subsequent line.  It can also appear more than once on a
line.  Here's a sample file that shows several different occurrences:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">$ <code class="userinput"><b>cat test</B
></CODE
>
I want to see @f1(what will happen) if we put the
font change commands @f1(on a set of lines).  If I understand
things (correctly), the @f1(third) line causes problems. (No?).
Is this really the case, or is it (maybe) just something else?

Let's test having two on a line @f1(here) and @f1(there) as
well as one that begins on one line and ends @f1(somewhere 
on another line).  What if @f1(it is here) on the line?
Another @f1(one).</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">The sample file shows the different contexts in which the font-change
commands appear.  The script must match &quot;@f1(anything)&quot; when it occurs
on a single line or multiple times on the same line or when it extends
across more than one line.</P
><p class="para">The easiest way to make a single match is:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">s/@f1(\(.*\))/\\fB\1\\fR/g</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">The regular expression matches &quot;@f1(.*)&quot; and saves anything inside
parentheses using \( and \).  In the replacement section, the saved
portion of the match is recalled as &quot;\1&quot;.</P
><p class="para">Putting this command in a sed script, we will run it on our sample file.</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">$ <code class="userinput"><b>sed -f sed.len test</B
></CODE
>
I want to see \fBwhat will happen\fR if we put the
font change commands \fBon a set of lines\fR.  If I understand
things (correctly), the \fBthird) line causes problems. (No?\fR.
Is this really the case, or is it (maybe) just something else?

Let's test having two on a line \fBhere) and @f1(there\fR as
well as one that begins on one line and ends @f1(somewhere 
on another line).  What if \fBit is here\fR on the line?
Another \fBone\fR.</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">The substitute command works properly in the first two lines.  It
fails on the third line.  It also fails in the first line of the
second paragraph where there are multiple occurrences on the same
line.</P
><p class="para">Because a regular expression always makes the longest match possible,
&quot;.*&quot; matches all the characters from &quot;@f1(&quot; to the
<em class="emphasis">last</EM
> closing parenthesis on the line.  In other
words, the span indicated by &quot;.*&quot; ends with the last close parenthesis
it finds, not the first.</P
><p class="para">We can fix this problem by modifying the regular expression &quot;.*&quot; to
zero or more occurrences of any character except &quot;)&quot;.</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">[^)]*</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">In a character class, the caret (^) reverses the sense of the
operation so it matches all characters except those specified in the
brackets.  Here's how the revised command looks:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">s/@f1(\([^)]*\))/\\fB\1\\fR/g</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Now we have a command that handles one or more occurrences on a
single line.  </P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">I want to see \fBwhat will happen\fR if we put the
font change commands \fBon a set of lines\fR.  If I understand
things (correctly), the \fBthird\fR line causes problems. (No?).

Another \fBone\fR.</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">This command gets all instances except the one in the second paragraph
that extends over two lines.  Before solving this problem, it is
interesting to look at Lenny's first solution to it and why it fails.
Here's Lenny's first script:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">/@f1(/,/)/{
	s/@f1(/\\fB/g
	s/)/\\fR/g
}</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">He tried to attack the problem of matching an occurrence over
multiple lines by specifying a range of lines. 
Here's the result of running the script on the test file:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">$ <code class="userinput"><b>sed -f sed.len test.len</B
></CODE
>

on another line\fR.  What if \fBit is here\fR on the line?
Another \fBone\fR.</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Matching lines containing &quot;)&quot; makes unwanted matches on lines
containing only parentheses.
The solution to matching the pattern over more than one line is to
create a multiline pattern space.  If we match &quot;@f1(&quot; and no closing
parenthesis is found, we need to read (<kbd class="command">N</KBD
>) another
line into the buffer and try to make the same kind of match as the
first case (the \n represents the newline).</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">s/@f1(\([^)]*\))/\\fB\1\\fR/g
/@f1(.*/{
	N
	s/@f1(\(.*\n[^)]*\))/\\fB\1\\fR/g
}</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">We can test it out:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">$ <code class="userinput"><b>sed -f sednew test</B
></CODE

></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">As you can see, we have caught all but the next to last font change.  The
<kbd class="command">N</KBD
> command reads a second line into the pattern
space.  The script matches the pattern across two lines and then
outputs <em class="emphasis">both</EM
> lines from the pattern space.  What
about the second line?  It needs a chance to have all the commands in
the script applied to it from top to bottom.  Now, perhaps you
understand why we need to set up a multiline input/output loop like
the one discussed in the previous section.  We add the multiline
Print and multiline Delete to the script.</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen"># Scribe font change script.
s/@f1(\([^)]*\))/\\fB\1\\fR/g
/@f1(.*/{
	N
	s/@f1(\(.*\n[^)]*\))/\\fB\1\\fR/g
	P
	D
}</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">This can be translated as: Once making a substitution across two
lines, print the first line and then delete it from the pattern space.
With the second portion remaining in the pattern space, control passes
to the top of the script where we see if there is an &quot;@f1(&quot; remaining
on the line.</P
><p class="para">The revised script matches all occurrences in the sample file.
However, it's not perfect, so we'll hear from Lenny again.</P
