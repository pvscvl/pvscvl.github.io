>If the advanced scripts in this chapter have one thing in common, it
is that they alter the sequential flow of execution or control.
Normally, a line is read into the pattern space and each command in
the script, one right after the other, is applied to that line.  When
the bottom of the script is reached, the line is output and the
pattern space is cleared.  Then a new line is read into the pattern
space and control passes back to the top of the script.  That is
the normal flow of control in a sed script.</P
><p class="para">The scripts in this chapter interrupt or break the normal flow of
control for various reasons.  They might want to prevent commands in
the script from executing except under certain circumstances, or to
prevent the contents of the pattern space from being cleared out.
Altering the flow of control makes a script much more difficult to
read and understand.  In fact, the scripts may be easier to write than
they are to read.  When you are writing a difficult script, you have
the benefit of testing it to see how and why commands work.</P
><p class="para">We'd recommend that you test the scripts presented in this chapter and
experiment by adding or removing commands to understand how the script
is working.  Seeing the results for yourself will help you understand
the script much better than simply reading about it.</P

>We have emphasized in previous discussions of regular expressions that
pattern matching is line-oriented.  A program like
<kbd class="command">grep</KBD
> attempts to match a pattern on a single line
of input.  This makes it difficult to match a phrase, for instance,
which can start at the end of one line and finish at the beginning of
the next line.  Other patterns might be significant only when repeated
on multiple lines.</P
><p class="para">Sed has the ability to look at more than one line in the pattern
space.  This allows you to match patterns that extend over multiple
lines.  In this section, we will look at commands that create a
multiline pattern space and manipulate its contents.  The three
multiline commands
(<kbd class="command">N</KBD
>,<kbd class="command">D</KBD

correspond to lowercase basic commands

were presented in the previous chapter.  The Delete
(<kbd class="command">D</KBD

of the delete command (<kbd class="command">d</KBD

while <kbd class="command">d</KBD

<kbd class="command">D</KBD

>The multiline Next (<kbd class="command">N</KBD

multiline pattern space by reading a new line of input and appending
it to the contents of the pattern space.  The original contents of

matches the very first character of the pattern space, and not the
character(s) following any embedded newline(s). Similarly, &quot;$&quot; matches
only the final newline in the pattern space, and not any embedded
newline(s).  After the Next command is executed, control is then
passed to subsequent commands in the script.</P
><p class="para">The Next command differs from the next command, which outputs the
contents of the pattern space and then reads a new line of input.  The
next command does not create a multiline pattern space.</P
><p class="para">For our first example, let's suppose that we wanted to change &quot;Owner
and Operator Guide&quot; to &quot;Installation Guide&quot; but we found that it
appears in the file on two lines, splitting between &quot;Operator&quot; and
&quot;Guide.&quot;</P
><p class="para">For instance, here are a few lines of sample text:</P

the next line of input and then makes the replacement.</P

}</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">In this example, we know where the two lines split and where to
specify the embedded newline.  When the script is run on the sample
file, it produces the two lines of output, one of which combines the
first and second lines and is too long to show here.  This happens
because the substitute command matches the embedded newline but does
not replace it.  Unfortunately, you cannot use &quot;\n&quot; to
insert a newline in the replacement string.  You must use
a backslash to escape the newline, as follows:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">s/Owner and Operator\nGuide /Installation Guide\
/</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">This command restores the newline after &quot;Installation Guide&quot;. It is
also necessary to match a space following &quot;Guide&quot; so the new

><p class="para">Remember, you don't have to replace the newline but if you don't it
can make for some long lines.</P

break over multiple lines in different places?  You could modify the
regular expression to look for a space or a newline between words, as
shown below:</P

N
s/Owner *\n*and *\n*Operator *\n*Guide/Installation Guide/
}</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">The asterisk indicates that the space or newline is optional.  This
seems like hard work, though, and indeed there is a more general way.
We have also changed the address to match &quot;Owner,&quot; the first word in
the pattern instead of the last.  We can read the newline into the
pattern space and then use a substitute command to remove the embedded
newline, wherever it is.</P

line by itself.  (See the discussion after the example about why this
is necessary.)  If we match the string &quot;Owner,&quot; we read the next line
into the pattern space, and replace the embedded newline with a space.
Then we attempt to match the whole pattern and make the replacement
followed by a newline.  This script will match &quot;Owner and Operator
Guide&quot; regardless of how it is broken across two lines.  Here's our
expanded test file:</P

commands that match the pattern.  The first one matches it when the
pattern is found already on one line and the second matches the

the first command is necessary is perhaps best demonstrated by
removing that command from the script and running it on the sample

><p class="para">Do you see the two problems?  The most obvious problem is that the
last line did not print.  The last line matches &quot;Owner&quot; and when
<kbd class="command">N</KBD
> is executed, there is not another input line to
read, so sed quits (immediately, without even outputting the line).  To
fix this, the Next command should be used as follows to be safe:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">$!N</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">It excludes the last line ($) from the Next command.  As it is in our
script, by matching &quot;Owner and Operator Guide&quot; on the last line, we
avoid matching &quot;Owner&quot; and applying the <kbd class="command">N</KBD
> command.
However, if the word &quot;Owner&quot; appeared on the last line we'd have the
same problem unless we use the &quot;$!N&quot; syntax.</P
><p class="para">The second problem is a little less conspicuous.  It has to do with
the occurrence of &quot;Owner and Operator Guide&quot; in the second paragraph.
In the input file, it is found on a line by itself:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">Look in the Owner and Operator Guide shipped with your system.</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">In the output shown above, the blank line following &quot;shipped with your
system.&quot; is missing.  The reason for this is that this line matches
&quot;Owner&quot; and the next line, a blank line, is appended to the pattern
space.  The substitute command removes the embedded newline and the
blank line has in effect vanished.  (If the line were not blank, the
newline would still be removed but the text would appear on the same
line with &quot;shipped with your system.&quot;)  The best solution seems to be
to avoid reading the next line when the pattern can be matched on one
line.  So, that is why the first instruction attempts to match the
case where the string appears all on one line.</P

when we encounter two blank lines, the Delete command removes only the

line is not blank, then both lines are output, thus ensuring that a
single blank line will be output.  In other words, when there are two
blank lines in the pattern space, only the first one is deleted.  When
there is a blank line followed by text, the pattern space is output
normally.</P

>The multiline Print command differs slightly from its lowercase
cousin.  This command outputs the first portion of a multiline
pattern space, up to the first embedded newline.  After the last
command in a script is executed, the contents of the pattern space are
automatically output.  (The <i class="option">-n</I
> option or
<kbd class="command">#n</KBD
> suppresses this default action.)  Therefore, print
commands (<kbd class="command">P</KBD
> or <kbd class="command">p</KBD
>) are used when
the default output is suppressed or when flow of control in a script
changes such that the bottom of the script is not reached.  The Print
command frequently appears after the Next command and before the
Delete command.  These three commands can set up an input/output loop
that maintains a two-line pattern space yet outputs only one line at a
time.  The purpose of this loop is to output only the first line in
the pattern space, then return to the top of the script to apply all
commands to what had been the second line in the pattern space.
Without this loop, when the last command in the script was executed,
both lines in the pattern space would be output.  The flow through a
script that sets up an input/output loop using the Next, Print, and
Delete commands is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#SEDAWK-CH-6-FIG-1" title="The Next, Print, and Delete commands used to set up an input/output loop">Figure 6.1</A
>.
A multiline pattern space is created to match &quot;UNIX&quot; at the end of
the first line and &quot;System&quot; at the beginning of the second line.  If
&quot;UNIX System&quot; is found across two lines, we change it to &quot;UNIX
Operating System&quot;.  The loop is set up to return to the top of the
script and look for &quot;UNIX&quot; at the end of the second line.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4180"></A

><img class="graphic" src="figs/sed_0601.gif" webstripperlinkwas="figs/sed_0601.gif" alt="Figure 6.1"><p class="para">The Next command appends a new input line to the current line in the
pattern space.  After the substitute command is applied to the
multiline pattern space, the first part of the pattern space is
output by the Print command and then removed by the Delete command.
That means the current line is output and the new line becomes the
current line.  The Delete command prevents the script from reaching
bottom, which would output both lines and clear the contents of the
pattern space.  The Delete command lets us preserve the second portion
of the pattern space and pass control to the top of the script where
all the editing commands can now be applied to that line.  One of
those commands is the Next command which reads another new line into
the pattern space.</P
><p class="para">The following script implements the same loop:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">/UNIX$/{
        N
        /\nSystem/{
        s// Operating &amp;/
        P
        D
        }
}</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">The substitute command matches &quot;\nSystem&quot; and replaces it with
&quot;Operating \nSystem.&quot;  It is important that the newline be
maintained, or else there will be only a single line in the pattern
space.  Note the order of the Print and Delete commands.  Here's our
test file:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">Here are examples of the UNIX
System.  Where UNIX
System appears, it should be the UNIX
Operating System.</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Running the script on the test file produces:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">$ <code class="userinput"><b>sed -f sed.Print test.Print</B
></CODE
>
Here are examples of the UNIX Operating
System.  Where UNIX Operating
System appears, it should be the UNIX
Operating System.</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">The input/output loop lets us match the occurrence of UNIX at the end
of the second line.  It would be missed if the two-line pattern space
was output normally.</P
><p class="para">If the relationship between the <kbd class="command">P</KBD
> and
<kbd class="command">D</KBD
> commands remains unclear to you, we'll have
another go at it in the next example.  You can also experiment by
removing either command from the above script, or try using their
lowercase cousins.</P
