>In 1985, the authors of awk extended the language, adding many useful
features.  Unfortunately, this new version remained inside AT&amp;T
for several years.  It became part of UNIX System V as of Release 3.1.
It can be found under the name of nawk, for new awk; the older version
still exists under its original name.  This is still the case on
System V Release 4 systems.</P
><p class="para">On commercial UNIX systems, such as those from Hewlett-Packard, Sun,
IBM, Digital, and others, the naming situation is more complicated.
All of these
systems have some version of both old and new awk, but what each

of that book will find some parts duplicated in this book, but in general a
different approach has been taken here.  Whereas in the textbook we
treat sed and awk separately, expecting only advanced users to
tackle awk, here we try to present both programs in relation to one
another.  They are different tools that can be used individually or
together to provide interesting opportunities for text processing.</P
