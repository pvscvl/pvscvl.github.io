><p class="para">We find that when we begin to tackle a problem using sed, we do best if we
make a mental list of all the things we want to do.  When we begin
coding, we write a script containing a single command that does one
thing. We test that it works, then we add another command, repeating
this cycle until we've done all that's obvious to do. (&quot;All that's
obvious&quot; because the list is not always complete, and the cycle of
implement-and-test often adds other items to the list.)</P
><p class="para">It may seem to be a rather tedious process to work this way and indeed
there are a number of scripts where it's fine to take a crack at
writing the whole script in one pass and then begin testing it.
However, the one-step-at-a-time technique is highly recommended for beginners
because you isolate each command and get to easily see what is working
and what is not.  When you try to do several commands at once, you
might find that when problems arise you end up recreating the
recommended process in reverse; that is, removing commands one by one
until you locate the problem.</P

Horsefeathers Software bulletin:</P

><p class="para">The first edit requires that we match blank lines.  However, in
looking at the input file, it wasn't obvious whether the blank lines
had leading spaces or not.  As it turns out, they do not, so blank
lines can be matched using the pattern &quot;^$&quot;.  (If there were spaces on
the line, the pattern could be written &quot;^<img src="../chars/squ.gif" webstripperlinkwas="../chars/squ.gif" alt=" ">*$&quot;.)  Thus, the first

helpful to cut out a portion of a file to use for testing.  It works
best if the portion is small enough to fit on the screen yet is large
enough to include different examples of what you want to change.

second level of testing occurs when you apply them to the complete,

unwanted matches.  For this script, we'll choose the third expression:</P

affects one line, we'll omit showing the results and move on.  The
next edit needs to remove the spaces that pad the beginning of a line.

although the script was written to process a specific file, each of

may well write other scripts that delete blank lines or check for two

other situations reduces the time it takes to develop and test new

commands that change one word or phrase to another.  Of course, such
scripts don't need to be interesting as long as they are useful and
save doing the work manually.</P
><p class="para">The example we look at in this section is a conversion script,
designed to modify various &quot;machine-specific&quot; terms in a UNIX
documentation set.  One person went through the documentation set and
made a list of things that needed to be changed.  Another person
worked from the list to create the following list of substitutions.</P

but in sed's ability to apply this script to the hundreds of files
comprising the documentation set.  Once this script is tested, it can
be executed using <kbd class="command">runsed</KBD
> to process as many files
as there are at once.</P
><p class="para">Such a script can be a tremendous time-saver, but it can also be an
opportunity to make big-time mistakes.  What sometimes happens is that
a person writes the script, tests it on one or two out of the hundreds
of files and concludes from that test that the script works fine.
While it may not be practical to test each file, it is important that
the test files you do choose be both representative and exceptional.
Remember that text is extremely variable and you cannot typically
trust that what is true for a particular occurrence is true for all
occurrences.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2948"></A
>Using <kbd class="command">grep</KBD
> to examine large amounts of input can be
very helpful.  For instance, if you wanted to determine how &quot;core
system diskettes&quot; appears in the documents, you could
<kbd class="command">grep</KBD
> for it everywhere and pore over the listing.
To be thorough, you should also <kbd class="command">grep</KBD
> for &quot;core,&quot;
&quot;core system,&quot; &quot;system diskettes,&quot; and &quot;diskettes&quot; to look for
occurrences split over multiple lines.  (You could also use the
<kbd class="command">phrase</KBD

of multiple words over consecutive lines.)  Examining the input is the
best way to know what your script must do.</P
><p class="para">In some ways, writing a script is like devising a hypothesis, given a
certain set of facts.  You try to prove the validity of the hypothesis
by increasing the amount of data that you test it against.  If you are
going to be running a script on multiple files, use
<kbd class="command">testsed</KBD
> to run the script on several dozen files
after you've tested it on a smaller sample.  Then compare the
temporary files to the originals to see if your assumptions were
correct.  The script might be off slightly and you can revise it.  The
more time you spend testing, which is actually rather interesting
work, the less chance you will spend your time unraveling problems
caused by a botched script.</P

quotation mark by typing two consecutive grave accents, or
