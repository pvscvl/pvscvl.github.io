demonstrate.</P

expression is rather interesting: 1) if the close bracket is the first
character in a character class, it is interpreted literally, not as
the closing delimiter of the class; and 2) of the metacharacters
specified, only the backslash has a special meaning in a character
class and must be escaped.  Also, there is no need to escape the

form paragraphs; each paragraph is separated from the next one by a

><p class="para">Note that the embedded newline is preserved in the pattern space.  The
last command, <kbd class="command">G</KBD

space to the pattern space.  Upon reaching the bottom of the script,
sed outputs the paragraph we had collected in the hold space and coded
in the pattern space.</P

>This script illustrates the mechanics of collecting input and holding
on to it until another pattern is matched.  It's important to pay
attention to flow control in the script.  The first procedure in the
script does not reach bottom because we don't want any output
<em class="emphasis">yet</EM
>.  The second procedure does reach bottom,
clearing the pattern space and the hold space before we begin
collecting lines for the next paragraph.</P
><p class="para">This script also illustrates how to use addressing to set up exclusive
addresses, in which a line must match one or the other address.  You
can also set up addresses to handle various exceptions in the input
and thereby improve the reliability of a script.  For instance, in the
previous script, what happens if the last line in the input file is
<em class="emphasis">not</EM
> blank?  All the lines collected since the
last blank line will not be output.  There are several ways to handle
this, but a rather clever one is to manufacture a blank line that the
blank-line procedure will match later in the script.  In other words,
if the last line contains a line of text, we will copy the text to the
hold space and clear the contents of the pattern space with the
substitute command.  We make the current line blank so that it matches
the procedure that outputs what has been collected in the hold space.
Here's the procedure:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">${
/^$/!{
     H
     s/.*//
     }
}</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">This procedure must be placed in the script
<em class="emphasis">before</EM
> the two procedures shown earlier.  The
addressing symbol &quot;$&quot; matches only the last line in the file.  Inside
this procedure, we test for lines that are not blank.  If the line
is blank, we don't have to do anything with it.  If the current line is
not blank, then we append it to the hold space.  This is what we do in
the other procedure that matches a non-blank line.  Then we use the
substitute command to create a blank line in the pattern space.</P
><p class="para">Upon exiting this procedure, there is a blank line in the pattern
space.  It matches the subsequent procedure for blank lines that adds
the HTML paragraph codes and outputs the paragraph.</P
