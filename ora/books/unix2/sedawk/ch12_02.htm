indexing program are traced back to a copy of an
indexing program written in awk by Steve Talbott.  I learned this
program by taking it apart, and made some changes to it to support
consecutive page numbering in addition to section-page numbering.
That was the program I described in <cite class="citetitle">UNIX Text
Processing</CITE
>.  Knowing that program, I wrote an indexing
program that could deal with index entries produced by Microsoft Word
and generate an index using section-page numbering.  Later, we needed
a master index for several books in our X Window System Series.  I
took it as an opportunity to rethink our indexing program, and rewrite
it using nawk, so that it supports both single-book and multiple-book
indices.  <cite class="citetitle">The AWK Programming Language</CITE
> contains
an example of an index program that is smaller than the one shown
here and might be a place to start if you find this one too
complicated.  It does not, however, deal with keys.  That indexing
program is a simplified version of the one described in Bell Labs
Computing Science Technical Report 128, <cite class="citetitle">Tools for Printing
Indexes</CITE

The shell script <kbd class="command">masterindex</KBD

allows the user to specify a number of different command-line options
to specify what kind of index to make and it invokes the necessary awk
programs to do the job.  The operations of the

><p class="para">This script consists of a number of pattern-matching rules to
recognize different types of input.  Note that an entry could match
more than one rule unless the action associated with a rule calls the
<kbd class="command">next</KBD

><p class="para">As we describe this script, we will be referring to the rules by
number.  Rule 1 rotates entries containing a tilde and produces two
output records.  The <kbd class="command">split()</KBD
> function
creates an array named <kbd class="command">subfield</KBD
> that contains the
two parts of the compound entry.  The two parts are printed in their
original order and are then swapped to create a second output record in
which the secondary key becomes a primary key.</P
><p class="para">Because we are using the tilde as a special character, we must provide
some way of actually entering a tilde.  We have implemented the
convention that two consecutive tildes are translated into a single
tilde.  Rule 2 deals with that case, but notice that the pattern for
rule 1 makes sure that the first tilde it matches is not followed by
another tilde.[4] </P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[4] In the first edition, Dale wrote, &quot;For extra credit, please send me
mail if you can figure out why the commented regular expression just
before rule 1 does not do the job.  I used the compound expression as
a last resort.&quot;  I'm ashamed to admit that this stumped me also.  When
Henry Spencer turned on the light, it was blinding: &quot;The reason why
the commented regexp doesn't work is that it doesn't do what the
author thought. :-) It looks for tilde followed by a non-tilde
character... but the second tilde of a ~~ combination is
usually followed by a non-tilde!  Using /[^~]~[^~]/ would probably
work.&quot;  I plugged this regular expression in to the program, and it
worked just fine. [A.R.] </P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">The order of rules 1 and 2 in the script is significant.  We can't
replace &quot;~~&quot; with &quot;~&quot; until after the procedure for rotating
the entry.</P
><p class="para">Rule 3 does a job similar to that of rule 2; it allows &quot;::&quot; to be used to
output a literal &quot;:&quot; in the index.  However, since we use the colon as
an input delimiter throughout the input to the program, we cannot
allow it to appear in an entry as finally output until the very end.
Thus, we replace the sequence &quot;::&quot; with the colon's ASCII value in
octal.  (The <kbd class="command">format.idx</KBD
> program will reverse the
replacement.)</P
><p class="para">Beginning with rule 4, we attempt to recognize various ways of coding
entries&nbsp;- giving the user more flexibility.  However, to make
writing the remaining programs easier, we must reduce this variety to
a few basic forms.</P
><p class="para">In the &quot;basic&quot; syntax, the primary and secondary keys are separated by
a colon.  The secondary and tertiary keys are separated by a
semicolon.  Nonetheless the program also recognizes a second colon, in
place of a semicolon, as the delimiter between the secondary and
tertiary keys.  It also recognizes that if no colon is specified as a
delimiter, then a comma can be used as the delimiter between primary
and secondary keys.  (In part, this was done to be compatible with an
earlier program that used the comma as the delimiter.)  The
<kbd class="command">sub()</KBD
> function looks for the first comma on
the line and changes it to a colon.  This rule also tries to
standardize the syntax of &quot;see&quot; and &quot;see also&quot; entries.  For entries
that are colon-delimited, rule 4 removes spaces after the colon.
All of the work is done using the <kbd class="command">sub()</KBD
>
function.</P
><p class="para">Rule 5 deals with &quot;see also&quot; entries.  We prepend the arbitrary string
&quot;~zz&quot; to the &quot;see also&quot; entries so that they will sort at the end of
the list of secondary keys.  The <kbd class="command">pagenums.idx</KBD
>
script, later in the pipeline, will remove &quot;~zz&quot; after the entries
have been sorted.</P
><p class="para">Rule 6 matches entries that do not specify a page number.  The only
valid entry without a page number contains a &quot;see&quot; reference.  This
rule outputs &quot;see&quot; entries with &quot;:&quot; at the end to indicate an empty
third field.  All other entries generate an error message via the
<kbd class="command">printerr()</KBD
> function.  This function
notifies the user that a particular entry does not have a page number
and will not be included in the output.  This is one method of
standardizing input&nbsp;- throwing out what you can't interpret
properly.  However, it is critical to notify the user so that he or
she can correct the entry.</P
><p class="para">Rule 7 outputs entries that contain the colon-delimiter.  Its action
uses <kbd class="command">next</KBD
> to avoid reaching rule 8.</P
><p class="para">Finally, rule 8 matches entries that contain only a primary key.  In
other words, there is no delimiter.  We output &quot;::&quot; to indicate an
empty second field.</P

><p class="para">As you can see, we use a number of options with the
<kbd class="command">sort</KBD

<i class="option">-b</I

symbols and special characters are ignored.  <i class="option">-f</I

specifies that lower- and uppercase letters are to be
<em class="emphasis">folded</EM

treated as the same character for purposes of the sort.  The next
argument is perhaps the most important: <i class="option">-t:</I
> tells the
program to use a colon as a field delimiter for sort keys.  The
&quot;<i class="option">+</I
>&quot; options that follow specify the number of fields to
skip from the beginning of the line.  Therefore, to specify the first
field as the primary sort key, we use &quot;+0.&quot;  Similarly, the
&quot;<i class="option">-</I
>&quot; options specify the end of a sort key.  &quot;-1&quot;
specifies that the primary sort key ends at the first field, or the
beginning of the second field.  The second sort field is the secondary
key.  The fourth field (&quot;+3&quot;) if it exists, contains the volume
number.  The last key to sort is the page number; this requires a
numeric sort (if we did not tell <kbd class="command">sort</KBD
> that this key
consists of numbers, then the number 1 would be followed by 10,
instead of 2).  Notice that we sort page numbers after sorting the
volume numbers.  Thus, all the page numbers for Volume I are sorted in
order before the page numbers for Volume II.  Finally, we pipe the
output to <kbd class="command">uniq</KBD
