><p class="para">This book wouldn't exist without Ron Petrusha. As the technical
book buyer at Golden-Lee, a major book distributor, he
discovered us soon after we started publishing Nutshell
Handbooks in the mid-'80s. He was one of our early boosters,
and we owed him one. So when he became an editor at Bantam (whose
computer book publishing operations were later acquired by Random House), we
took him seriously when he started asking if there was anything
we could do together.</P
><p class="para">At first nothing seemed to fit, since by that time we were doing pretty
well as a publisher. We needed to find something that we could do
together that might sell better than something that either company might
do alone. Eventually, Ron suggested that we co-publish a UNIX book for
Bantam's &quot;Power Tools&quot; series. This made sense for both of us. It
gave Bantam access to our UNIX expertise and reputation, and gave us a
chance to learn from Bantam about the mass market bookstore trade, as
well as build on their successful &quot;Power Tools&quot; series.</P
><p class="para">But what would the book contain?
There were two features of Bantam's
original <em class="emphasis">DOS Power Tools</EM
> that we decided to emulate:  its
in-depth treatment of under-documented system features, and its large
collection of freely available scripts and utilities. However, we didn't
want to write yet another book that duplicated the format of many
others on the market, in which chapters on each of the major UNIX tools
follow one another in predictable succession. Our goal was certainly to
provide essential technical information on UNIX utilities, but more
importantly, to show how the utilities can be combined and used to solve
common (and uncommon) problems.</P
><p class="para">Similarly, because we were weary of the multitude of endlessly tutorial
books about UNIX utilities, we wanted to keep the tone brisk and to the
point. The solution I came up with, a kind of &quot;hypertext in print,&quot;
actually owes a lot to Dale Dougherty. Dale has been working for
several years on hypertext and online information delivery, and I was
trying to get him to work with me on this project. So I tried to imagine
the kind of book that he might like to create. (We have a kind of
friendly rivalry, in which we try to leapfrog each other with ideas for
new and better books!)
Dale's involvement never went far
beyond the early brainstorming stage, but the book still bears his indirect
stamp. In some of the first books he wrote for me, he introduced 
the idea that sidebars-asides that illuminate and expand
on the topic under discussion-could be used effectively in
a technical book. Well, Dale, here's a book
that's nothing but sidebars!</P
><p class="para">Dale, Mike Loukides, and I worked out the basic outline for the book
in a week or two of brainstorming and mail exchanges. We thought we
should be able to throw it together pretty quickly by mining many of
our existing books for the tips and tricks buried in them.
Unfortunately, none of us was ever able to find enough time, and the
book looked to be dying a slow death. (Mike was the only one who
got any writing done.)
Steve Talbott rescued the project by
insisting that it was just too good an idea to let go; he recruited
Jerry Peek, who had just joined the company as a writer 
and UNIX consultant/tools developer for our production
department.</P
><p class="para">Production lost the resulting tug of war, and Jerry plunged in. Jerry
has forgotten more UNIX tips and tricks than Mike, Dale, or I ever knew;
he fleshed out our outline and spent a solid year writing and
collecting the bulk of the book. I sat back in amazement and delight
as Jerry made my ideas take shape. Finally, though, Jerry had had
enough. The book was just too big and he'd never signed on to do it
all alone! (It was about 1000 pages at that point, and only half
done.) Jerry, Mike, and I spent a week locked up in our conference room,
refining the outline, writing and cutting articles, and generally
trying to make Jerry feel a little less like Sisyphus.</P
><p class="para">From that point on, Jerry continued to carry the ball, but not quite
alone, with Mike and I playing &quot;tag team,&quot; writing and editing to fill
in gaps. I'm especially grateful to Mike for pitching in, since he
had many other books to edit and this was supposed to be &quot;my&quot; project.
I am continually amazed by the breadth of Mike's knowledge and his
knack for putting important concepts in perspective.</P
><p class="para">Toward the end of the project, Linda Mui finished up another book
she was working on and joined the project, documenting many of the
freely available utilities that we'd planned to include but hadn't
gotten around to writing up.
Linda, you really saved us at the end!</P
><p class="para">Thanks also to all the other authors, who allowed us to use (and
sometimes abuse!) their material. In particular, we're grateful to
Bruce Barnett, who let us use so much of what he's written, even
though we haven't yet published his book, and Chris
Torek, who let us use many of the gems he's posted to 
the Net over the years.
(Chris didn't keep copies of most of these articles; they were saved
and sent in by Usenet readers, including
Dan Duval,
Kurt J. Lidl, and
Jarkko Hietaniemi.)</P
><p class="para">Jonathan Kamens and Tom Christiansen not only contributed articles
but read parts of the book with learned and critical eyes. They
saved us from many a &quot;power goof.&quot;
If we'd been able to give them 
enough time to read the whole thing, we wouldn't have to issue the 
standard disclaimer that any errors that remain are our own.
H. Milton Peek provided technical review and proofreading.
Four sharp-eyed Usenet readers helped with debugging:
Casper Dik of the University of Amsterdam,
Byron Ratzikis of Network Appliance Corporation,
Dave Barr of the Population Research Institute, and
Duncan Sinclair.</P
><p class="para">In addition to all
the acknowledged contributors, there are many unacknowledged
ones-people who have posted questions or answers to the Net over the
years, and who have helped to build the rich texture of the UNIX
culture that we've tried to reflect in this book.
Jerry also singles out one major contributor to his own mastery of
UNIX. He says:  &quot;Daniel Romike of Tektronix, Inc. (who wrote articles
<a class="xref" href="ch09_06.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch09_06.htm" title="String Editing (Colon) Operators ">Section 9.6</A
>
and
<a class="xref" href="ch11_07.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch11_07.htm" title="History Substitutions ">Section 11.7</A
>
in the early 1980s, by the way) led the first UNIX workshop I attended.
He took the time to answer a ton of questions as I taught myself
UNIX in the early 1980s.
I'm sure some of the insights and neat tricks that I thought I've
figured out myself actually came from Dan instead.&quot;</P
><p class="para">James Revell and Bryan Buus scoured &quot;the Net&quot; for useful and interesting free
software that we weren't aware of. Bryan also compiled most of the
software he collected so we could try it out and gradually winnow
down the list.</P
><p class="para">Thanks also to all of the authors of the software packages we wrote
about and included on the disk! Without their efforts, we wouldn't
have had anything to write about; without their generosity in making
their software free in the first place, we wouldn't be able to
distribute hundreds of megabytes of software for the price of a book.</P
><p class="para">Jeff Moskow of Ready-to-Run Software solved the problem we had been
putting off to the end, of packaging up all the software for the
disk, porting it to the major UNIX platforms, and making it easy to
install. This was a much bigger job than we'd anticipated, and we
could never have done it without Jeff and the RTR staff. We might
have been able to distribute source code and binaries for a few
platforms, but without their porting expertise, we could never have
ported all these programs to every supported platform.
Eric Pearce worked with RTR to pre-master the software for CD-ROM
duplication, wrote the installation instructions, and made sure that
everything came together at the end!
(Eric, thanks for pitching in
at the last minute.
You were right that there were a lot of details
that might fall through the cracks.)</P
><p class="para">Edie Freedman worked with us to design the format of the book-quite
an achievement considering everything we wanted the format to do!
She met the challenge of presenting thousands of inline cross references
without distracting the reader or creating a visual monstrosity.
What she created is as attractive as it is useful-a real
breakthrough in technical book design, and one that we plan to use
again and again!  </P
><p class="para">Lenny Muellner was given the frightful task of implementing all of
our ideas in <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
>&nbsp;- no mean feat, and one that added to his
store of grey hair.</P
><p class="para">Eileen Kramer was the copyeditor, proofreader, and critic 
who made sure that everything came together. For a
thousand-plus page book with multiple authors, it's hard to imagine
just how much work that was.</P
><p class="para">Ellie Cutler wrote the index; Chris Reilley created the
illustrations. Additional administrative support was provided by
Bonnie Hyland, Donna Woonteiler, and Jane Appleyard.</P
