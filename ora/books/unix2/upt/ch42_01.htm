>Most ASCII terminals, or <em class="emphasis">tty</EM
>s, are connected to the system by a
<em class="emphasis">serial line</EM
>-a set of up to 24 wires defined by the RS-232 standard.
A
remote terminal may be connected to a modem by a serial line; if this
is the case, the computer too must be connected to a modem, and the
two modems talk to each other over the telephone.
Some serial line
configuration happens at the hardware level.
For example, not every
cable includes every wire called for in the RS-232 standard, and both
the terminal and the system or modem have to agree to such things as which
one will talk over which wire.
(Actually, both computer systems and
terminals are quite stubborn about this; they have fixed ideas about
which wire to talk on, and which to listen on, and if both want to
use the same one, it's up to the system administrator to trick them
by crossing the wires.)</P
><p class="para">There's more to the communications link than just the wires, though.
For example, both the terminal and the system or modem have to be 
configured to agree on such things as how many data bits make up a
character (a byte is made up of eight bits, but ASCII characters only
require seven), whether or not to use parity (a simple form of error
checking), how to &quot;frame&quot; each character with &quot;start&quot; and &quot;stop&quot;
bits, and how fast to communicate (the baud rate).</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-46512"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-46514"></A
>All of these things are usually configured in advance&nbsp;- if they
weren't, the system and terminal couldn't talk to each other.
However, the

does let you change these parameters on the fly (at least on the system 
side&nbsp;- your terminal may have a setup key and a built-in setup menu).
You'd better know what you're doing, though, or you may render your terminal 
and computer unable to communicate.</P

>At least when UNIX started out, there were no standards for how
terminals worked.
A screen size of 24 lines and 80 columns became a
(fairly) common denominator, but the special keys on terminal keyboards 
generate different characters, and each terminal might respond
to different
<span class="link">escape sequences (<a class="linkend" href="ch05_08.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch05_08.htm" title="Terminal Escape Sequences ">5.8</A
>)</SPAN
>
for moving the cursor around the screen, highlighting text in inverse
video, underlining, and so on.
The 
<span class="link"><em class="emphasis">termcap</EM
> and <em class="emphasis">terminfo</EM
> databases (<a class="linkend" href="ch05_02.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch05_02.htm" title="The Idea of a Terminal Database ">5.2</A
>)</SPAN
>
were developed to make sense out of this babel.
Once a terminal's
characteristics are described in the database, a screen-oriented
program like <em class="emphasis">vi</EM
> can look up the information it needs to clear
the screen, move around, and so on.
Programs like
<span class="link"><em class="emphasis">tset</EM
> (<a class="linkend" href="ch05_11.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch05_11.htm" title="Initializing the Terminal with tset ">5.11</A

<span class="link"><em class="emphasis">tput</EM

>, <a class="linkend" href="ch41_10.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch41_10.htm" title="Using terminfo Capabilities in Shell Programs ">41.10</A
>)</SPAN
>
were created to read the terminal database and use the information it
contains to issue commands (in the form of escape sequences) to the terminal.
If you always use the same kind of terminal, you can 
configure your terminal by
<span class="link">issuing the escape sequences directly (<a class="linkend" href="ch41_09.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch41_09.htm" title="Commands to Adjust Your Terminal ">41.9</A
>)</SPAN
>.
You don't need to look them up in the terminal database.
(That's only important if you want a program or script to work with a variety
of terminals.)</P

>The serial line driver does various things to the characters it gets
from the terminal.
For example, in normal use, it changes the carriage return
(ASCII character \015) generated by the RETURN key on your keyboard
into a linefeed (ASCII character \012).
Chris Torek talks about
some of these conversions in article
<a class="xref" href="ch41_02.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch41_02.htm" title="stty and All That Stuff ">41.2</A
>.
For the most part, unless you are a programmer or a system
administrator, you don't need to know a whole lot about all of the
possibilities&nbsp;- but you do need to know that they are configurable,
and that 
<span class="link"><em class="emphasis">stty</EM

is the program that reports (and
<span class="link">changes (<a class="linkend" href="ch05_09.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch05_09.htm" title="Setting Your Erase, Kill, and Interrupt Characters ">5.9</A

the settings.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-46548"></A
>Not all of the terminal driver settings are obscure.
Some of them
you use every day, and 
must be sure to set in your

For example, how does the system know that
you want to use CTRL-c to interrupt a program or CTRL-s to stop
output, or CTRL-z to suspend execution?
This happens at a level
below even the shell&nbsp;- the shell never even sees these characters,
because they are interpreted and acted on by the serial line driver.
However, there are times when they <em class="emphasis">aren't</EM
> interpreted.
Have
you ever typed CTRL-z when you're in <em class="emphasis">vi</EM
>'s insert mode?
Instead of
<em class="emphasis">vi</EM
> being suspended, the character is input.
That's because
<em class="emphasis">vi</EM
> needs to
<span class="link">reset the serial driver to a different mode (<a class="linkend" href="ch41_02.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch41_02.htm" title="stty and All That Stuff ">41.2</A

so that it has control over which characters are echoed and which are
interpreted as commands.</P
><p class="para">All of this is by way of saying that there's an awful lot of
complexity under the skin.</P

the shell may intercept and act on various characters before passing
them on to another program.</P

><p class="para">The point of this long excursion is to suggest that when you are
trying to figure out problems with terminals, you owe it to
yourself to know about all the levels where the problems can occur.
(For example, article
<a class="xref" href="ch08_20.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch08_20.htm" title="How Many Backslashes?">8.20</A
>
is about backslash handling.)</P
><p class="para">Are the terminal and computer system properly configured?
Has the cable come loose?
Is the
terminal type set correctly so that programs know how to make that
particular terminal do their bidding?
Has an interrupted program
sent out unfinished commands that left the terminal in an
inconsistent or unusual state?
Is it really a terminal problem, or
is it just that things aren't working quite the way you expect?</P
