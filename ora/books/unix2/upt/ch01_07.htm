>It has been said that UNIX is not an operating
system as much as it is a way of thinking. In
<em class="emphasis">The UNIX Programming Environment</EM
>,
Kernighan and Pike write that at the heart of the
UNIX philosophy &quot;is the idea that the power of a
system comes more from the relationships among
programs than from the programs themselves.&quot;</P
><p class="para">Almost all of the utility programs that run
under UNIX share the same user interface&nbsp;- a
minimal interface to be sure&nbsp;- but one that allows
them to be strung together in pipelines to do jobs
that no single program could do alone.</P
><p class="para">There are many operating systems with features UNIX can't match&nbsp;- better
performance, better documentation, more ease of use.
But none of them are so powerful or so exciting to use once
you get the hang of pipes and filters, and the programming power of the shell.</P
><p class="para">A new user starts by stringing together simple pipelines and, when they get
long enough,
<span class="link">saving them into a file (<a class="linkend" href="ch01_05.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch01_05.htm" title="Anyone Can Program the Shell ">1.5</A
>)</SPAN
>
for later execution.
Gradually, if the user has the right temperament, he gets the idea that
the computer can do more of the boring part of
many jobs.
Perhaps he starts out with a
<span class="link"><em class="emphasis">for</EM
> loop (<a class="linkend" href="ch09_12.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch09_12.htm" title="The Bourne Shell for Loop ">9.12</A
>)</SPAN
>
to
apply the same editing script to a series of files.
Conditions and cases soon follow and before long,
he finds himself programming.</P
><p class="para">On most systems, you need to learn consciously how to program.
You must take up the study of one or more programming languages and
spend a fair amount of concentrated effort before
you can do anything productive.
UNIX, on the other hand, teaches programming imperceptibly&nbsp;- it is a slow but
steady extension of the work you do simply in interacting with the computer.</P
><p class="para">Before long, you can step outside the bounds
of the tools that have already been provided by the
designers of the system, and solve problems that
don't quite fit the mold. This is sometimes called<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1035"></A
>
hacking; in other contexts, it is called &quot;engineering.&quot;
In essence, it is the ability to build a tool when
the right one is not already on hand.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1038"></A
>Dale Dougherty compares UNIX to
the Volkswagen beetle, that unique automobile of
the '60s and '70s.
Its simple design was in part what
made it popular; the &quot;bug&quot; was hand-maintainable.
VW owners (users) could tinker with their cars,
performing such tasks as changing spark plugs by
hand.
They scoffed at owners of other cars who
depended upon auto mechanics.
It is perhaps this
same feeling of independence (let me do it myself) that the UNIX
environment fosters in its users.
There are many other, quite capable software
environments that are packaged to keep users out,
like a television set.</P
><p class="para">In some ways, the secret of UNIX is that its
working parts are visible.
The UNIX environment,
like the VW beetle, is designed so that users can
take it apart and put it back together.
UNIX provides general-purpose tools, all of which are
designed to work together.</P
><p class="para">No single program, however well thought out,
will solve every problem.
There is always a special
case, a special need, a situation that runs counter to
the expected.
But UNIX is not a single program. It
is a collection of hundreds of them, and with these basic
tools, a clever or dedicated person can
meet just about any computing problem.</P
><p class="para">Like the fruits of any advanced system, these
capabilities don't fall unbidden into the hands of
new users.
But they are there for the reaching. And
over time, even those users who want a system they
don't have to think about will gradually reach out
for these capabilities.
Faced with a choice between
an hour spent on a boring, repetitive task and an
hour putting together a tool that will do the task in
a flash, most of us will choose the latter.</P
