with some desired combination of the two versions.</P
><p class="para">It might take you a moment to think of a case in which you might have
use for this feature.
Consider this one: two people have unknowingly made edits to
different copies of a file, and you need the two versions merged.
(This can happen especially easily in a networked environment, in
which people copy files between machines.
Poor coordination can easily result in this kind of problem.)</P
><p class="para">To make this situation concrete, let's take a look at two versions of
the same paragraph, that we want to combine:</P

College Library in Dublin, was found in the ancient
monastery at Ceannanus Mor, now called Kells. It is a
beautifully illustrated manuscript of the Latin Gospels,

It was written in the eighth century. 
The manuscript is generally regarded as the finest example
of Celtic illumination.

We can merge them into one file that incorporates both

><p class="para">You'll notice that the script appears in reverse order, with the
changes later in the file appearing first.
This is essential whenever you're making changes based on line
numbers;  otherwise, changes made earlier in the file may change the
numbering, rendering the later parts of the script ineffective.
You'll also notice that, as mentioned, this script will simply
recreate <em class="emphasis">version2</EM

We want the change to line 5, but not the change to lines 1 and 2.

We want to edit the script so that it looks like this:</P

><p class="para">Using <em class="emphasis">diff</EM
> like this can get confusing, especially when there
are many changes.
It is easy to get the direction of changes confused 
or to make the wrong edits.
Just remember to do the following:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Specify the file that is closest in content to your eventual target as
the first file on the <em class="emphasis">diff</EM
> command line.
This will minimize the size of the editing script that is produced.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">After you have corrected the editing script so that it makes only the
changes that you want, apply it to that same file (the first file).</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">Nonetheless, because there is so much room for error, it is better not
to have your script write the changes back directly into one of your
source files.
Instead of adding a <code class="literal">w</CODE
> command at the end of the script, add
the command <code class="literal">%p</CODE
> (or <code class="literal">1,$p</CODE
>) to write the results to 
<span class="link">standard output (<a class="linkend" href="ch13_01.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch13_01.htm#UPT-ART-1023" title="Using Standard Input and Output">13.1</A
>)</SPAN
>.
This is almost always preferable when you are using a complex editing
script.</P
><p class="para">&#13;If we use this command in the editing script, the command line to
actually make the edits would look like this:</P
><p class="para"><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">$ <code class="userinput"><b>ex - version1 &lt; exscript &gt; version3</B
></CODE
></PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
></P
><p class="para">Writers often find themselves making extensive changes and then
wishing they could go back and recover some part of an earlier
version.
Obviously, frequent backups will help.
However, if backup storage space is at a premium, it is possible
to save only some older version of a file
and then keep incremental <em class="emphasis">diff</EM
> <em class="emphasis">-e</EM
> scripts to mark the
differences between each successive version.
(As it turns out, this is what version control systems like
<span class="link">SCCS and RCS (<a class="linkend" href="ch20_12.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch20_12.htm" title="Protecting Files with SCCS or RCS ">20.12</A

do.)</P
><p class="para">To apply multiple scripts to a single file, you can simply pipe them
to <em class="emphasis">ex</EM

><p class="para">But wait!
How do you get your <code class="literal">w</CODE
> (or <code class="literal">%p</CODE
>) command into the
pipeline?
You could edit the last script to include one of these commands.
But there's another trick that we ought to look at because it
illustrates another useful feature of the shell that many people are
unaware of.
If you enclose a semicolon-separated list of commands in
<span class="link">parentheses (<a class="linkend" href="ch13_07.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch13_07.htm" title="The () Subshell Operators ">13.7</A

the standard output of all of the commands are combined, and can be
redirected together.
