>In the early '80s, one thing that made UNIX popular was that it came
with its own typesetting system. It was the first operating system
that could really let users produce high-quality documents using 
laser printers. Although there are probably more fancy editors
available for Macintosh systems, high-quality printing is still a part
of the UNIX experience.</P
><p class="para">In this article, we'll discuss briefly the different typesetters that
are available for UNIX. We won't describe any of the systems in
detail, but we'll give enough information so that you'll know what
options are available.</P

>This is the grand-daddy of UNIX typesetters. It's the oldest program
that we'll discuss. It's a batch-oriented, markup-based language.
This means that you insert typesetting commands directly into your
document. You write documents with a regular text editor, like
<em class="emphasis">vi</EM
> or <em class="emphasis">emacs</EM
>, process them with the <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> command
(or, more likely, by invoking some kind of &quot;format&quot; shell script), and
see the output on a laser printer. In fact, <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> files are
really more like &quot;programs&quot; than traditional &quot;text files.&quot;</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-48182"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-48184"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-48186"></A
><em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> comes with three preprocessors that handle equations (<em class="emphasis">eqn</EM
>),
tables (<em class="emphasis">tbl</EM
>), and simple line drawings (<em class="emphasis">pic</EM
>). The
equation and table processors
are reasonably good; the drawing program has some interesting
features, but really isn't worth the trouble. If you need
a lot of illustrations (or high-quality illustrations), use a tool
like FrameMaker or Interleaf, or some dedicated illustration
program, and insert the results into your <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> document.</P
><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> is surprisingly flexible, although taking advantage of its
flexibility is difficult. For example, this book was written with
<em class="emphasis">troff</EM
>; we've added index, cross reference, and table-of-contents
packages (see article
<a class="xref" href="ch43_13.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch43_13.htm" title="The Text Formatters nroff, troff, ditroff, ... ">43.13</A
>).
Although it's obsolete, quirky, and difficult, we
find that <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> is still better for large typesetting jobs,
particularly books.</P
><p class="para">At one time, <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> was supplied with all UNIX systems. That's no
longer true; these days, you often have to buy it as an extra-cost
product, particularly if you're using System V. Unfortunately, if
<em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> comes with your system, it's probably the old and moldy
version that was designed to work with a particular obsolete
phototypesetter. By hacking it to death, it has been made to work
with modern printers of all sorts. But you're better off spending the
money and getting <em class="emphasis">device independent troff</EM
>; you'll get much
better results.</P
><p class="para">Of course, now that
vendors are making money from <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
>, some third party vendors
such as SoftQuad and Elan are selling enhanced versions.
Given the language's basic warts, this is probably a good thing.
The Free Software Foundation also has a version of <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> called
<span class="link"><em class="emphasis">groff</EM

>TeX is a typesetting language that was designed in the '70s by
Donald Knuth, primarily so he could write his <em class="emphasis">Art of Computer
Programming</EM
> books.
I am not a fan of TeX, and readers of this section should be
forewarned. Really, in my opinion, TeX is not much worse than <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
>. But it's also
not much better, despite many claims to the contrary.</P
><p class="para">TeX is a complete programming language. Like <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
>, you add
typesetting commands to your text as you write it, and then process
the document with some kind of formatting command.
TeX's syntax is much more like a programming language than a &quot;simple
markup language.&quot; However, if <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
>'s syntax is graceless,
TeX's is decidedly ugly. If you write a lot of software, you might like it.
If you don't write software, you might get used to it with time.
I don't find LaTeX (a macro package that makes TeX look like Scribe,
which we'll discuss later)
to be a significant improvement, though it's admittedly simpler.
If you want to write your own macro package, the difference between
TeX and <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> is a toss-up; whichever you choose, the task 
requires a lot of black magic.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-48228"></A
>TeX's biggest strength is typesetting equations, for which it really
doesn't have an equal. (<em class="emphasis">troff</EM
>'s <em class="emphasis">eqn</EM
> preprocessor will do
the job, but isn't anywhere near as flexible.) It doesn't have a
drawing processor, though I have seen versions of <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
>'s
<em class="emphasis">pic</EM
> preprocessor that work with TeX. However, if you need
illustrations, you'll need to develop them with some other tools and
insert the results into your TeX document.</P
><p class="para">I think TeX's biggest drawback is its error messages.
<em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> has virtually no error messages. But TeX's error messages
are incomprehensible or misleading, and I think that's worse.
TeX messages typically complain about something going wrong inside 
a macro package. So you get an error message about a line of code
that you've never seen. Yes, your input <em class="emphasis">did</EM
> cause the
error&nbsp;- but, unless you know in detail how TeX works, you may never
figure out why. Another drawback: TeX gives you incredible
flexibility. Unfortunately, you get altogether too much flexibility,
and this gives people who are long on intellect but short on good
taste the ability to create horrendously ugly output. There's no
need for <em class="emphasis">anyone</EM
> to play with the algorithm for putting spaces
between letters or words. In short: it's possible to create
beautiful documents with TeX, but it's very easy to create ugly ones.</P
><p class="para">TeX's biggest advantage is that it's distributed for free by the
American Mathematical Society. So if you need a low-cost typesetting
solution, it's definitely worth considering. [There are also
commercial versions available.
These may be preferable on the
strength of their technical support. <em class="emphasis">-EK</EM
>&nbsp;]
O'Reilly &amp; Associates has a Nutshell Handbook, <em class="emphasis">Making TeX Work</EM
>,
that shows how to combine TeX with other packages to do what you need.</P

>A few words on Scribe, only because I really thought it was a good
tool. Scribe was another &quot;batch&quot; typesetting system, like TeX and
<em class="emphasis">troff</EM

hiding complexity from the mortal user. Someone with no technical

></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-48263"></A
>In the last decade, we've been bombarded with WYSIWYG documentation
tools. WYSIWYG stands for &quot;What You See Is What You Get,&quot; and means
that your workstation or
<span class="link">X terminal (<a class="linkend" href="ch01_31.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch01_31.htm" title="The X Window System ">1.31</A
>)</SPAN
>
displays a realistic approximation
of the printed document on the screen. When you make changes, you get
immediate feedback on what happened; you don't have to wait for the
document to come out of the printer. Such tools are very good for
drawings and illustrations. They aren't quite as good at handling
equations, but some of them have special equation processors built-in.
The drawback of the WYSIWYG
is (of course) that you can't use a WYSIWYG processor effectively on
an ASCII terminal.</P
><p class="para">We've tried several of the major WYSIWYG packages for UNIX,
and we use a couple of them at O'Reilly &amp; Associates.
In terms of features, they tend to leap-frog one another. In my
opinion, a lot of these features (like self-modifying, or &quot;live,&quot;
documents) exist mostly for marketing value. They're surprisingly
weak at handling large (book-length) documents; yes, they can do it,
but the battle-scarred batch tools (Scribe, TeX, and <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
>) do
as good a job, or better.</P
><p class="para">The WYSIWYG packages are arguably easier to learn than the
batch-oriented typesetters. However, it's easy to overstate the
advantages of a graphical interface. While they're certainly easier
to learn than <em class="emphasis">troff</EM
> or TeX, I'm not sure how either would stack up
against a well-designed batch document processor, like Scribe.</P
><p class="para">WYSIWYG processors are all added-cost products; they can be quite
expensive. I'm not aware of any public domain or &quot;free&quot; tools, though
such may exist.</P
