>Under UNIX, you use the <em class="emphasis">rm</EM
> command to delete files. The command
itself is simple enough; you just type <code class="literal">rm</CODE
> followed by a list of
files. If anything, <em class="emphasis">rm</EM
> is too simple. It's easy to delete more
than you want, and once something is gone, it's permanently gone.
There are a few hacks that make <em class="emphasis">rm</EM
> somewhat safer, and we'll get
to those momentarily. But first, a lecture on some of the dangers.</P
><p class="para">To understand why it's impossible to reclaim deleted files, you need
to know a bit about how the UNIX filesystem works.
The system contains a &quot;free list,&quot; which is a list of disk blocks
that aren't used.
When you delete a file, its directory entry (which
gives it its name) is removed.
If there are no more
<span class="link">links (<a class="linkend" href="ch18_03.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch18_03.htm" title="Files with Two or More Names">18.3</A
>)</SPAN
>
to the file
(i.e., if the file only had one name), its
<span class="link">inode (<a class="linkend" href="ch01_22.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch01_22.htm" title="How UNIX Keeps Track of Files: Inodes ">1.22</A
>)</SPAN
>
is added to the list
of free inodes, and its datablocks are added to the free list.</P
><p class="para">Well, why can't you get the file back from the free list? After all,
there are DOS utilities that can reclaim deleted files by doing
something similar. Remember, though, UNIX is a multi-tasking
operating system. Even if you think your system is a single-user
system, there are a lot of things going on &quot;behind your back&quot;:
daemons are writing to log files, handling network connections,
processing electronic mail, and so on. You could theoretically
reclaim a file if you could &quot;freeze&quot; the filesystem the instant your
file was deleted&nbsp;- but that's not possible. With UNIX, everything is
always active. By the time you realize you made a mistake, your
file's data blocks may well have been re-used for something else.</P

>When you're deleting files, it's particularly important to use
wildcards carefully. Simple typing errors can have disastrous
consequences. Let's say you want to delete all your
object (<em class="emphasis">.o</EM
>) files. But because of a nervous twitch, you add an
extra space and type:</P
><p class="para"><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">% <code class="userinput"><b>rm * .o</B
></CODE
></PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
></P
><p class="para">It looks right, and you might not even notice the error. But before
you know it, all the files in the current directory will be gone.
Irretrievably.</P
><p class="para">If you don't think this can happen to you, here's something that
actually did happen to me. At one point, when I was a relatively new
UNIX user, I was working on my
company's business plan. The executives thought that, to be &quot;secure,&quot;
they'd set a business plan's permissions so you had to be
<span class="link"><em class="emphasis">root</EM
> (<a class="linkend" href="ch01_24.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch01_24.htm" title="The Superuser (Root) ">1.24</A
>)</SPAN
>
to
modify it. (A mistake in its own right, but that's another story.) I
was using a terminal I wasn't familiar with, and accidentally managed
to create a bunch of files with four control characters at the
beginning of their name. To get rid of these, I typed (as <em class="emphasis">root</EM
>):</P
><p class="para"><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen"># <code class="userinput"><b>rm ????*</B
></CODE
></PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
></P
><p class="para">This command took a <em class="emphasis">long</EM
> time to execute. When about two-thirds
of the directory was gone, I realized (with horror) what was
happening: I was deleting all files with four or more characters in
the filename.</P
><p class="para">The story got worse. They hadn't made a backup in about five
months. (By the way, this article should give you plenty of reasons
for making regular
<span class="link">backups (<a class="linkend" href="ch20_02.htm" webstripperlinkwas="ch20_02.htm" title="Make Your Own Backups ">20.2</A
>)</SPAN
>.)
By the time I had restored the files I had deleted (a several-hour
process in itself; this was on an ancient version of UNIX with a
horrible <em class="emphasis">backup</EM
> utility) and checked (by hand) all the files
against our printed copy of the business plan, I had resolved to be
<em class="emphasis">very careful</EM
> with my <em class="emphasis">rm</EM
> commands.</P
