></H2
><p class="para">The operations of <em class="emphasis">sed</EM
>'s most difficult commands&nbsp;- hold (<em class="emphasis">h</EM
>
or <em class="emphasis">H</EM
>), get (<em class="emphasis">g</EM
> or <em class="emphasis">G</EM
>), and exchange
(<em class="emphasis">x</EM
>)-can be explained, somewhat fancifully, in terms of an
extremely deliberate medieval scrivener or amanuensis toiling to make
a copy of a manuscript. His work is bound by several spatial
restrictions: the original manuscript is displayed in one room; the
set of instructions for copying the manuscript are stored in a middle
room; and the quill, ink, and folio are set up in yet another
room. The original manuscript as well as the set of instructions are
written in stone and cannot be moved about.  The dutiful scrivener,
being sounder of body than mind, is able to make a copy by going from
room to room, working on only one line at a time.  Entering the room
where the original manuscript is, he removes from his robes a scrap of
paper to take down the first line of the manuscript.  Then he moves to
the room containing the list of editing instructions.  He reads each
instruction to see if it applies to the single line he has scribbled
down.</P
><p class="para">Each instruction, written in special notation, consists of two parts:
a <em class="emphasis">pattern</EM
> and a <em class="emphasis">procedure</EM
>.  The scrivener reads the first
instruction and checks the pattern against his line.  If there is no
match, he doesn't have to worry about the procedure, so he goes to the
next instruction. If he finds a match, then the scrivener follows the
action or actions specified in the procedure.</P
><p class="para">He makes the edit on his piece of paper before trying to match the
pattern in the next instruction.  Remember, the scrivener has to read
through a series of instructions, and he reads all of them, not just
the first instruction that matches the pattern.  Because he makes his
edits as he goes, he is always trying to match the latest version
against the next pattern; he doesn't remember the original line.</P
><p class="para">When he gets to the bottom of the list of instructions, and has made
any edits that were necessary on his piece of paper, he goes into the
next room to copy out the line.  (He doesn't need to be told to print
out the line.) After that is done, he returns to the first room and
takes down the next line on a new scrap of paper.  When he goes to the
second room, once again he reads every instruction from first to last
before leaving.</P
><p class="para">This is what he normally does, that is, unless he is told otherwise.
For instance, before he starts, he can be told <em class="emphasis">not</EM
> to write out
every line (the <em class="emphasis">-n</EM
> option). In this case, he must wait for an
instruction that tells him to print (<em class="emphasis">p</EM
>).  If he does not get
that instruction, he throws away his piece of paper and starts
over. By the way, regardless of whether or not he is told to write out
the line, he always gets to the last instruction on the list.</P
><p class="para">Let's look at other kinds of instructions the scrivener has to
interpret. First of all, an instruction can have zero, one, or two
patterns specified:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If no pattern is specified, then the same procedure is followed for
each line.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If there is only one pattern, he will follow the procedure for any
line matching the pattern.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If a pattern is followed by a <code class="literal">!</CODE
>, then the procedure is
followed for all lines that do <em class="emphasis">not</EM
> match the pattern.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If two patterns are specified, the actions described in the procedure
are performed on the first matching line and all succeeding lines
until a line matches the second pattern.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">The scrivener can work on only one line at a time, so you might wonder
how he handles a range of lines. Each time he goes through the
instructions, he tries to match only the first of two patterns.  Now,
after he has found a line that matches the first pattern, each time
through with a new line he tries to match the second pattern.  He
interprets the second pattern as <code class="replaceable"><i>pattern</I
></CODE
><code class="literal">!</CODE
>,
so that the procedure is followed only if there is no match.  When the second
pattern is matched, he starts looking again for the first pattern.</P
><p class="para">Each procedure contains one or more commands or <em class="emphasis">actions</EM
>.
Remember, if a pattern is specified with a procedure, the pattern must
be matched before the procedure is executed.  We have already shown
many of the usual commands that are similar to other editing commands.
However, there are several highly unusual commands.</P
><p class="para">For instance, the <em class="emphasis">N</EM
> command tells the scrivener to go, right
now, and get another line, adding it to the same piece of paper.  The
scrivener can be instructed to &quot;hold&quot; on to a single piece of scrap
paper.  The <em class="emphasis">h</EM
> command tells him to make a copy of the line on
another piece of paper and put it in his pocket.  The <em class="emphasis">x</EM
> command
tells him to exchange the extra piece of paper in his pocket with the
one in his hand. The <em class="emphasis">g</EM
> command tells him to throw out the paper
in his hand and replace it with the one in his pocket.  The <em class="emphasis">G</EM
>
command tells him to append the line he is holding to the paper in
front of him.  If he encounters a <em class="emphasis">d</EM
> command, he throws out the
scrap of paper and begins again at the top of the list of
instructions.  A <em class="emphasis">D</EM
> command has effect when he has been
instructed to append two lines on his piece of paper.  The <em class="emphasis">D</EM
>
command tells him to delete the first of those lines.</P
><p class="para">If you want the analogy converted back to computers, the first and
last rooms in this medieval manor are standard input and standard
output. Thus, the original file is never changed. The line on the
scrivener's piece of scrap paper is in the <em class="emphasis">pattern space</EM
>; the
line on the piece of paper that he holds in his pocket is in the
<em class="emphasis">hold space</EM
>. The hold space allows you to retain a duplicate of a
line while you change the original in the pattern space.</P
