<h2>Colophon</h2>



<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>




<p>The animal on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Perl for System
Administration</em> is a sea otter. North American sea otters
make their homes along the Pacific coast, near the kelp beds
containing the shellfish that make up the majority of their diet. Sea
otters can be found in great numbers in Alaska, and on beaches as far
south as California.</p>




<p>Sea otters are agile and intelligent mammals, and are known to
make ingenious use of tools. Floating on their backs, they hold a
shellfish such as a mussel or abalone on their bellies, and use a rock
to break the shell.</p>




<p>Intensely social, sea otters gather to float in groups called
rafts. They are excellent swimmers, propelling themselves swiftly
through the water with their flipper-like, webbed back paws. Their
thick fur provides them with efficient insulation in the water. At
times, their existence has been threatened as they have been
mercilessly hunted to near extinction for their fur.</p>




<p>Colleen Gorman was the production editor and copyeditor for
<em class="citetitle">Perl for System Administration</em>. Jane Ellin was
the proofreader. Mary Sheehan and Emily Quill provided quality
control. Molly Shangraw, Maeve O'Meara, Gabe Weiss, Mary Sheehan, and
Darren Kelly provided production support. Nancy Crumpton wrote the
index.</p>




<p>Hanna Dyer designed the cover of this book, based on a series
design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is an original illustration
created by Lorrie LeJeune. Emma Colby produced the cover layout with
QuarkXPress 3.32 using Adobe's ITC Garamond font.</p>




<p>Alicia Cech and David Futato designed the interior layout based
on a series design by Nancy Priest. Mike Sierra and David Futato
implemented the design in FrameMaker 5.5.6. The text and heading fonts
are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book. The illustrations that
appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano and Rhon Porter
using Macromedia FreeHand 8 and Adobe Photoshop 5. This colophon was
written by Colleen Gorman.</p>
