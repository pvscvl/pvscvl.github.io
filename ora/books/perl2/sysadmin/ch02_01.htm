<h2 class="sect1">2.1. Perl to the Rescue</h2>





<p>Laptops fall in slow motion. Or at least that's the way it
looked when the laptop I was using to write this book fell off a
table onto a hardwood floor. The machine was still in one piece and
running when I picked it up. As I checked the laptop to see if
anything was damaged, I noticed it started to run slower and slower.
Not only that, but the laptop began to make sporadic and disturbing
humming-buzzing sounds during disk access. Figuring the software
slowdown was caused by a software problem, I shut the laptop down. It
did not go gently into the night, refusing to shut down cleanly. This
was a bad sign.</p>





<p>Even worse was its reluctance to boot again. It would begin the
Windows NT booting process and then fail with a "file not
found" error. By now it was clear that the fall had caused some
serious physical damage to the hard drive. The heads had probably
skidded over the hard drive platter surface, destroying files and
directory entries in their wake. Now the question was, "Did any
of my files survive? Did the files for <em class="emphasis">this book</em>
survive?"</p>





<p>
<a name="INDEX-46"></a><a name="INDEX-47"></a>I
first tried booting to Linux, the other operating system installed on
the laptop. Linux booted fine, an encouraging sign. The files for
this book, however, resided on the Windows NT NTFS partition that did
not boot. Using Martin von L&amp;#246;wis's Linux NTFS driver,
available at <a href="../../../../../../../www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~loewis/ntfs/">http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~loewis/ntfs/</a>
(now shipping with the Linux 2.2 kernels), I mounted the partition and was greeted
with what <em class="emphasis">looked</em> like all of my files intact.</p>





<p>My attempts to copy these files off that partition would proceed fine
for a while until I reached a certain file. At that point the drive
would make those ominous sounds again and the backup would fail. It
was clear that if I wanted to rescue my data I was going to have to
skip all the damaged files on the disk. The program I was using (
<tt class="command">gnutar</tt>) had the ability to skip a list of files,
but here was the problem: which files? There were over
<em class="emphasis">sixteen thousand</em> files on this filesystem at
time of impact. How was I going to figure out which files were
damaged and which were fine? Clearly running <tt class="command">gnutar
</tt>again and again was not a reasonable strategy. This was a
job for
Perl!<a name="INDEX-48"></a>
</p>





<p>I'll show you the code I used to solve this problem a little
later on in this chapter. For that code to make sense, we'll
first need to place it into context by looking at filesystems in
general and how we operate on them using Perl.</p>
