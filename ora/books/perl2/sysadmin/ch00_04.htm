<!-- SECTION BODY -->
<h2 class="sect1">0.4. Acknowledgments</h2>





<p>Writing a book turned out to be a lot like building one of those
classical arches. It started with two pillars in my life that leaned
towards each other, one technical, and the other personal.</p>





<p>On the technical side, I have the greatest appreciation for Larry
Wall, who not only created Perl but imbued it and the Perl community
with the spirit. I am thankful to the great Perl teachers, Tom
Christiansen and Randal L. Schwartz, who have helped me and countless
others learn all the twisty little passages of the language. Further
up on this pillar are the kerjillions of programmers and hackers who
poured countless hours and energy into the language and then chose to
share their work with me and the rest of the Perl community. Wherever
possible in this book I have tried to give these folks credit, but my
thanks go to all of the named and unnamed folks who enrich the Perl
culture with their efforts.</p>





<p>Moving further up the tech column past the Perl section, we come to
the system administration section. Here we find another vibrant
community that has helped to shape me, this book, and the whole
computing field. The members of Usenix, SAGE, and the people who have
contributed to the LISA conferences over the years deserve our thanks
for cultivating and sharing the best the system administration field
has to offer. In particular I'd like to acknowledge and thank
R&amp;#233;my Evard for being such a great influence on my professional
and personal understanding of this field as a friend, mentor, and
role model. He is one of the system administrators I want to be when
I grow up.</p>





<p>Towards the top of the professional column are those directly
responsible for the creation of this book. I'd first like to
thank my reviewers and other commentators who sacrificed many hours
on the alter of this text (in alphabetical order): Jerry Carter, Toby
Everett, &amp;#198;leen Frisch, Joe Johnston, Tom Limoncelli, John A.
Montgomery, Jr., Chris Nandor, Michael Peppler, Michael Stok, and
Nathan Torkington. Even towards the end of this process, they
continued to teach me the finer points of Perl. I am grateful to Rhon
Porter for his illustrations, to Hanna Dyer and Lorrie LeJeune for
the most amazing cover animal, and to the O'Reilly production
staff listed in the colophon. And finally, I am barely worthy to
thank Linda Mui, my editor, whose incredible skill, finesse, and care
allowed me to birth this book and raise it in a good home.
She's the greatest.</p>





<p>Just as an arch is not built from a single column, so too did this
book arise from another, more personal base. I need to thank all of
the people in my spiritual community, Havurat Shalom in Somerville,
Massachusetts, for their constant support during this whole process.
They have taught me the meaning of community. Thank you,
<em class="emphasis">M' kor HaChayim</em>, for this book and all of
the many blessings in my life.</p>





<p>On a separate spiritual front, I am indebted to the Shona people of
Zimbabwe for their incredible <em class="emphasis">mbira</em> music, the
playing of which kept me sane during the writing process. I am
thankful in particular to the many people who shared this music with
me, some as teachers, some as students learning/playing beside me.
Erica Azim, Stuart Carduner, Tute Chigamba, Wiri Chigonga, Musekiwa
Chingodza, Forward Kwenda, Cosmas Magaya, Naomi Moland, Solomon
Murungu, Paul Novitsky, and Nina Rubin have all had a special role in
this process.</p>





<p>I am grateful to my friends Avner, Ellen, and Phil Shapiro, and Alex
Skovronek for their encouragement. A special thank you goes to Jon
Orwant and Joel Segel, two friends whose sage council and support
gave me the opportunity and courage to wordwrestle. My thanks to the
faculty and staff at the Northeastern University College of Computer
Science. I'm extremely grateful to the folks in the CCS Systems
group, who gave me the space, time, and patience I needed while
dealing with this book. Larry Finkelstein, the Dean of the College of
Computer Science, also deserves special recognition. I have never met
a person outside of the system administration field who better
understands system administrators, their needs, and the field in
general. Dean Finkelstein continues to teach me, especially by
example, what it means to be a true leader.</p>





<p>Let's return to the arch metaphor, because we're almost
at the top. Here we find my extended and immediate family. I'm
thankful to them all. My nuclear family, Myra, Jason, and Steven
Blank, are the folks whose nature and nurture (and love) over the
years allow me to be here today. My thanks to Shimmer and Bendir, my
two late night/early morning companions during many a writing jag.
Thanks also to my TCM pit crew, Kristen Porter and Thom Donovan.</p>





<p>If you're familiar with arches, you've probably noticed
that I left out one key part: the capstone. The capstone is the stone
at the top of the arch that keeps the whole thing together. Cindy
Blank-Edelman was that capstone for me in the writing of this book.
If there is anyone who sacrificed more for this book than I did, it
is she. Without her love, support, care, humor, teaching, and
inspiration, I could not be the same person, never mind write a book.</p>





<p>This book is dedicated to Cindy, love of my life.</p>
