<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>










<p>Perl is a powerful programming language that grew out of the
traditional system administration toolbox. Over the years it has
adapted and expanded to meet the challenges of new operating systems
and new tasks. Until now, however, no book has recognized this deep
history by concentrating solely on using Perl for system
administration.</p>





<p>If you know a little Perl, and you need to perform system
administration tasks, this is the right book for you. Readers with
varying levels of both Perl programming experience and system
administration experience will all find something of use within these
pages.</p>




































<h2 class="sect1">0.1. How This Book Is Structured</h2>





<p>Each chapter in this book addresses a different system administration
domain and ends with a list of the Perl modules used in that chapter
and references to facilitate deeper exploration of the information
presented. The chapters are as follows:</p>





<dl>
<dt>
<b><a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "Introduction"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The introduction describes the material covered by the book in more
detail, how it will serve you, and what you need to get the most from
it. The material in this book is powerful and meant to be used by
powerful people (e.g., Unix superusers and NT/2000 administrators).
The introduction provides some important guidelines to help you write
more secure Perl programs.</p>
</dd>





<dt>
<b><a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "Filesystems"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter is about keeping multiplatform filesystems tidy and
properly used. We start by looking at the salient differences between
the native filesystems for each operating system. We then explore the
process of walking or traversing filesystems from Perl and how that
can be useful. Finally, we look at manipulating disk quotas from
Perl.</p>
</dd>





<dt>
<b><a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "User Accounts"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter discusses how these user accounts manifest themselves on
two different operating systems. The crux of this chapter is a
rudimentary account system written in Perl. In the process of
building this system, we examine the mechanisms necessary for
recording accounts in a simple XML-based database, creating these
accounts, and deleting them.</p>
</dd>





<dt>
<b><a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "User Activity"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "User Activity"</a> explores different process control
mechanisms for all three operating systems. These range from the
simple (e.g., MacOS processes) to the more complex (e.g., WinNT/2000
Windows Management Instrumentation). We put these mechanisms to work
with administration helper scripts. Finally, we look at how to track
file and network operations from Perl.</p>
</dd>





<dt>
<b><a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "TCP/IP Name Services"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name services allow hosts on a TCP/IP network to communicate with
each other amicably. This chapter takes a historical perspective by
starting with host files, moving to Network Information Service, and
finally to the glue of the Internet, Domain Name Service. Each step
of the way we show how Perl can make professional management of these
services easier.</p>
</dd>





<dt>
<b><a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Directory Services"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>As the complexity of the information we deal with increases over
time, so does the importance of the directory services we use to
access this information. System administrators are increasingly being
called upon to not only use these services, but to build tools for
their management. This chapter discusses some of the more popular
directory service frameworks such as LDAP and ADSI, and shows you how
to work with them from Perl.</p>
</dd>





<dt>
<b><a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "SQL Database Administration"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Over time, more uses for relational databases are being found in the
system administration realm. As a result, system administrators need
to become familiar with SQL database administration. This chapter
explains two SQL database frameworks, DBI and ODBC, and provides
examples of them in action.</p>
</dd>





<dt>
<b><a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, "Electronic Mail"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter demonstrates how Perl can make better use of email as a
system administration tool. After discussing the basics of sending
and parsing email via Perl, we look at several interesting
applications, including Unsolicited Commercial Email (a.k.a. spam)
analysis and managing tech support email.</p>
</dd>





<dt>
<b><a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Log Files"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>System administrators are often awash in a sea of log files. Every
machine, operating system, and program can (and often does) log
information. This chapter looks at the logging systems offered by
Unix and NT/2000. We discuss approaches for analyzing all of this
information so it can work for you.</p>
</dd>





<dt>
<b><a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "Security and Network Monitoring"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The final chapter heads right into the maelstrom called
"security." We demonstrate how Perl can make hosts and
networks more secure. In addition, we discuss several network
monitoring techniques, including use of the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP) and network sniffing.</p>
</dd>





<dt>
<b><em class="citetitle">Appendixes</em></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Some of the chapters assume some basic knowledge about a topic that
you may not already have. For those who are new to these topics, this
book includes several mini-tutorials to bring you up to speed
quickly. These include introductions to the Revision Control System
(RCS), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Structured Query
Language (SQL), eXstensible Markup Language (XML), and the Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP).</p>
