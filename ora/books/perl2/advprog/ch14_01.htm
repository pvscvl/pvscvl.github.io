They provide a low-level API to create and manage windows, to report interesting events such as mouse and keyboard events, and to draw graphical elements such as lines, circles, and bitmaps. The problem is that drawing even a simple form takes a considerable amount of code and reading thousands of pages of documentation (literally).</P

Building a GUI is now a simple matter of launching an interactive form designer and dragging and dropping these ready-made components into a layout of your choice. Object-oriented programming has never been easier.</P

CLASS="para"
>It turns out that widgets and scripting languages are a perfect match. Widgets have simple interfaces, and form-based GUIs are not performance-critical. Both of these attributes make GUIs a very fertile ground for scripting. Combine that with the fact that GUIs need the most configurability (because that's the part of the application the user deals with, and for the most part, the GUI <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>is</EM

>Tk was developed expressly to be driven by a scripting language: Tcl.[<A
CLASS="footnote"
HREF="#ch14-pgfId-995086"

>] Indeed, it can be argued that Tk is the chief reason for Tcl's popularity. There are a lot of people who don't like Tcl as a scripting language but love Tk, and have attempted to adapt it to their favorite scripting language&nbsp;- Scheme, Python, Guile, and, of course, Perl. Malcolm Beattie made the initial attempt to provide a Perl layer that internally used the Tcl interpreter to reach the Tk library. </P

CLASS="para"
>Meanwhile, Dr. Ousterhout's team at Sun ported both Tcl and Tk to Microsoft Windows and the Mac, and the Perl/Tk combination has followed suit fairly closely. Other portable GUI options are Tcl/Tk, of course, and Python/Tk (which does not rely on pTk). Microsoft is porting its ActiveX (formerly OLE) and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to the Unix environment, so they might be formidable competition soon. The VB toolkit itself doesn't come anywhere close to Perl and Tk's functionality, but the development environment and third-party support is unbeatable. We live in interesting times!</P
