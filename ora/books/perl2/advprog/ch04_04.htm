>Let's say you create a button using the Tk toolkit and give it a subroutine reference. When the button is pressed, it calls this subroutine back. Now if the same subroutine is given to two different buttons on the screen, there's a problem: How does the subroutine know which button is calling it? Simple. Instead of giving the button a reference to an ordinary subroutine, you give it a "smart" callback subroutine&nbsp;- a closure. This closure stores away some data specific to a button (such as its name), and when the subroutine is called, it magically has access to that data, as shown in <A

>An iterator keeps track of where it currently is in a "stream" of entities and returns the next logical entity every time it is called. It is like a database cursor, which returns the next record from a stream of records (the list of records that match the given query). A stream can be bounded (a set of records from a database) or unbounded (a stream of even numbers).</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Let's take a look at how closures can be used to represent streams and iterators. The first example is a stream of even numbers and an iterator on this stream that returns the next even number whenever it is called. Clearly, we cannot generate all possible even numbers (as in the bounded case), but we can always compute the next even number if we remember the previous number generated. The iterator remembers this crucial piece of information.</P
