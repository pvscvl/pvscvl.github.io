>Considering that databases amount to a multi-billion-dollar industry and that DBI (Database Interface) and associated Perl modules are next only to CGI in CPAN's download statistics, it would not be a stretch to say that persistence is the most important of all technologies. In this chapter, we first study the myriad factors to be considered in making our data persistent; we then play with most of the freely available Perl persistence modules and hold them up against the checklist of factors, to clearly understand their strengths and weaknesses and what they provide and where they expect the developer to step in. In the next chapter, we will use some of these modules to create an object persistence framework to store an object transparently in files and databases.</P

If you have ever packed the wiring for your holiday lights, you know that not only do you have to strive for a tight packing, you have to do it in a way that it can be easily and efficiently unscrambled the next time you need to use it. Further, data items can be typeglobs, can contain pointers to native C data structures, or can be references to other data items (making the structures cyclic or self-referential). In this chapter, we will study three modules that serialize data: FreezeThaw, Data::Dumper, and Storable.</P

>Finally, requirements change, and an application that accounts for some of the factors listed above may have to account for more factors&nbsp;- or worse, a different set of factors. There have been several attempts to provide a layer of uniformity between different solutions; for example, DBI and ODBC are two efforts that specify a consistent API across competing relational database implementations. We will be more ambitious in the next chapter: we will build ourselves a set of modules that hide the API differences between file and database storage. It is a fact that the more transparency you look for, the more of an impact there is on performance.</P
