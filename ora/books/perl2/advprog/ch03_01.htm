>Typeglobs are immensely useful. They allow us to efficiently create aliases of symbols, which is the basis for a very important module called Exporter that is used in a large number of freely available modules. Typeglobs can also be aliased to ordinary references in such a way that you don't have to use the dereferencing syntax; this is not only easier on the eye, it is faster too. At the same time, using typeglobs without understanding how they work can lead to a particularly painful problem called <A

>Perl has a curious feature that is typically not seen in other languages: you can use the same name for both data and nondata types. For example, the scalar <KBD
CLASS="command"
>$spud</KBD
>, the array <KBD
CLASS="command"
>@spud</KBD
>, the hash <KBD
CLASS="command"
>%spud</KBD
>, the subroutine <KBD
CLASS="command"
>&amp;spud</KBD
>, the filehandle <KBD
CLASS="command"
>spud</KBD
>, and the format name <KBD
CLASS="command"
>spud</KBD
> are all simultaneously valid and completely independent of each other. In other words, Perl provides distinct namespaces for each type of entity. I do not have an explanation for why this feature is present. In fact, I consider it a rather dubious facility and recommend that you use a distinct name for each logical entity in your program; you owe it to the poor fellow who's going to maintain your code (which might be you!).</P

>] to map identifier names (the string "spud" without the prefix) to the appropriate values. But you know that a hash table does not tolerate duplicate keys, so you can't really have two entries in the hash table with the same name pointing to two different values. For this reason, Perl interposes a structure called a typeglob between the symbol table entry and the other data types, as shown in <A
CLASS="xref"
HREF="ch03_01.htm"
TITLE="Symbol table and typeglobs"
>Figure 3.1</A
