>The OO folks would like nothing more than commercial-grade persistence (in terms of performance, stability, and scalability) and propose methods to retrofit various persistence stores onto an object model. Some of their prominent efforts include the CORBA Persistence Services specification from the Object Management Group, Sun's PJava (Persistent Java), and the OLE Persistence framework from Microsoft. Meanwhile, the database folks are grafting OO features onto their offerings: RDBMS vendors such as Informix and Oracle have announced object-relational databases (supporting abstract data types, not just plain scalar data), and the various TP monitor products from Tandem, IBM, Tuxedo, and Encina are sporting object-oriented interfaces. There is a tiny object persistence camp, the Object Database Management Group, comprising the OODB vendors, but their presence is quite negligible (commercially).</P

>orthogonal" persistence&nbsp;- the ability to make an application or object persistent without embedding any, or much, persistence-specific code in the object. The idea is very seductive: Design your object model, implement it in memory, and then add persistence on the "side." This way, the objects don't have to be cluttered with the myriad details (and differences) of databases, nor do they have to deal with filesystem errors, data formatting, and other problems.[<A
CLASS="footnote"
HREF="#ch11-pgfId-986615"
>3</A
>] You can think of it this way: if you never embed user-interface-specific code inside an object, why would you do so for persistence?</P

>There have traditionally been two approaches to achieving the transparency mentioned above.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>The first is to take advantage of the systems side of things, such as the hardware, operating system, and compiler. For example, object-oriented databases such as Object Store and the Texas Persistent Store (a public-domain library) use the Unix system's <CODE
CLASS="literal"
>mmap</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="literal"
>mprotect</CODE
> calls to transparently move data from memory to disk and back. Another interesting systems-oriented approach comes from a group at Bell Labs, which has built a library that stores the state of an application by having it simply dump core in a controlled fashion, thus faithfully rendering all memory-based data structures onto disk.[<A
CLASS="footnote"
HREF="#ch11-pgfId-985688"
>4</A
>] They have augmented this facility with recovery and transactions and made this approach almost completely transparent to the application.</P

></DIV
></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
CLASS="para"
>The second approach for achieving transparent or orthogonal persistence is to supply application-level tools and libraries, an approach that is considerably more portable than the systems approach. CASE tools, for example, generate code to automate the task of sending objects to a persistent store (typically a relational database), while libraries such as Microsoft Foundation Classes ask the objects to stream themselves out to a file. In the latter case, the objects have to implement streaming methods. In either case, the code to be written by<EM
CLASS="emphasis"
> hand</EM
> is fairly minimal, so it is still a reasonably transparent approach.</P

>Adaptor, a persistence framework for Perl objects (and written in Perl, of course). This is an application-level approach and doesn't expect the objects to implement persistence-specific methods. Unlike typical CASE tools, it does not generate any code files, because Perl is a dynamic language.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>The primary objective of the Adaptor project was to study orthogonal persistence; this, I thought, could be done by "adapting" objects to specific types of persistent stores, using information completely outside the objects; the implementation described in this chapter depends on configuration files to describe which attributes map to which database columns, and how. </P
><P
CLASS="para"
>A secondary objective of this project was to study how you might code an application differently if you could <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>always</EM
> take queries and transaction atomicity for granted; that is, even if you didn't have a database at all, suppose you could ask some entity, "Give me all employees whose salary exceeds $100,000," and the application would be persistence-ready from the very beginning. I'm of the firm belief that you cannot simply <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>drop</EM
> persistence into an application; the object implementations look very different if they <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>know</EM
> that there is some kind of persistence up ahead (even if they don't quite have any specifics about the type of persistence). This is similar to the case of applications knowing that there may be a graphical user interface in the future and that it may be event-driven; for example, you may not write errors out to <KBD
CLASS="command"
>STDERR</KBD
>, and might make sure that no code gets indefinitely blocked on I/O. (We'll actually discuss these issues in <A
