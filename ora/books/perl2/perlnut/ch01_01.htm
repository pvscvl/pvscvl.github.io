>Computer languages differ not so much in what they
make possible, but in what they make easy.  
Perl is designed to make the easy
jobs easy, without making the hard jobs impossible.
Perl makes it easy to
manipulate numbers, text, files, directories, computers,
networks, and programs.  It also makes it easy to develop, modify, and
debug your own programs portably, on any modern operating
system.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Perl is especially popular with systems programmers and web
developers, but it also appeals to a much broader audience.  
Originally designed for text processing, it has grown 
into a sophisticated, general-purpose
programming language with a rich software development environment
complete with debuggers, profilers, cross-referencers, compilers,
interpreters, libraries, syntax-directed editors, and all the 
rest of the trappings of a &quot;real&quot; programming language.  </P
><P
CLASS="para"
>There are many reasons for Perl's success.  For starters,
Perl is freely available and freely redistributable.  But
that's not enough to explain the Perl phenomenon, since many other
freeware
packages fail to thrive.  Perl is not just free; it's also fun.  People
feel like they can be creative in Perl, because they have freedom of
expression.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Perl is both a very simple language
and a very rich language.  
It's a simple language in that the types and structures 
are simple to use and understand, and it borrows heavily
from other languages you may already be familiar with.
You don't have to know everything there is to know about
Perl before you can write useful programs.  </P
><P
CLASS="para"
>However, Perl is also a rich language, and there is
much to learn about it.  That's the price of making hard things
possible.  Although it will take some time for you to absorb all that
Perl can do, somewhere down the line you will be glad that you 
have access to the extensive
capabilities of Perl.</P

>Perl has the advantage of being easy to learn if you just want to 
write simple scripts&nbsp;- thus its appeal to the ever-impatient
system administrator and the deadline-driven CGI developer.

on those ambitions.  <A

>On top of the Perl language itself, however, are 
the Perl modules.  You can think of modules
as add-ons to the Perl language that allow you to 
streamline tasks by providing a consistent API.  
Perl itself is fun to use, but the modules lend Perl 
even more
flexibility and enormous power.  Furthermore, anyone can
write and distribute a Perl module.  Some modules are deemed
important enough or popular enough to be distributed
with Perl itself, but very few are actually written by
the core Perl developers themselves.

><P
CLASS="para"
>The most popular Perl module is CGI.pm, which
gives a simple interface to developing CGI (common gateway interface)
applications in Perl.  While Perl itself is indispensable for many 
different tasks, its text-manipulation features make it perfect 
for CGI development
on the Web. In fact, 
the resurgence of Perl over the past few years must be
credited to its popularity as a CGI language.

one of the most important functions of any
