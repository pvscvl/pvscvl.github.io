<h2 class="sect1">0.2. What's New in This Edition</h2>

<p>Well, almost everything.</p>

<p>Even where we kept the good bits from the previous edition (and there
were quite a few good bits, we'll admit), we've heavily revised and
reorganized the current edition with several goals in mind.  First, we
wanted to increase the accessibility of the book to people coming from
backgrounds other than computer science.  We've made fewer assumptions
about what the reader will know in advance.  At the same time, we've
kept the exposition lively in the hope that people who are already
familiar with some of the material will not fall asleep reading it.</p>

<p>Second, we wanted to present the very latest developments in Perl
itself.  To that end, we have not been shy about presenting the current
state of the work, even where we feel that it is still experimental.
While the core of Perl has been rock solid for years, the pace of
development for some of the experimental extensions can be quite torrid
at times.  We'll tell you honestly when we think the online
documentation will be more reliable than what we have written here.
Perl is a blue-collar language, so we're not afraid to call a spade a
shovel.</p>

<p>Third, we wanted you to be able to find your way around in the book
more easily, so we've broken this edition up into smaller, more
coherent chapters and reorganized them into meaningful parts.  Here's
how the new edition is laid out:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<b><a href="part1.htm">Part 1, "Overview"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Getting started is always the hardest part.  This part presents the
fundamental ideas of Perl in an informal,
curl-up-in-your-favorite-chair fashion.  Not a full tutorial, it merely
offers a quick jump-start, which may not serve everyone's need.  See <a href="ch00_05.htm#ch00-sect-od">Section 0.5, "Offline Documentation"</a> for books that might
better suit your learning style.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><a href="part2.htm">Part 2, "The Gory Details"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This part consists of an in-depth, no-holds-barred discussion of the
guts of the language at every level of abstraction, from data types,
variables, and regular expressions to subroutines, modules, and
objects.  You'll gain a good sense of how the language works and,
in the process, pick up a few hints on good software design.
(And if you've never used a language with pattern matching, you're in
for a special treat.)</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><a href="part3.htm">Part 3, "Perl as Technology"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>You can do a lot with Perl all by itself, but this part will take
you to a higher level of wizardry.  Here you'll learn how to make Perl
jump through whatever hoops your computer sets up for it,
from dealing with Unicode, interprocess communication, and
multithreading, through compiling, invoking, debugging, and profiling Perl,
on up to writing your own external extensions in C or C++ or
interfaces to any existing API you feel like.  Perl will be quite happy
to talk to any interface on your computer, or for that matter, on any
other computer on the Internet, weather permitting.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><a href="part4.htm">Part 4, "Perl as Culture"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Everyone understands that a culture must have a language, but the Perl
community has always understood that a language must have a
culture.  This part is where we view Perl programming as a human activity,
embedded in the real world of people.  We'll cover how you can improve
the way you deal with both good people and bad people.  We'll also
dispense a great deal of advice on how you can become a better person
yourself and on how to make your programs more useful to other people.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
<b><a href="part5.htm">Part 5, "Reference Material"</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Here we've put together all the chapters in which you might want to
look something up alphabetically, from special variables and
functions to standard modules and pragmas.  The Glossary will be
particularly helpful to those who are unfamiliar with the jargon of
computer science.  For example, if you don't know what the meaning of
"pragma" is, you could look it up right now.  (If you don't know what
the meaning of "is" is, we can't help you with that.)</p>
