>The bastion host should be located on a network that does not carry
confidential traffic, preferably a special network of its own.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2726"></A
>Most Ethernet and token ring interfaces can operate in
&quot;promiscuous mode&quot; In this mode, they are able to capture
<em class="emphasis">all</EM
> packets on the network the interfaces are
connected to, rather than just those packets addressed to the
particular machine the interface is a part of. Other types of network
interfaces, such as <span class="acronym">FDDI</SPAN
>, may not be able to
capture all packets, but depending on the network architecture, they
can usually capture at least some packets not specifically addressed
to them.</P
><p class="para">This capability has a useful purpose: for network analysis, testing,
and debugging, e.g., by programs like <em class="emphasis">etherfind</EM
>
and <em class="emphasis">tcpdump</EM
>.  Unfortunately, it can also be used
by an intruder to snoop on all traffic on a network segment. This
traffic might include Telnet, <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>, or
<em class="emphasis">rlogin</EM
> sessions (from which logins and passwords
can be captured), confidential email, <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
> accesses
of sensitive files, and so on. You need to assume the worst: the
bastion host can be compromised. If it is compromised, you don't want
the bastion host to snoop on this traffic.</P
><p class="para">One way to approach the problem is to not put the bastion host on an
internal network; instead, put it on a perimeter network. As we've
discussed in earlier chapters, a perimeter network is an additional
layer of security between your internal network and the Internet. The
perimeter network is separated from the internal network by a router or
bridge. Internal traffic stays on the internal net and is not visible
on the perimeter net. All the bastion host on a perimeter network can
see are packets that are either to or from itself, or to or from the
Internet. Although this traffic might still be somewhat sensitive, it's
likely to be a lot less sensitive than your typical internal network
traffic, and there are other places (for instance, your Internet service
provider) that can already see much of it. </P
><p class="para">Using a perimeter net with a packet filtering router between it and the
internal network gives you some additional advantages. It further limits
your exposure, if the bastion host is compromised, by reducing the number
of hosts and services the bastion host can access. </P
><p class="para">If you can't put the bastion host on a perimeter network, you might
consider putting it on a network that's not susceptible to
snooping. For example, you might put it on an intelligent 10baseT hub,
an Ethernet switch, or an <span class="acronym">ATM</SPAN
> network. If you do
only this, you need to take additional care to make sure that nothing
trusts the bastion host, because there's no further layer of
protection between it and the internal network. Using such a network
technology for your perimeter network is the best of both worlds: the
bastion host is isolated from internal systems (as with a traditional
perimeter network) but can't snoop on traffic on the perimeter
network.</P
