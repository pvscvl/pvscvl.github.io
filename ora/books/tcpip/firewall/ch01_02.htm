>What's out there to worry about? What types of attacks are you likely
to face on the Internet, and what types of attackers are likely to be
carrying them out? And what about simple accidents or stupidity? In
the sections below, we touch on these topics but we don't go into any
technical detail; later chapters describe different kinds of attacks
in some detail and explain how firewalls can help protect against
them.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S2-4">1.2.1 Types of Attacks</A
></H3
><p class="para">There are many types of attacks on systems, and many ways of
categorizing these attacks. In this section, we break attacks down into
three basic categories: intrusion, denial of service, and information
theft.</P
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-1">1.2.1.1 Intrusion</A
></H4
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-293"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-296"></A
>The most common attacks on your systems are
<em class="emphasis">intrusions</EM
>; with intrusions, people are actually
able to use your computers. Most attackers want to use your
computers as if they were legitimate users. </P
><p class="para">Attackers have dozens of ways to get access. They range from social
engineering attacks (you figure out the name of somebody high up in the
company; you call a system administrator, claiming to be that person and
claiming to need your password changed <em class="emphasis">right now</EM
>,
so that you can get important work done), to simple guesswork (you try
account name and password combinations until one works), to intricate
ways to get in without needing to know an account name and password. </P
><p class="para">As we describe in this book, firewalls help prevent
intrusions in a number of ways. Ideally, they block all ways to
get into a system without knowing an account name and
password. Properly configured, they reduce the number of accounts
accessible from the outside that are therefore vulnerable to guesswork or
social engineering.  Most people configure their firewalls to use
one-time passwords that prevent guessing attacks. Even if you don't
use these passwords, which we describe in <a class="xref" href="ch10_01.htm" title="Authentication and Inbound Services">Chapter 10, <cite class="chapter">Authentication and Inbound
Services</CITE
></A
>, a firewall will give you a controlled place to
log attempts to get into your system, and, in this way, they help
you detect guessing attacks.</P

>A <em class="emphasis">denial of service</EM
> attack is one that's aimed
entirely at preventing you from using your own computers.</P
><p class="para">In late 1994, writers Josh Quittner and Michelle Slatalla were the
target of an &quot;electronic mail bomb.&quot; Apparently in retaliation for an
article on the cracker community they'd published in
<em class="emphasis">Wired</EM
> magazine, someone broke into
<span class="acronym">IBM</SPAN
>, Sprint, and the writers' network provider, and
modified programs so their email and telephone service was
disrupted. A flood of email messages so overwhelmed their network
service that other messages couldn't get through; eventually, their
Internet connection was shut down entirely. Their phone service also
fell victim to the intruders, who reprogrammed the service so that callers
were routed to an out-of state number where they heard an obscene
recording.</P
><p class="para">Although some cases of electronic sabotage involve the actual
destruction or shutting down of equipment or data, more often they
follow the pattern of flooding seen in the Quittner-Slatalla case or
in the case of the Internet worm. An intruder so floods a system or
network&nbsp;- with messages, processes, or network requests&nbsp;- that no real
work can be done. The system or network spends all its time responding
to messages and requests, and can't satisfy any of them.</P
><p class="para">While flooding is the simplest and most common way to carry out a denial
of service attack, a cleverer attacker can also disable services,
reroute them, or replace them. For example, the phone attack in the
Quittner-Slatalla case denied phone service by rerouting their phone
calls elsewhere; it's possible to mount the same kind of attack against
Internet services. </P
><p class="para">It's close to impossible to avoid all denial of service attacks. 
Sometimes it's a &quot;heads, I win; tails, you lose&quot; situation
for attackers. For example, many sites set accounts up to
become unusable after a certain number of failed login attempts.
This prevents attackers from simply trying passwords until they find the
right one. On the other hand, it gives the attackers an easy way to
mount a denial of service attack: they lock any user's account
simply by trying to log in a few times.</P
><p class="para">Most often, the risk of denial of service attacks is unavoidable.
If you accept things from the external
universe&nbsp;- electronic mail, telephone calls, or packages&nbsp;- it's possible
to get flooded. The notorious college prank of ordering a pizza or two
from every pizzeria in town to be delivered to your least favorite
person is a form of denial of service; it's hard to do much else while
arguing with 42 pizza deliverers. In the electronic world, denial of
service is as likely to happen by accident as on purpose (have you
ever had a persistent fax machine try to fax something to your voice
line?). The most important thing is to set up services so that if one
of them is flooded, the rest of your site keeps functioning while you
find and fix the problem.</P
><p class="para">Fortunately, deliberate denial of service attacks are not terribly
popular. They're so easy that they're considered 
&quot;unsporting&quot; by many attackers; they tend to be simple to
trace back and are therefore risky to the attacker; and they don't provide
the attacker with the information or the ability to use your computers
(the payoff for most other attacks). Intentional denial of service
attacks are the work of people who are angry at your site in particular,
and at most sites such people are quite rare. </P
><p class="para">You are far more likely to encounter unintentional denial of service
problems, as we discuss in the section on &quot;Stupidity and
Accidents&quot; later in this chapter.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-330"></A

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-338"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-341"></A
>Some types of attacks allow an attacker to get data without ever having
to directly use your computers. Usually these attacks exploit Internet
services that are intended to give out information, inducing the
services to give out more information than was intended, or to give it
out to the wrong people. Many
Internet services are designed for use on local area networks, and
don't have the type or degree of security that would allow them to be
used safely across the Internet.</P
><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Information theft </EM
>doesn't need to be active or
particularly technical. People who want to find out personal
information could simply call you and ask (perhaps
pretending to be somebody who had a right to know): this is an active
information theft. Or they could tap your telephone: a passive
information theft. Similarly, people who want to gather electronic
information could actively query for it (perhaps pretending to be a
machine or a user with valid access) or could passively tap the
network and wait for it to flow by.</P
><p class="para">Most people who steal information try to get access to
your computers; they're looking for usernames and passwords. Fortunately
for them, and unfortunately for everybody else, that's the easiest kind
of information to get when tapping a network. Username and password
information occurs quite predictably at the beginning of many network
interactions, and such information can be reused in the same
form. </P
><p class="para">How would you proceed if you want to find out how somebody answers her
telephone?  Installing a tap would be an easy and reliable way to get
that information, and a tap at a central point in the telephone system
would yield you the telephone greetings of hundreds or thousands of
people in a short period of time.</P
><p class="para">On the other hand, what if you want to know how somebody spells his last
name, or what the names and ages of his children are? In this case,
a telephone tap is a slow and unreliable way to get that information. A
telephone tap at a central point in the system will probably
yield that information about some people, and it will certainly
yield some secret information you could use in interesting
ways, but the information is going to be buried among the conversations
of hundreds of people setting up lunch dates and chatting about the
weather.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-351"></A

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-360"></A
>Similarly, network taps, which are usually called
<em class="emphasis">sniffers</EM
>, are very effective at finding password
information, but are rarely used to gather other kinds of information.
Getting more specific information about a site requires either extreme
dedication and patience, or the knowledge that the information you
want will reliably pass through a given place at a given time. For
example, if you know that somebody calls his bank to transfer money
between his checking and savings accounts at 2 <span class="acronym">P.M.</SPAN
>
every other Friday, it's worth tapping that phone call to find out the
person's access codes and account numbers. However, it's probably not
worth tapping somebody else's phone, on the off chance that they too
will do such a transfer, because most people don't transfer money over
the phone at all.</P
><p class="para">Network sniffing is much easier than tapping a telephone line.
Traditionally, the connectors used to hook a computer up to a network
are known as <em class="emphasis">network taps</EM
> (that's why the term
<em class="emphasis">tapping</EM
> isn't used for spying on a network), and
the connectors behave like taps too. In most common network
technologies, such as Ethernet and token ring, any computer on a local
area network is capable of seeing all the traffic that passes across
that local area network. Traffic that crosses the Internet may cross any
number of local area networks, any one of which can be a point of
compromise. Network service providers and public-access systems are very
popular targets for intrusions; sniffers placed there can be extremely
successful because so much traffic passes through these networks.</P
><p class="para">There are several types of protection against information theft. A
properly configured firewall will protect you against people who are
trying to get more information than you intended to give.
Once you've decided to give information out across the Internet,
however, it's very difficult to protect against that information
reaching an unintended audience, either through misauthentication
(somebody claiming to be authorized, when they're not) or through
sniffing (somebody simply reading information as it crosses a correctly
authorized channel). Although these risks are outside of the protection
a firewall can give (because they occur once information has
intentionally been allowed to go outside your network), we do discuss
them, and the methods used to reduce them, as appropriate in this book.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-369"></A

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="CH01INTRUDTYPES"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-377"></A
>This section very briefly describes the types of attackers who are out
there on the Internet. There are many ways to categorize these
attackers; we can't really do justice to the many variants of attackers
we've seen over the years, and any quick summary of this kind
necessarily presents a rather stereotyped view. Nevertheless, this
summary may be useful in distinguishing the main categories of
attackers.</P
><p class="para">All attackers share certain characteristics. They don't want to be
caught, so they try to conceal themselves. If they gain
access to your system, they will certainly attempt to preserve that
access, if possible, by building in extra ways to get access (and
they hope you won't notice these access routes even if you find the
attackers themselves). Most of them have some contact with other people
who have the same kinds of interests (&quot;the underground&quot; is
not hard to find), and most will share the information they get from
attacking your system.</P
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-4">1.2.2.1 Joyriders</A
></H4
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-384"></A
><em class="emphasis">Joyriders </EM
>are bored people looking for
amusement. They break in because they think you might have interesting
data, or because it would be amusing to use your computers, or because
they have nothing better to do. They might be out to learn
about the kind of computer you have or about the data you
have. They're curious, but not actively malicious; however, they often
damage the system through ignorance or in trying to cover their tracks.
Joyriders are particularly attracted to well-known sites and uncommon
computers. </P
></DIV
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-5">1.2.2.2 Vandals</A
></H4
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-390"></A
><em class="emphasis">Vandals</EM
> are out to do damage, either because they
get their kicks from destroying things, or because they don't like
you. When one gets to you, you'll know it.</P
><p class="para">Vandals are a big problem if you're somebody that the Internet
underground might think of as The Enemy (for example, the phone company
or the government) or if you tend to annoy people who have computers and
time (for example, you're a university with failing students, or a
computer company with annoyed customers, or you have an aggressively
commercial presence on the Internet). You can also become a target
simply by being large and visible; if you put a big white wall up in 
certain neighborhoods, people will put graffiti on it no matter how they feel
about you. </P
><p class="para">Fortunately, vandals are fairly rare. People don't like them, even
people in the underground who have nothing against breaking into
computers in general. Vandals also tend to inspire people to go to great
lengths to find them and stop them. Unlike more mundane intruders,
vandals have short but splashy careers. Most of them also go for
straightforward destruction, which is unpleasant but is relatively
easily detected and repaired. In most circumstances, deleting your data,
or even ruining your computer equipment, is not the worst thing somebody
could do to you, but it is what vandals do. (Actually, introducing
subtle but significant changes in programs or financial data would be
much harder to detect and fix.)</P
><p class="para">Unfortunately, it's close to impossible to stop a determined vandal;
somebody with a true vendetta against your site is going to get you,
sooner or later. Certain attacks are attractive to vandals but not to other
types of attackers. For example, denial of service attacks are not
attractive to joyriders; while joyriders are around in your system, they
are just as interested as you are in having your computers up, running,
and available to the Internet. </P

></H4
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-399"></A
>Many intruders are engaging in an updated version of an ancient
tradition. They're gaining bragging rights, based on the number and
types of systems they've broken into. </P
><p class="para">Like joyriders and vandals, <em class="emphasis">score keepers</EM
> may
prefer sites of particular interest. Breaking into something well-known,
well-defended, or otherwise especially neat is usually worth more points
to them. However, they'll also attack anything they can get at; they're
going for quantity as well as quality. They don't have to want anything
you've got, or care in the least about the characteristics of your site.
They may or may not do damage on the way through. They'll certainly
gather information and keep it for later use (perhaps using it to barter
with other attackers). They'll probably try to leave themselves ways to
get back in later. And, if at all possible, they'll use your machines as
a platform to attack others. </P
><p class="para">These people are the ones you discover long after they've broken in to
your system. You may find out slowly, because something's odd about your
machine. Or you'll find out when another site or a law enforcement
agency calls up because your system is being used to attack other
places. Or you'll find out when somebody sends you a copy of your own
private data, which they've found on a cracked system on the other side
of the world.</P

>Most people who break into computers do so for the same reason people
climb mountains&nbsp;- because they're there. While these people are not
above theft, they usually steal things that are directly convertible into
money or further access (e.g., credit card, telephone, or network
access information). If they find secrets they think they can sell, they
may try to do so, but that's not their main business. </P
><p class="para">As far as anybody knows, serious computer-based espionage is much rarer,
outside of traditional espionage circles. (That is, if you're a
professional spy, there are probably other professional spies watching
you and your computers). Espionage is much more difficult to detect
than run-of-the-mill break-ins, however. Information theft need not
leave any traces at all, and even intrusions are relatively rarely
detected immediately. Somebody who breaks in, copies data, and leaves
without disturbing anything is quite likely get away with it at most
sites.</P
><p class="para">In practical terms, most organizations can't prevent spies from
succeeding. The precautions that governments take to protect sensitive
information on computers are complex, expensive, and cumbersome;
therefore they are used on only the most critical resources. These
precautions include electromagnetic shielding, careful access controls, and
absolutely no connections to unsecured networks.</P
><p class="para">What can you do to protect against attackers of this kind? You can
ensure that your Internet connection isn't the easiest way for a spy to
gather information. You don't want some kid to break into your computers
and find something that immediately appears to be worth trying to sell
to spies; you don't want your competitors to be trivially able to get to
your data; and you do want to make it expensive and risky to spy on you.
Some people say it's unreasonable to protect data from network access
when somebody could get it easily by coming to your site physically. We
don't agree; physical access is generally more expensive and more
risky for an attacker than network access.</P

>Denial of service incidents, for example, frequently aren't attacks at
all. Apple's corporate electronic mail was rendered nonfunctional for
several days (and their network provider was severely inconvenienced) by
an accident involving a single mail message sent from a buggy mail
server to a large mailing list. The mail resulted in a cascade of
hundreds of thousands of error messages. The only hostile person
involved was the system administrator, who wasn't hostile until
he had to clean up the resulting mess.</P
><p class="para">Similarly, it's not uncommon for companies to destroy their own data, or
release it to the world, by accident. Firewalls aren't designed to deal
with this kind of problem. In fact there is no known way to protect
yourself from either accidents or stupidity. Unfortunately, whether
people are attacking you on purpose, or are simply making mistakes, the
results are quite similar. (Hence the saying, &quot;Never ascribe to
malice that which can adequately be explained by stupidity.&quot;) 
When you protect yourself against evil-doers, you also help protect
yourself against the more common, but equally devastating, unintentional
