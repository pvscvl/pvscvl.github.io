>A <em class="emphasis">dual-homed host architecture </EM
>is built around
the dual-homed host computer, a computer which has at least two
network interfaces. Such a host could act as a router between the
networks these interfaces are attached to; it is capable of routing
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> packets from one network to another. However, to
implement a dual-homed host type of firewalls architecture, you
disable this routing function. Thus, <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> packets
from one network (e.g., the Internet) are not directly routed to the
other network (e.g., the internal, protected network). Systems inside
the firewall can communicate with the dual-homed host, and systems
outside the firewall (on the Internet) can communicate with the
dual-homed host, but these systems can't communicate directly with
each other. <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> traffic between them is completely
blocked.</P
><p class="para">The network architecture for a dual-homed host firewall is pretty
simple: the dual homed host sits between, and is connected to, the
Internet and the internal network. <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-04-FIG-3" title="Dual-homed host architecture">Figure 4.3</A
>
shows this architecture.</P

></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire0403.gif" alt="Figure 4.3"><p class="para">Dual-homed hosts can provide a very high level of control. If you
aren't allowing packets to go between external and internal networks
at all, you can be sure that any packet on the internal network that
has an external source is evidence of some kind of security
problem. In some cases, a dual-homed host will allow you to reject
connections that claim to be for a particular service but that don't
actually contain the right kind of data. (A packet filtering system, on
the other hand, has
difficulty with this level of control.) However, it takes considerable
work to consistently take advantage of the potential advantages of
dual-homed hosts.</P
><p class="para">A dual-homed host can only provide services by proxying them, or by
having users log into the dual-homed host directly. As we discuss in
<a class="xref" href="ch05_01.htm" title="Bastion Hosts">Chapter 5, <cite class="chapter">Bastion Hosts</CITE
></A
>, user accounts present significant security
problems by themselves. They present special problems on dual-homed
hosts, where they may unexpectedly enable services you consider
insecure. Furthermore, most users find it inconvenient to use a
dual-homed host by logging into it. </P
><p class="para">Proxying is much less problematic, but may not be available for all
services you're interested in. <a class="xref" href="ch07_01.htm" title="Proxy Systems">Chapter 7</A
> discusses
some workarounds for this situation, but they do not apply in every
case. The screened subnet architecture we describe in the next section
offers some extra options for providing new and/or untrusted
services (e.g., you can add to the screened subnet a worthless machine
that provides only an untrusted service).<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1879"></A

>Whereas a dual-homed host architecture provides services from a host

host that's attached to only the internal network, using a separate
router. In this architecture, the primary security is provided by packet
filtering. (For example, packet filtering is what prevents people from
going around proxy servers to make direct connections.) </P

></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire0404.gif" alt="Figure 4.4"><p class="para">The bastion host sits on the internal network. The packet filtering on
the screening router is set up in such a way that the bastion host is
the only system on the internal network that hosts on the Internet can
open connections to (for example, to deliver incoming email). Even
then, only certain types of connections are allowed. Any external
system trying to access internal systems or services will have to
connect to this host. The bastion host thus needs to maintain a high
level of host security.</P
><p class="para">The packet filtering also permits the bastion host to open allowable
connections (what is &quot;allowable&quot; will be determined by
your site's particular security policy) to the outside world. The
section about bastion hosts in the discussion of the screened subnet
architecture later in this chapter, contains more information about
the functions of bastion hosts, and <a class="xref" href="ch05_01.htm" title="Bastion Hosts">Chapter 5</A
>
describes in detail how to build one.</P
><p class="para">The packet filtering configuration in the screening router may do one of
the following:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Allow other internal hosts to open connections to hosts on the
Internet for certain services (allowing those services via packet
filtering, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch06_01.htm" title="Packet Filtering">Chapter 6</A
>),</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Disallow all connections from internal hosts (forcing
those hosts to use proxy services via the bastion host, as discussed in
<a class="xref" href="ch07_01.htm" title="Proxy Systems">Chapter 7</A
>).</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">You can mix and match these approaches for different services; some
may be allowed directly via packet filtering, while others may be
allowed only indirectly via proxy. It all depends on the particular
policy your site is trying to enforce.</P
><p class="para">Because this architecture allows packets to move from the Internet to
the internal networks, it may seem more risky than a dual-homed host
architecture, which is designed so that no external packet can 
reach the internal network. In practice, however, the dual-homed host
architecture is also prone to failures that let packets actually cross
from the external network to the internal network. (Because this
type of failure is completely unexpected, there are unlikely to be
protections against attacks of this kind.) Furthermore, it's easier to
defend a router, which provides a very limited set of services, than it
is to defend a host. For most purposes, the screened host architecture
provides both better security and better usability than the dual-homed
host architecture. </P
><p class="para">Compared to other architectures, however, such as the screened subnet
architecture discussed in the following section, there are some
disadvantages to the screened host architecture. The major one is that
if an attacker manages to break in to the bastion host, there is nothing
left in the way of network security between the bastion host and the
rest of the internal hosts. The router also presents a single point of
failure; if the router is compromised, the entire network is available
to an attacker. For this reason, the screened subnet architecture has
become increasingly popular.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1913"></A

>The <em class="emphasis">screened subnet architecture</EM
> adds an extra
layer of security to the screened host architecture by adding a
perimeter network that further isolates the internal network from the
Internet. </P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="CH04BASTHOSTISO"></A
>Why do this? By their nature, bastion hosts are the most vulnerable
machines on your network. Despite your best efforts to protect them,
they are the machines most likely to be attacked, because they're the
machines that <em class="emphasis">can be</EM
> attacked. If, as in a screened
host architecture, your internal network is wide open to attack from
your bastion host, then your bastion host is a very tempting target. 
There are no other defenses between it and your other internal machines
(besides whatever host security they may have, which is usually very
little). If someone successfully breaks into the bastion host in a
screened host architecture, he's hit the jackpot.</P
><p class="para">By isolating the bastion host on a perimeter network, you can reduce the
impact of a break-in on the bastion host. It is no longer an
instantaneous jackpot; it gives an intruder some access, but not all.</P
><p class="para">With the simplest type of screened subnet architecture, there are two
screening routers, each connected to the perimeter net. One sits
between the perimeter net and the internal network, and the other sits
between the perimeter net and the external network (usually the
Internet). To break into the internal network with this type of
architecture, an attacker would have to get past <em class="emphasis">both
 </EM
>routers. Even if the attacker somehow broke in to the bastion
host, he'd still have to get past the interior router. There is no
single vulnerable point that will compromise the internal network.</P
><p class="para">Some sites go so far as to create a layered series of perimeter nets
between the outside world and their interior network. Less trusted and
more vulnerable services are placed on the outer perimeter nets,
fathest from the interior network. The idea is that an attacker who
breaks into a machine on an outer perimeter net will have a harder
time successfully attacking internal machines because of the
additional layers of security between the outer perimeter and the
internal network. This is only true if there is actually some meaning
to the different layers, however; if the filtering systems between
each layer allow the same things between all layers, the
additional layers don't provide any additional security.</P

that uses the screened subnet architecture. The next few sections

>The perimeter network is another layer of security, an additional
network between the external network and your protected internal
network. If an attacker successfully breaks into the outer reaches of
your firewall, the perimeter net offers an additional layer of
protection between that attacker and your internal systems.</P
><p class="para">Here's an example of why a perimeter network can be helpful. In many
network setups,  it's possible for any machine on a given network to
see the traffic for every machine on that network. This is true for
most Ethernet-based networks, (and Ethernet is by far the most common
local area networking technology in use today); it is also true for
several other popular technologies, such as token ring and
<span class="acronym">FDDI</SPAN
>. Snoopers may succeed in picking up passwords
by watching for those used during Telnet, <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>,
and <em class="emphasis">rlogin</EM
> sessions. Even if passwords aren't
compromised, snoopers can still peek at the contents of 
sensitive files people may be accessing, interesting email they
may be reading, and so on; the snooper can essentially &quot;watch over
the shoulder&quot; of anyone using the network.</P
><p class="para">With a perimeter network, if someone breaks into a bastion host on the
perimeter net, he'll be able to snoop only on traffic on that net. All
the traffic on the perimeter net should be either to or from the
bastion host, or to or from the Internet. Because no strictly internal
traffic (that is, traffic between two internal hosts, which is
presumably sensitive or proprietary) passes over the perimeter net,
internal traffic will be safe from prying eyes if the bastion host is
compromised.</P
><p class="para">Obviously, traffic to and from the bastion host, or the external world,
will still be visible. Part of the work in designing a firewall is
ensuring that this traffic is not itself confidential enough that
reading it will compromise your site as a whole. (This is discussed in
<a class="xref" href="ch05_01.htm" title="Bastion Hosts">Chapter 5</A

 safely support and safely provide using packet filtering
 rather than proxies. (Your site needs to establish its own definition
 of what &quot;safe&quot; means. You'll have to consider your own
 needs, capabilities, and constraints; there is no one answer for all
 sites.)  The services you allow might include outgoing Telnet,

 others, as appropriate for your own needs and concerns.  (For

><p class="para">The services the interior router allows between your bastion host
(on the perimeter net itself) and your internal net are not necessarily
the same services the interior router allows between the Internet
and your internal net. The reason for limiting the services between the
bastion host and the internal network is to reduce the number of
machines (and the number of services on those machines) that can be
attacked from the bastion host, should it be compromised. </P

>In theory, the <em class="emphasis">exterior router </EM
>(sometimes called
the <em class="emphasis">access router</EM

protects both the perimeter net and the internal net from the
Internet. In practice, exterior routers tend to allow almost anything
outbound from the perimeter net, and they generally do very little
packet filtering.  The packet filtering rules to protect internal
machines would need to be essentially the same on both the interior
router and the exterior router; if there's an error in the rules that
allows access to an attacker, the error will probably be present on
both routers.</P
><p class="para">Frequently, the exterior router is provided by an external group (for
example, your Internet provider), and your access to it may be
limited.  An external group that's maintaining a router will probably
be willing to put in a few general packet filtering rules, but won't
want to maintain a complicated or frequently changing rule set. You
also may not trust them as much as you trust your own routers. If the
router breaks and they install a new one, are they going to remember
to reinstall the filters? Are they even going to bother to mention
that they replaced the router so that you know to check?</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2028"></A
>The only packet filtering rules that are really special on the
exterior router are those that protect the machines on the perimeter
net (that is, the bastion hosts and the internal
router). Generally, however, not much protection is necessary, because
the hosts on the perimeter net are protected primarily through host
security (although redundancy never hurts).</P
><p class="para">The rest of the rules that you could put on the exterior router are
duplicates of the rules on the interior router. These are the rules
that prevent insecure traffic from going between internal hosts and
the Internet. To support proxy services, where the interior router
will let the internal hosts send some protocols as long as they are
talking <em class="emphasis">to</EM
> the bastion host, the exterior router
could let those protocols through as long as they are coming
<em class="emphasis">from</EM
> the bastion host. These rules are desirable
for an extra level of security, but they're theoretically blocking
only packets that can't exist because they've already been blocked by
the interior router. If they do exist, either the interior router has
failed, or somebody has connected an unexpected host to the perimeter
network.</P
><p class="para">So, what does the exterior router actually need to do? One of the
security tasks that the exterior router <em class="emphasis">can</EM
>
usefully perform&nbsp;- a task that usually can't easily be done anywhere
else&nbsp;- is the blocking of any incoming packets from the Internet that
have forged source addresses. Such packets claim to have come from
within the internal network, but actually are coming in from the
Internet.</P
><p class="para">The interior router could do this, but it can't tell if packets that
claim to be from the perimeter net are forged. While the perimeter net
shouldn't have anything fully trusted on it, it's still going to be
more trusted than the external universe; being able to forge packets
from it will give an attacker most of the benefits of compromising the
bastion host. The exterior router is at a clearer boundary. The
interior router also can't protect the systems on the perimeter net
against forged packets. (We'll discuss forged packets in greater
detail in <a class="xref" href="ch06_01.htm" title="Packet Filtering">Chapter 6</A
