>There are a variety of services that are used to manage and
maintain networks; these are services that most users don't use
directly&nbsp;- indeed, that many of them have never even heard of&nbsp;- but they are
very important tools for network managers.</P

>The two most common network management tools are
<em class="emphasis">ping</EM
> and <em class="emphasis">traceroute</EM
>. Both
are named after the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> programs that were the
first implementations, but both are now available in some form on
almost all Internet-capable platforms. They do not have their own
protocols, but make use of the same underlying protocol, the Internet
Control Message Protocol (<span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
>). Unlike most of
the programs we've discussed, they are not clients of distinguishable
servers. <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> is implemented at a low level as a
required part of the <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN
> protocols all
Internet hosts use.</P
><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">ping</EM
> simply tests reachability; it tells you
whether or not you can get a packet to and from a given host, and
often additional information like how long it took the packet to make
the round trip. <em class="emphasis">traceroute</EM
> tells you not only
whether you can reach a given host (and whether it can answer), but
also the route your packets take to get to that host; this is
very useful in analyzing and debugging network trouble somewhere
between you and some destination.</P
><p class="para">Because there aren't servers for <em class="emphasis">ping</EM
> and
<em class="emphasis">traceroute</EM
>, you can't simply decide not to turn
the servers on. It's possible to use packet filtering to prevent the
packets from being transmitted from your site or received at your
site, but it's usually not necessary. There are no known risks for
outbound <em class="emphasis">ping</EM
> or <em class="emphasis">traceroute</EM
>,
and very few for inbound <em class="emphasis">ping </EM
> and
<em class="emphasis">traceroute. </EM
>They can be used for denial of
service attacks, but no more so than other protocols. More
threateningly, they can be used to determine which hosts at your site
exist, as a preliminary step to attacking them. For this reason, many
sites either prevent or limit the relevant packets inbound.</P

>Simple Network Management Protocol (<span class="acronym">SNMP</SPAN
>) is a
protocol designed to make it easy to centrally manage network
equipment (routers, bridges, concentrators, hubs, and, to a certain
extent, even hosts). <span class="acronym">SNMP</SPAN
> management stations can
request information (whether a given interface is up or
down, how many bytes have been moved through that interface, how many
errors there have been on that interface, etc.) from network equipment
via <span class="acronym">SNMP</SPAN
>. <span class="acronym">SNMP</SPAN
> management
stations can also control certain functions of the network equipment
(taking an interface up or down, setting its parameters, and so
on). The network equipment can also report urgent information (for
example, that a line has gone down, or that there are a significant
number of errors occurring on a given line) to <span class="acronym">SNMP</SPAN
>
management stations via <span class="acronym">SNMP</SPAN
>. The major security
risk with <span class="acronym">SNMP</SPAN
> is that someone else might be able
to take over control of your network equipment and reconfigure it for
their purposes (disabling packet filtering, changing routing, or
simply trashing your configuration).</P
