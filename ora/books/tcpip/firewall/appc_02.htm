><p class="para">To discuss computer networking, it is necessary to use terms that have
special meaning in data communications. Even other computer
professionals may not be familiar with all the terms in the networking
alphabet soup. As is always the case, English and computer-speak are not
equivalent (or even necessarily compatible) languages. Although
descriptions and examples should make the meaning of the networking
jargon more apparent, sometimes terms are ambiguous. A common frame of
reference is necessary for understanding data communications
terminology.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-C-S2-3">C.2.1 <span class="acronym">OSI</SPAN

></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="COSI"></A
>An architectural model developed by the International Standards
Organization (<span class="acronym">ISO</SPAN
>) is frequently used to describe
the structure and function of data communications protocols. This
architectural model, called the Open Systems Interconnect
(<span class="acronym">OSI</SPAN
>) Reference Model, provides a common reference
for discussing communications. The terms defined by this model are
well understood and widely used in the data communications
community&nbsp;- so widely used, in fact, that it is difficult to discuss
data communications without using <span class="acronym">OSI</SPAN
>'s
terminology.</P
><p class="para">The <span class="acronym">OSI</SPAN
> Reference Model contains seven
<em class="emphasis">layers</EM
> that define the functions of data
communications protocols. Each layer of the <span class="acronym">OSI</SPAN
>
model represents a function performed when data is transferred between
cooperating applications across an intervening network. <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-C-FIG-1" title="The OSI Reference Model">Figure 13.5</A
> identifies each layer by name and provides a
short functional description for it. Looking at this figure, you can
see that the protocols are like a pile of building blocks stacked one
upon another. Because of this appearance, the structure is often
called a <em class="emphasis">stack</EM
> or <em class="emphasis">protocol
stack</EM
>.</P
><h4 class="figure"><a class="title" name="FIRE-C-FIG-1">Figure 13.5: The <span class="acronym">OSI</SPAN
> Reference Model</A
></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/firec01.gif" alt="Figure 13.5"><p class="para">A layer does not define a single protocol; it defines a data
communications function that may be performed by any number of
protocols. Therefore, each layer may contain multiple protocols, each
providing a service suitable to the function of that layer. For
example, a file transfer protocol and an electronic mail protocol both
provide user services and both are part of the Application
Layer. Every protocol communicates with its peer. A
<em class="emphasis">peer</EM
> is an implementation of the same protocol in
the equivalent layer on a remote system (i.e., the local file transfer
protocol is the peer of a remote file transfer protocol). Peer level
communications must be standardized for successful communications to
take place. In the abstract, each protocol is only concerned with
communicating to its peer; it does not care about the layer above or
below it.</P
><p class="para">However, there must also be agreement on how to pass data between the
layers on a single computer, because every layer is involved in sending
data from a local application to an equivalent remote application. The
upper layers rely on the lower layers to transfer the data over the
underlying network. Data is passed down the stack from one layer to the
next, until it is transmitted over the network by the Physical Layer
protocols. At the remote end, the data is passed up the stack to the
receiving application. The individual layers do not need to know how the
layers above and below them function; they only need to know how to pass
data to them. Isolating network communications functions in different
layers minimizes the impact of technological change on the entire
protocol suite. New applications can be added without changing the
physical network, and new network hardware can be installed without
rewriting the application software.</P
><p class="para">Although the <span class="acronym">OSI</SPAN
> model is useful, the
<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN
> protocols don't match its structure exactly.
Therefore, in our discussions of <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN
> we use the
layers of the <span class="acronym">OSI</SPAN
> model in the following way:</P
><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Application Layer</EM

><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">The Application Layer is the level of the protocol hierarchy where
user-accessed network processes reside. In this text a
<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN

occurs above the Transport Layer. This includes all of the processes
that users directly interact with, as well as other processes at this
level that users are not necessarily aware of.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Presentation Layer</EM

><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">For cooperating applications to exchange data, they must agree about
how data is represented. In <span class="acronym">OSI</SPAN

as a separate layer in the <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN

sessions (connection) between cooperating applications. In
<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN

Transport Layer, and the term &quot;session&quot; is not used. For

receiver gets the data exactly as it was sent. In
<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN

Transmission Control Protocol (<span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN

<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN

User Datagram Protocol (<span class="acronym">UDP</SPAN

the end-to-end reliability checks.</P

the upper layer protocols from the details of the underlying
network. The Internet Protocol (<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN

the upper layers from the underlying network and handles the

<span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN

network wiring such as <span class="acronym">IEEE</SPAN
