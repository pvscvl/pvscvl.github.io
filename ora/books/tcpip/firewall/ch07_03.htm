>An <em class="emphasis">application-level proxy</EM
> is one that knows
about the particular application it is providing proxy services for;
it understands and interprets the commands in the application
protocol. A <em class="emphasis">circuit-level proxy</EM
> is one that
creates a circuit between the client and the server without
interpreting the application protocol. The most extreme version of an
application-level proxy is an application like
<em class="emphasis">Sendmail</EM
>, which implements a store-and-forward
protocol. The most extreme version of a circuit-level proxy is one of
the modern hybrid proxy gateways that looks like a proxy to the
outside but like a filtering router to the inside.</P
><p class="para">In general, application-level proxies use modified procedures, and
circuit-level proxies use modified clients. This has to do with the
practicalities of proxying. In order to make a proxy connection, you
have to know where the connection is supposed to go. A hybrid gateway
can simply intercept connections, but a proxying host can only receive
connections that are bound for it; something else has to tell it where
to make the onward connection. An application-level proxy can get that
information in the application protocol (either by using design
features, or by reinterpreting user-supplied data). A circuit-level
proxy can't interpret the application protocol and needs to have the
information supplied to it through other means (e.g., by using a
modified client that gives the server the destination
address). Because the ability to use unmodified clients is a useful
feature, application-level proxies generally are designed to take
advantage of their application protocol knowledge (so they use
modified procedures). Circuit-level proxies usually have no way to
use modified procedures, so they use modified clients.</P
><p class="para">Although there are no known modified-client application-level proxies,
there are modified-procedure circuit-level proxies.
<em class="emphasis">plug-gw</EM
>, for example, described in &quot;Generic
Proxying with <span class="acronym">TIS FWTK</SPAN
>&quot; later in this
chapter, uses modified procedures (the connection is made to the proxy
server, instead of the destination host) and is a circuit-level
proxy. It bases destination decisions purely on the source address,
and the source and destination ports of the connection.</P
><p class="para">The advantage of a circuit-level proxy is that it provides service for
a wide variety of different protocols. Most circuit-level proxy
servers are also<em class="emphasis"> </EM
>generic proxy servers; they can
be adapted to serve almost any protocol. Not every protocol can easily
be handled by a circuit-level proxy, however. Protocols like
<span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>, which communicate port data from the client to
the server, require some protocol-level intervention, and thus some
application-level knowledge. The disadvantage of a circuit-level
proxy server is that it provides very little control over what happens
through the proxy. Like a packet filter, it controls connections on
the basis of their source and destination and can't easily determine
whether the commands going through it are safe or even in the expected
protocol. Circuit-level proxies are easily fooled by servers set up at
the port numbers assigned to other servers.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7275"></A

>Although &quot;application-level&quot; and
&quot;circuit-level&quot; are frequently used terms, we more often
distinguish between &quot;dedicated&quot; and &quot;generic&quot;
proxy servers. A <em class="emphasis">dedicated proxy server</EM
> is one
that serves a single protocol; a <em class="emphasis">generic proxy
server</EM
> is one that serves multiple protocols. In practice,
dedicated proxy servers are application-level, and generic proxy
servers are circuit-level. Depending on how you argue about shades of
meaning, it might be possible to produce a generic application-level
proxy server (one that understands a wide range of protocols) or a
dedicated circuit-level proxy server (one that provides only one
service, but doesn't understand the protocol for it). Neither of these
ever occur, however, so we use &quot;dedicated&quot; and
&quot;generic&quot; merely because we find them somewhat more
intuitive terms than &quot;application-level&quot; and
&quot;circuit-level.&quot;</P

>A proxy server can do a great deal more than simply relay requests;
one that does is an <em class="emphasis">intelligent proxy server</EM
>.
For example, the <span class="acronym">CERN</SPAN
> <span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> proxy
server caches data, so that multiple requests for the same data don't
go out across the Internet. Proxy servers (particularly
application-level servers) can provide better logging and access
controls than those achieved through other methods, although few
existing proxy servers take full advantage of the opportunities. As
proxy servers mature, their abilities are increasing rapidly. Now that
there are multiple proxy suites that provide basic functionality,
they're beginning to compete by adding features. It's easier for a
dedicated, application-level proxy server to be intelligent; a
circuit-level proxy has limited abilities.</P
