>Gopher is a menu-oriented, text-based tool that helps
users find information on the Internet. &quot;Gopher&quot; isn't an
acronym for anything; it was developed at the University of Minnesota,
whose mascot is the &quot;Golden Gopher.&quot; Information on a
Gopher server is organized as a series of hierarchical menus from
which a user selects items. Each item can be a file, a form, or an
additional menu, with its own items. There are a number of different
Gopher clients available, including free, shareware, and commercial
clients for Windows, Macintosh, and <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>. Gopher
clients and servers use an extensible data scheme, much as Web clients
and servers do, and are thus subject to many of the same security
concerns.</P

>Wide Area Information Service (<span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
>) was developed
by a consortium of companies: Thinking Machines, Apple, Dow Jones, and
<span class="acronym">KPMG</SPAN
> Peat Marwick; the development was led by
Brewster Kahle. A <span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
> user submits a simple query
(typically a keyword or a phrase), and the <span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
>
server sends back a list of the documents containing those words,
along with a score for each document. This score is a composite of the
number of times the keywords are mentioned and the length of the
document; shorter documents get higher scores, as do documents that
mention the keywords more often. The list of documents is returned
sorted by score, so that with any luck the most relevant documents
appear first in the list. The server maintains extensive indexes of
the contents of all the documents on the server to allow it to do
these searches efficiently. There are currently several hundred
<span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
> servers on the Internet. You can access them
with <span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
>-protocol clients, or by using a Web
browser to access one of the sites that provides
<span class="acronym">HTTP-WAIS</SPAN
> gateways (e.g.,
<a class="systemitem.url" href="../../../../../../../www.ai.mit.edu/the-net/wais.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/the-net/wais.html</A
>).</P

>Archie is an Internet service that searches indexes of anonymous FTP
servers for file and directory names. Archie servers typically provide
service via Telnet and email in addition to dedicated Archie clients.
Archie service providers generally prefer that users use dedicated
Archie clients, because they impose less of a load on the server.
Archie is also accessible through Web browsers via sites that provide
<span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
>-Archie gateways, such as the one at
<a class="systemitem.url" href="../../../../../../../www.nexor.co.uk/archie.html">http://www.nexor.co.uk/archie.html</A
>. At this
point, there are only about 20 Archie servers throughout the world,
partly because of the significant resources (computing power, disk
space, network bandwidth, and administrator time) required to run an
Archie server, and partly because each Archie server searches much of
the Internet for <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>'able files on a regular
basis. If there were a large number of Archie servers, so much
bandwidth would be consumed looking for resources that it would be
impossible to use the resources.</P
><p class="para"><span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
> and Archie are less open to mischief than
<span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> and Gopher, because they don't return data of
arbitrary types. If a <span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
> server advises you that
a document is about gardening, and it turns out to be about
manufacturing jewelry in your spare time, this may be annoying, but
it's not a problem for the security of your computers. Unfortunately,
providing access to some of these services may open other security
holes unrelated to the service itself. For example, allowing your
users to access Archie directly may allow attackers to access your
<span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
> and <span class="acronym">NIS/YP</SPAN
> servers, as we
discuss in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A
>.</P
><p class="para">Running servers is somewhat riskier. Unlike the clients, the servers
for these protocols&nbsp;- including <span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
> and
Archie&nbsp;- accept arbitrary queries, and you must be sure that they
aren't going to produce unexpected results. Any server that acts on
requests from potentially hostile users is vulnerable to denial of
service attacks and to executing unexpected commands on the server
machine with the permissions of the server program.</P
