>In <a class="xref" href="ch01_01.htm" title="Why Internet Firewalls?">Chapter 1, <cite class="chapter">Why Internet Firewalls?</CITE
></A
> we discussed, in general
terms, what you're trying to protect when you connect to the Internet:
your data, your resources, and your reputation. In designing an
Internet firewall, your concerns are more specific; what you need to
protect are those services you're going to use or provide over the
Internet.</P
><p class="para">There are a number of standard Internet services that users want and
that most sites try to support. There are important reasons to use
these services; indeed, without them, there is little reason to be
connected to the Internet at all. But there are also potential security
problems with each of them. </P
><p class="para">What services do you want to support at your site? Which ones can you
support securely? Every site is different. Every site has its own
security policy and its own working environment. For example, do all
your users need electronic mail? Do they all need to
transfer files outside your organization? How about downloading files
from sites outside the organization's own network? Who should be able
to log in remotely from another location over the Internet?</P
><p class="para">This chapter briefly summarizes the major Internet services your
users may be interested in using. It provides only a high-level
summary (details are given in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8, <cite class="chapter">Configuring Internet Services</CITE
></A
>). None of
these services are really secure; each one has its own security
weaknesses, and each has been exploited in various ways by attackers.
Before you decide to support a service at your site, you will have to
assess how important it is to your users and whether you will be able
to protect them from its dangers. There are various ways of doing
this: running the services only on certain protected machines, using
especially secure variants of the standard services; or, in some
cases, blocking the services completely to or from some or all outside
systems.</P
><p class="para">This chapter doesn't list every Internet service&nbsp;- it can't. Such a
list would be incomplete as soon as it was finished, and would include
services of interest only to a few sites in the world. Instead,
we attempt to list the major services, and we hope this book will give
you the background you need to make decisions about new services as you
encounter them.</P
><p class="para">Managers and system administrators together need to decide which
services to support at your site and to what extent. <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A
> describes what is necessary to support these
services securely once you've decided to provide them, and the
decisions you may need to make about them when building your site's
firewall.</P

><p class="para">Are you just getting connected? Or, have you been connected for a while
but are getting concerned about Internet security? Where should
you start? Many system administrators try to be too ambitious. If you
attempt to develop and deploy the be-all and end-all of firewall systems
right from day one, you probably aren't going to succeed. The field is
just too complex, and the technology is changing so fast that it will
change out from under you before you get such an endeavor
&quot;finished.&quot;</P
><p class="para">Start small. At many sites, it boils down to six basic services. 
If you can provide these services securely, most of your users will be
satisfied, at least for a while.

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Electronic mail (<span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN

five services by translating Internet hostnames to

></LI
></UL
>
 </P
><p class="para">All six of these services can be safely provided in a number of
different ways, including packet filtering and proxies&nbsp;- firewall
approaches discussed in Part II of this book. Providing
these services lets your users access most Internet resources, and it
buys you time to figure out how to provide the rest of the services
they'll be asking for soon, such as Archie, Gopher,
<span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
>, and other information services.</P

>Electronic mail is one of the most popular and basic
network services.  It's relatively low risk, but that doesn't mean
it's risk free. Forging electronic mail is trivial (just as is forging
regular postal mail), and forgeries facilitate two different types of
attacks: attacks against your reputation and social manipulation
attacks (e.g., attacks in which users are sent mail purporting to come
from an administrator and advising them to change to a specific
password). Accepting electronic mail ties up computer time and disk
space, opening you up for denial of service attacks, although with
proper configuration, only email service will be denied. Particularly
with modern multimedia mail systems, people can send electronic mail
containing programs that run with insufficient supervision and may
turn out to be <em class="emphasis">Trojan horses</EM
>.</P
><p class="para">Although people worry most about the last risk mentioned
above, in practice the most common problems with electronic mail are
inadvertent floods (including chain letters) and people who put entirely
inappropriate confidence in the confidentiality of electronic mail and
send proprietary data via electronic mail across the Internet. However,
as long as users are educated, and the mail service is isolated from
other services so that inadvertent or purposeful denial of service
attacks shut down as little as possible, electronic mail is reasonably
safe.</P

>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (<span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN
>) is
the Internet standard protocol for sending and receiving electronic
mail. <span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN
> itself is not usually a security
problem, but <span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN
> servers can be. A program that
delivers mail to users often needs to be able to run as any user that
might receive mail. This gives it broad power and makes it a tempting
target for attackers.</P

>The most common <span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN
> server on
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> is Sendmail. Sendmail has been exploited in a
number of break-ins, including the Internet worm, which makes people
nervous about using it. Many of the available replacements, however,
are not clearly preferable to Sendmail; the evidence suggests they are
less exploited because they are less popular, not because they are
less vulnerable. There are exceptions in programs designed explicitly
for security, but these don't support all the functions necessary to
send and receive arbitrary mail messages; some things are still best
handled by Sendmail running in a secured space.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-720"></A
