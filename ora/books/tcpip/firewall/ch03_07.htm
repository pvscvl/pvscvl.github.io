>Just as you may get additional security from using a number of different
systems to provide depth of defense, you may also get additional
security from using a number of different types of
systems. If all of your systems are the same, somebody who knows how to
break into one of them probably knows how to break into all of them.</P
><p class="para">The idea behind <em class="emphasis">diversity of defense</EM
> is that
using security systems from different vendors may reduce the chances
of a common bug or configuration error that compromises them
all. There is a tradeoff in terms of complexity and cost,
however. Procuring and installing multiple different systems is going
to be more difficult, take longer, and be more expensive than
procuring and installing a single system (or even several identical
systems). You're going to have to buy the multiple systems (at reduced
discounts from each vendor, because you're buying less from them) and
multiple support contracts to cover them. It's also going to take
additional time and effort for your staff to learn how to deal with
these different systems.</P
><p class="para">Beware of illusionary diversity. Simply using different vendors'
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> systems probably won't buy you diversity,
because most <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> systems are derived from either
the <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> or System V source code. Further, most
common <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> networking applications (such as
Sendmail, <em class="emphasis">telnet/telnetd</EM
>,
<em class="emphasis">ftp/ftpd</EM
>, and so on), are derived from the
<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> sources, regardless of whether they're on a
<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>- or System V-based platform. There were any
number of bugs and security problems in the original releases that
were propagated into most of the various vendor-specific versions of
these operating systems; many vendor-specific versions of
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> still have bugs and security problems that
were first discovered years ago in other versions from other vendors,
and have not yet been fixed.</P
><p class="para">Also beware that diverse systems configured by the same person (or
group of people) may share common problems if the problems stem from
conceptual rather than technological roots. If the problem is a
misunderstanding about how a particular protocol works, for example,
your diverse systems may all be configured incorrectly in the same way
according to that misunderstanding.</P
><p class="para">Although many sites acknowledge that using multiple types of systems
could potentially increase their security, they often conclude that
diversity of defense is more trouble than it's worth, and that the
potential gains and security improvements aren't worth the costs. We
don't dispute this; each site needs to make its own evaluation and
decision concerning this issue.</P
