>While electronic mail allows people to communicate, it's most efficient
as a way for one person to send a message to another, or to a
small list of people interested in a particular topic. Newsgroups are
the Internet counterpart to bulletin boards, and are designed for
many-to-many communication. Mailing lists also support many-to-many
communication, but much less openly and efficiently, because there's no
easy way to find out about all mailing lists, and every recipient has
his own copy of every message. The largest discussion mailing lists
(i.e., lists where discussions take place among subscribers, rather than
lists used to simply distribute information or announcements to
subscribers) have tens of thousands of subscribers; the most popular
newsgroups have hundreds of thousands. Usenet news is rather like
television: there's a lot going on; most of it has little socially
redeeming value; some of it is fantastically amusing or informative; and
everybody wants it. </P
><p class="para">The risks of news are much like those of electronic mail: your users
might foolishly trust information received; they might release
confidential information; and you might get flooded. News resembles a
flood when it's functioning normally&nbsp;- most sites receive
hundreds of megabytes a day, and the amount increases steadily, doubling
in volume approximately every six months&nbsp;- so you must make
absolutely sure to configure news so that floods don't affect other
services. Because news is rarely an essential service, denial of
service attacks on a single site are usually just ignored. The security
risks of news are therefore quite low. You might want to avoid news
because you don't have the bandwidth or the disk space to spare, but it's
not a significant security problem. </P

>Network News Transfer Protocol (<span class="acronym">NNTP</SPAN
>) is used to
transfer news across the Internet. In setting up the news server at
your site, you'll need to determine the most secure way for news to
flow into your internal systems so <span class="acronym">NNTP</SPAN
> can't be
used to penetrate your system. Some sites put the news server on the
bastion host, others on an internal system, as we'll describe in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A
>. <span class="acronym">NNTP</SPAN
> doesn't do much, and
your external transfers of news will all be with specific other
machines (it's not like mail, which you want to receive from
everybody), so it's not particularly difficult to secure.</P

>The biggest security issue you'll face with news is what to do with
private newsgroups. Many sites create private local newsgroups to
facilitate discussions among their users; these private newsgroups
often contain sensitive, confidential, or proprietary
information. Someone who can access your <span class="acronym">NNTP</SPAN
>
server can potentially access these private newsgroups, resulting in
disclosure of this information. If you're going to create private
newsgroups, be sure to configure <span class="acronym">NNTP</SPAN
> carefully to
control access to these groups. (The configuring of
<span class="acronym">NNTP</SPAN
> to work in a firewall environment is discussed
more fully in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A
>.)</P
