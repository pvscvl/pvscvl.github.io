>The details of how proxying works differ from service to service. Some
services provide proxying easily or automatically; for those services,
you set up proxying by making configuration changes to normal servers.
For most services, however, proxying requires appropriate proxy server
software on the server side. On the client side, it needs one of the
following:</P
><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Custom client software</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">With this approach, the software must know how to contact the proxy
server instead of the real server when a user makes a request (for
example, for <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> or Telnet), and how to tell the
proxy server what real server to connect.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Custom user procedures </EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">With this approach, the user uses standard client software to talk to
the proxy server and tells it to connect to the real server, instead of
to the real server directly.</P

Proxying</A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7191"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7194"></A
>The first approach is to use custom client software for proxying. There
are a few problems associated with this approach.</P
><p class="para">Appropriate custom client software is often available only for certain
platforms. If it's not available for one of your platforms, your users
are pretty much out of luck. For example, the <em class="emphasis">Igateway</EM
>
package from Sun (written by Jim Thompson) is a proxy package for
<span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> and <span class="acronym">TELNET</SPAN
>, but you can only
use it on Sun machines because it provides only precompiled Sun
binaries. If you're going to use proxy software, you obviously need to
choose software that's available for the needed platforms. </P
><p class="para">Even if software is available for your platforms, it may not be
software your users want. For example, on the Macintosh, there are
dozens of <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> client programs. Some of them have
really impressive graphical user interfaces. Others have other useful
features; for example, <em class="emphasis">anarchie</EM
> is a program that
combines an Archie client and an <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> client into a
single program, so that you can search for a file with Archie and then
retrieve it with <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>, all with a single consistent
user interface. You're out of luck if the particular client you want
to use, for whatever reason, doesn't support your particular proxy
server mechanism. In some cases, you may be able to modify clients to
support your proxy server, but doing so requires that you have the
source code for the client, as well as the tools and the ability to
recompile it. Few client programs come with support for any form of
proxying.</P
><p class="para">The happy exception to this rule is <span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
> client
programs, like Mosaic. Many of these programs support proxies of
various sorts (typically <span class="acronym">SOCKS</SPAN
> and the
<span class="acronym">CERN</SPAN
> <span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> daemon). Most of
these programs are fairly new, and were thus written after firewalls
and proxy systems had become common on the Internet; recognizing the
environment they would be working in, their authors chose to support
proxying by design, right from the start.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7212"></A
>Using client changes for proxying does not make proxying completely
transparent to users. Most sites will use the unchanged clients for
internal connections and the modified ones only to make external
connections; users need to remember to use the modified program in
order to make external connections. Following procedures they've
become accustomed to using elsewhere, or procedures that are written
in books, may leave them mystified at apparently intermittent results
as internal connections succeed and external ones fail. (Using the
modified clients internally will work, but it introduces unneccessary
dependencies on the proxy server, which is why most sites avoid it.)</P
><p class="para">In addition to having to choose the right program, users may find
themselves doing extra configuration, because the proxy client needs
to know how to contact the proxy server. This shouldn't represent a
major burden, but it provides an extra place for things to go wrong.</P

Proxying</A

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7222"></A
>With the custom procedure approach, the proxy servers are designed to
work with standard client software; however, they require the users of
the software to follow custom procedures. The user tells the client to
connect to the proxy server and then tells the proxy server which host to
connect to. Because few protocols are designed to pass this kind of
information, the user needs to remember not only what the name of the
proxy server is, but also what special means are used to pass the name
of the other host.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7225"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7228"></A
>How does this work? You need to teach your users specific procedures
to follow for each protocol. Let's look at <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>.
Suppose a user wants to retrieve a file from an anonymous
<span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> server (e.g.,
<em class="emphasis">ftp.greatcircle.com</EM
>). Here's what the user does:</P
><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Using any <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> client, the user connects to your
proxy server (which is probably running on the bastion host&nbsp;- the
gateway to the Internet) instead of directly to the anonymous
<span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> server.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">At the user name prompt, in addition to specifying the name he wants
to use, the user also specifies the name of the real server he wants
to connect to. If he wants to access the anonymous
<span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> server on
<em class="emphasis">ftp.greatcircle.com</EM
>, for example, then instead of
simply typing &quot;anonymous&quot; at the prompt generated by the proxy server,
he'll type &quot;anonymous@ftp.greatcircle.com&quot;.</P
></LI
></OL
><p class="para">For a more complete example, see the discussion of the
<span class="acronym">TIS</SPAN
> Internet Firewall Toolkit later in this section.</P
><p class="para">Just as using custom software requires some modification of user
procedures, using custom procedures places limitations on which clients
you can use. Some clients try to do anonymous <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>
automatically; they won't know how to go through the proxy server. 
Some clients may interfere in simpler ways, e.g., by providing 
a graphical user interface that doesn't allow you type a user name 
long enough to hold the username and the hostname. </P
><p class="para">The main problem with using custom procedures, however, is that you
have to teach them to your users. If you have a small user base and
one that is technically adept, this may not be a problem. However, if
you have 10,000 users spread across four continents, it's going to be
a problem. On the one side, you have arrayed hundreds of books,
thousands of magazine articles, and tens of thousands of Usenet news
postings, not to mention whatever previous training or experience the
users might have had, all of which attempt to teach users the standard
way to use basic Internet services like <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>. On
the other side is your tiny voice, telling them how to use a procedure
that is at odds with all the other information they're getting. On
top of that, your users will have to remember the name of your gateway
and the details of how to use it. In any organization of a reasonable
size, this approach can't be relied upon.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7249"></A
