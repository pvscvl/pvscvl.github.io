>A bastion host is your public presence on the Internet. Think of it as
the lobby of a building. Outsiders may not be able to go up the stairs
and may not be able to get into the elevators, but they can walk
freely into the lobby and ask for what they want. (Whether or not they
will get what they ask for depends upon the building's security
policy.)  Like the lobby in your building, a bastion host is exposed
to potentially hostile elements. The bastion host is the system that
any outsiders&nbsp;- friends or possible foes&nbsp;- must ordinarily connect with
to access a system or a service that's inside your firewall.</P
><p class="para">By design, a bastion host is highly exposed, because its existence is
known to the Internet. For this reason, firewall builders and managers
need to concentrate security efforts on the bastion host. You should
pay special attention to the host's security during initial
construction and ongoing operation. Because the bastion host is the
most exposed host, it also needs to be the most fortified host.</P
><p class="para">Although we talk about a single bastion host in this chapter and
elsewhere in this book, remember there may be multiple bastion hosts
in a firewall configuration. The number depends on a site's particular
requirements and resources, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch04_01.htm" title="Firewall Design">Chapter 4, <cite class="chapter">Firewall Design</CITE
></A
>. Each is
set up according to the same general principles, using the same
general techniques.</P
><p class="para">Bastion hosts are used with many different firewall approaches and
architectures; most of the information in this chapter should be
relevant regardless of whether you're building a bastion host to use
with a firewall based on packet filtering, proxying, or a hybrid
approach. The principles and procedures for building a bastion host
are extensions of those for securing any host. You want to use them,
or variations of them, for any other host that's security critical,
and possibly for hosts that are critical in other ways (e.g.,
major servers on your internal network).</P
><div class="sect1"><h2 class="sect1"><a class="title" name="FIRE-05-S1-1">5.1 General Principles</A
></H2
><p class="para">There are two basic principles for designing and building a bastion
host: Keep it simple, and be prepared for the bastion host to be
compromised.

<dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Keep it simple</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">The simpler your bastion host is, the easier it is to secure.</P
><p class="para">Any service the bastion host offers could have software
bugs or configuration errors in it, and any bugs or errors may lead to
security problems. Therefore, you want the bastion host to do as little
as possible. It should provide the smallest set of services with the
least privileges it possibly can, while still fulfilling its role.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Be prepared for the bastion host to be
compromised</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Despite your best
efforts to ensure the security of the bastion host, break-ins can
occur. Don't be naive about it. Only by anticipating the worst, and
planning for it, will you be most likely to avert it. Always keep the
question, &quot;What if the bastion host is compromised?&quot; in
the back of your mind as you go through the steps of securing the
machine and the rest of the network.</P
><p class="para">Why do we emphasize this point? The reason is simple: the bastion host
is the machine most likely to be attacked because it's the machine
most accessible to the outside world. It's also the machine from which
attacks against your internal systems are most likely to come because
the outside world probably can't talk to your internal systems directly.
 Do your best to ensure that the bastion host <em class="emphasis">won't</EM
>
get broken into, but keep in mind the question, &quot;What if it
does?&quot;</P
><p class="para">In case the bastion host is broken into, you don't want that break-in to
lead to a compromise of the entire firewall. You can prevent this
by not letting internal machines trust the bastion host any more than is
absolutely necessary for the bastion host to function. You will need to
look carefully at each service the bastion host provides to internal
machines, and determine, on a service-by-service basis, how much trust
and privilege each service really needs to have. </P
><p class="para">Once you've made these decisions, you can use a number of mechanisms to
enforce them. For example, you might install standard access control
mechanisms (passwords, authentication devices, etc.) on the internal
hosts, or you might set up packet filtering between the bastion host and
the internal hosts.</P
