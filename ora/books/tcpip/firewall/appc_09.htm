bytes specify the host. In the address 128.66.12.1, the two high-order
bits are 1 0 so the address refers to host 12.1 on network 128.66.
Two bytes identify the network, and two identify the host. Finally, in
the class C example, 192.178.16.1, the three high-order bits are 1 1
0, so this is the address of host 1 on network 192.178.16: three

being designed, networking was limited to large organizations that
could afford substantial computer systems. The idea of a powerful
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

time, a 32-bit address seemed so large that it was divided into
classes to reduce the processing load on routers, even though dividing
the address into classes sharply reduced the number of host addresses
actually available for use. For example, assigning a large network a
single class B address, instead of six class C addresses, reduces the
load on the router because the router only needs to keep one route for
that entire organization. However, the organization that was given the
class B address probably does not have 64,000 computers, so most of
the host addresses available to the organization will never be
assigned.</P
><p class="para">The current address design, which favors routers over growth, is under
critical strain from the rapid growth of the Internet. This is a

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="CSUB"></A
>The standard structure of an <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> address can be
locally modified by using host address bits as additional network
address bits. Essentially, the &quot;dividing line&quot; between network address
bits and host address bits is moved, creating additional networks, but
reducing the maximum number of hosts that can belong to each network.
These newly designated network bits define a network within the larger
network, called a subnet.</P
><p class="para">Organizations usually decide to subnet in order to overcome
topological or organizational problems. Subnetting allows
decentralized management of host addressing. With the standard
addressing scheme, a single administrator is responsible for managing
host addresses for the entire network. By subnetting, the
administrator can delegate address assignment to smaller organizations
within the overall organization, which may be a political expedient,
if not a technical requirement. If you don't want to deal with the
data processing department, assign them their own subnet and let them
manage it themselves.</P
><p class="para">Subnetting can also be used to overcome hardware differences and
distance limitations. <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> routers can link
dissimilar physical networks together, but only if each physical
network has its own unique network address. Subnetting divides a
single network address into many unique subnet addresses, so that each
physical network can have its own unique address.</P
><p class="para">A subnet is defined by applying a bit mask, the <em class="emphasis">subnet
mask</EM
>, to the <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> address. If a bit is on
in the mask, that equivalent bit in the address is interpreted as a
network bit. If a bit in the mask is off, the bit belongs to the host
part of the address. The subnet is only known locally. To the rest of
the Internet, the address is still interpreted as a standard
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> address.</P
><p class="para">For example, the subnet mask that would be associated with standard
class B addresses is 255.255.0.0. The most commonly used subnet mask
extends the network portion of a class B address by an additional
byte. The subnet mask that does this is 255.255.255.0; all bits on in
the first three bytes, and all bits off in the last byte. The first
two bytes define the class B network; the third byte defines the the
subnet address; the fourth byte defines the host on that subnet.</P
><p class="para">Many network administrators prefer to use byte-oriented masks because
they are easier to read and understand. However, defining subnet masks
on byte boundaries is not a requirement. The subnet mask is bit-oriented
and can be applied to any address class. For example, a small
organization could subdivide a class C address into four subnets with
the mask 255.255.255.192.[5] Applying this mask to a class C address
defines the two high-order bits of the fourth byte as the subnet part of
the address. This same mask, applied to a class B address, creates more
than a thousand subnets because ten bits (the full third byte, and two
bits of the fourth byte) are used to define the subnets (2^10=1024).</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[5] This is just an illustration.  A mask that creates four 
subnets is not a good idea because a subnet address of all 
ones and an address of all zeros are reserved addresses.  
Therefore two of the four subnets could not be used.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">As subnets become more and more common, an alternative way of writing
subnet masks is becoming popular: as &quot;/bits&quot; instead of as
the four-octet netmask. For instance, &quot;/24&quot; specifies a
24-bit netmask, equivalent to 255.255.255.0, but much faster to write.
The new nomenclature makes the assumption that your netmasks are made
up of contiguous bits (i.e., that you never use a netmask of something
like 255.0.255.0), but that's standard practice anyway.</P
><p class="para">You will also sometimes hear people talk about wildcard masks,
particular with respect to Cisco routers and packet filtering
specifications. Wildcard masks are essentially the inverse of subnet
masks; where subnet masks use 1 bit to specify the significant bits
(the bits to be looked at), wildcard masks use 1 bit to specify the
insignificant bits (the bits to be ignored). Thus, a subnet mask of
255.255.0.0 is equivalent to a wildcard mask of 0.0.255.255, and a
subnet mask of 255.255.240.0 is equivalent to a wildcard mask of
0.0.15.255. The table below shows the effect of various subnet masks on different
network addresses.</P
