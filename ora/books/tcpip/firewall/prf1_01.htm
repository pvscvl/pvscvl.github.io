><p class="para">In any society, a small percentage of people are malicious. It is
estimated that the Internet now has about 30 to 40 million
users. Even if the percentage of malicious users is less than one
percent of the overall society, the potential number of malicious
users is large enough so that it should concern you.</P
><p class="para">The number of security incidents reported to the Computer Emergency
Response Team Coordination Center (<span class="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN
>)
increases every year&nbsp;- less than 200 in 1989, about 400 in 1991, 1400
in 1993, and 2,241 in 1994. Estimates are that we'll see more than
3000 reported incidents in 1995.  Incidents occur at government and
military sites, among Fortune 500 companies, at universities, and at
small startups. Some incidents involve a single account on a single
system. Some (for example, those involving packet sniffers) might
involve as many as 100,000 systems.  Of course, these numbers are only
the tip of the iceberg. Many intrusions aren't reported to the
<span class="acronym">CERT</SPAN
> Coordination Center or to other computer
security incident response organizations.  In fact, many aren't
reported at all&nbsp;- in some cases, because the victimized organization
would rather avoid publicity or charges of carelessness, in other
cases because the intrusions are not even detected.</P
><p class="para">Nobody knows the correct statistics on how many attacks are
actually detected by the sites broken into, but most people in the
security community agree that only a few percent are. Here's one of
the few statistics I can cite: one incident response team offers a
network intrusion service to its customers. With the customer's
permission, they try to penetrate a system using the same tools that
intruders use in their own attacks. This team found that only 4% of
the sites probed detected the penetration attempts. An even more
frightening estimate: Bill Cheswick of <span class="acronym">AT&T</SPAN
> Bell
Labs believes that of those attacks that do succeed, at least 40% of
the attackers gain root access.[1] </P

><p class="para">It isn't only the numbers of incidents that are growing; it's the
sophistication of the methods of attack. When the
<span class="acronym">CERT</SPAN
> Coordination Center was founded in the wake of
the Internet worm in the fall of 1988, the attacks we faced fell into
two major categories: password guessing and the exploiting of security
holes in operating systems and system programs. Although too many
sites still fall victim to such attacks, we're now seeing increasing
technical complexity in most of the newer incidents. To some extent,
this is the result of increasing consciousness among system users and
system administrators&nbsp;- users are choosing better passwords, and
administrators are applying system patches more quickly.
Unfortunately, the result of this increased security consciousness
isn't to stamp out security attacks; it's simply to force the
attackers to learn new tricks. Many of today's attacks are more
sophisticated. They include the forging of Internet Protocol
(<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>) addresses (intruders are guessing the sequence
numbers associated with network connections and the acknowledgments
between machines), the exploiting of the source routing option on
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> packets on certain types of
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> systems, and the hijacking of open terminal or
login sessions.</P
><p class="para">This is not to say that all users and administrators have learned
their lessons about old-style attacks. There is still more education
that needs to be done among users and administrators, as well as among
managers, who too often won't budget what's needed for security
training. It's a dangerous world in cyberspace, and too few people
realize it.  This is one way in which the growth of the Internet may
actually have hurt us.  In the early days of the Internet, sites
connected to the net usually had a whole staff of hardware and
software gurus. Today, connecting to the Internet is so easy that
sites forget it takes technical sophistication to connect safely and
to stay secure.</P
><p class="para">Several years ago, I worked with a site in Europe that apparently had
been broken into by someone who used a site in the United States to
launch the attack. When I contacted the system administrator at the
<span class="acronym">U.S.</SPAN
> site, she assured me that they didn't even
have computers at their location that were connected to the
Internet. I told her the full domain name of the suspect system, and
she replied, &quot;Oh, you mean the Sun.&quot; It turned out that the Sun had
been installed for use in a special application and had been running
for years without anyone at the site realizing that it was connected
to the Internet. The administrator assured me that they would
disconnect the machine. Well, next morning, the European manager sent
me another flaming email message&nbsp;- another break-in from the same
<span class="acronym">U.S.</SPAN
> system. I called the <span class="acronym">U.S.</SPAN
>
system administrator. Yes, she'd disconnected the modems. Yes, she'd
disconnected the <span class="acronym">CRT</SPAN
>s. But through it all, she'd
managed to leave the system connected to the Internet. She didn't know
it, but the attacker did, and he continued to take advantage of the
fact.</P
><p class="para">I talk to system administrators all the time who are frustrated by
break-ins, but who haven't done the basics that might prevent these
break-ins from succeeding. One system administrator complained that he
had reloaded his systems multiple times, and he was still being
attacked. It turned out that, although he knew about
<span class="acronym">CERT</SPAN
> advisories and vendor security bulletins, he'd
never bothered installing them. For example, <span class="acronym">CERT</SPAN
>
Advisory CA-93:16 was posted to the net in November of 1993; it
advised the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> community about a problem with
most versions of Sendmail. Vendors had cooperated by providing
replacement programs, and the advisory contained a replacement for the
<em class="emphasis">/bin/sh</EM
> program used in the MProg line of the
<em class="emphasis">sendmail.cf</EM
> file. A year and a half later,
<span class="acronym">CERT</SPAN
> still gets calls from sites that are broken
into using this old Sendmail vulnerability.</P
><p class="para">Although the number of security incidents continues to increase and
the types of attacks become ever more sophisticated, still there is
good news for those who care about security. Overall, we've seen a
huge growth in awareness of the dangers of connecting to the Internet,
and there's a lot of activity in the security community. One
manifestation of that is the growth of the Forum of Incident Response
and Security Teams (<span class="acronym">FIRST</SPAN
>), which brings together a
variety of computer security incident response teams (more than 40 at
the time I'm writing this) from government, commercial, and academic
organizations. Also heartening is the existence of ever-better
security tools that our community makes freely available. The Computer
Operations, Audit, and Security Technology (<span class="acronym">COAST</SPAN
>)
archive at Purdue is a central point for the collection and testing of
many of these tools.  (<a class="xref" href="appa_01.htm" title="Resources">Appendix A, <cite class="appendix">Resources</CITE
></A
> of this book tells
you how to contact both organizations.) Finally, the publication of
some excellent books and papers on Internet security makes the
hard-won wisdom of those at the front available to others.</P
><p class="para">In these dangerous times, firewalls are the best way to keep your site
secure. Although you've got to include other types of security in the
mix, if you're serious about connecting to the Internet, firewalls
should be at the very center of your security plans. Brent Chapman has
been known as the firewalls guru since the early days of firewalls on
the Internet; his Firewalls mailing list and his tutorials are
witness to that. Elizabeth Zwicky, especially through her work at the
System Administrators Guild (<span class="acronym">SAGE</SPAN
>) is the voice of
safe and rational system administration. Together, they have written a
book that will raise consciousness of, and competence in, Internet
security to a new level.</P
