>As we've mentioned, firewalls are a very effective type of network
security. This section briefly describes what Internet firewalls can
do for your overall site security. <a class="xref" href="ch04_01.htm" title="Firewall Design">Chapter 4, <cite class="chapter">Firewall Design</CITE

describes the various types of firewalls in use today, and the other
chapters in Part II describe the details of building those firewalls.</P
><p class="para">In building construction, a firewall is designed to keep a fire from
spreading from one part of the building to another. In theory, an
Internet firewall serves a similar purpose: it prevents the dangers of
the Internet from spreading to your internal network. In practice, an
Internet firewall is more like a moat of a medieval castle than a
firewall in a modern building. It serves multiple purposes:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">It restricts people to entering at a carefully controlled point.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">It prevents attackers from getting close to your other defenses.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">It restricts people to leaving at a carefully controlled point.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">An Internet firewall is most often installed at the point where your
protected internal network connects to the Internet, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-01-CHP-FIG-1" title="A firewall usually separates an internal network from the Internet">Figure 1.1</A
>. </P
><h4 class="figure"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-CHP-FIG-1">Figure 1.1: A firewall usually separates an internal network from the
Internet</A
></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire0101.gif" alt="Figure 1.1"><p class="para">All traffic coming from the Internet or going out from your internal
network passes through the firewall. Because it does, the firewall has
the opportunity to make sure that this traffic is acceptable. </P
><p class="para">What does &quot;acceptable&quot; mean to the firewall? It means that
whatever is being done&nbsp;- email, file transfers, remote logins, or any
kinds of specific interactions between specific systems&nbsp;- conforms to
the security policy of the site. Security policies are different for
every site; some are highly restrictive and others fairly open, as
we'll discuss in Chapter 11.</P
><p class="para">Logically, a firewall is a separator, a restricter, an analyzer. The
physical implementation of the firewall varies from site to site. Most
often, a firewall is a set of hardware components&nbsp;- a router, a host
computer, or some combination of routers, computers, and networks with
appropriate software. There are various ways to configure this
equipment; the configuration will depend upon a site's particular
security policy, budget, and overall operations.</P
><p class="para">A firewall is very rarely a single physical object, although some of the
newest commercial products attempt to put everything into the same box.
Usually, a firewall has multiple parts, and some of these parts may do
other tasks besides function as part of the firewall. Your Internet
connection is almost always part of your firewall. Even if you have a
firewall in a box, it isn't going to be neatly separable from the rest
of your site; it's not something you can just drop in.</P
><p class="para">We've compared a firewall to the moat of a medieval castle, and like a
moat, a firewall is not invulnerable. It doesn't protect against people
who are already inside; it works best if coupled with internal
defenses; and, even if you stock it with alligators, people sometimes
manage to swim across. A firewall is also not without its drawbacks;
building one requires significant expense and effort, and the
restrictions it places on insiders can be a major annoyance.</P
><p class="para">Given the limitations and drawbacks of firewalls, why would anybody
bother to install one? Because a firewall is the most effective way to
connect a network to the Internet and still protect that network. The
Internet presents marvelous opportunities. Millions of people are out
there exchanging information. The benefits are obvious: the chances for
publicity, customer service, and information gathering. The popularity
of the information superhighway is increasing everybody's
desire to get out there. The risks should also be obvious: any time you
get millions of people together, you get crime; it's true in a city, and
it's true on the Internet. Any superhighway is fun only while you're in
a car. If you have to live or work by the highway, it's loud, smelly,
and dangerous.</P
><p class="para">How can you benefit from the good parts of the Internet without being
overwhelmed by the bad? Just as you'd like to drive on a
highway without suffering the nasty effects of putting a freeway
off-ramp into your living room, you need to carefully control the
contact that your network has to the Internet. A firewall is a tool for
doing that, and in most situations, it's the single most effective tool
for doing that. </P
><p class="para">There are other uses of firewalls. For example, they can be used as
firewalls in a building that divide parts of a site from each other
when these parts have distinct security needs (and we'll discuss these
uses in passing, as appropriate). The focus of this book, however, is on
firewalls as they're used between a site and the Internet.</P
><p class="para">Firewalls offer significant benefits, but they can't solve every
security problem. The following sections briefly summarize what
firewalls can and cannot do to protect your systems and your data.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-536"></A
></P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S2-8">1.4.1 What Can a Firewall Do?</A
></H3
><p class="para">Firewalls can do a lot for your site's security. In fact, some
advantages of using firewalls extend even beyond security, as 
described below.</P
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-12">1.4.1.1 A firewall is a focus for security
decisions</A
></H4
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-543"></A
>Think of a firewall as a choke point. All traffic in and out must pass
through this single, narrow checkpoint. A firewall gives you an
enormous amount of leverage for network security because it lets you
concentrate your security measures on this checkpoint: the point where
your network connects to the Internet. </P
><p class="para">Focusing your security in this way is far more efficient than spreading
security decisions and technologies around, trying to cover all the
bases in a piecemeal fashion. Although firewalls can cost tens of
thousands of dollars to implement, most sites find that concentrating
the most effective security hardware and software at the firewall is
less expensive and more effective than other security measures&nbsp;- and
certainly less expensive than having inadequate security.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-13">1.4.1.2 A firewall can enforce security
policy</A
></H4
><p class="para">Many of the services that people want from the Internet are inherently
insecure. The firewall is the traffic cop for these services. It
enforces the site's security policy, allowing only
&quot;approved&quot; services to pass through and those only within
the rules set up for them.</P
><p class="para">For example, one site's management may decide that certain services
such as Sun's Network File System (<span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
>) and Network
Information Services (formerly known as Yellow Pages)
(<span class="acronym">NIS/YP</SPAN
>) are simply too risky to be used across the
firewall. It doesn't matter what system tries to run them or what user
wants them. The firewall will keep potentially dangerous services
strictly inside the firewall. (There, they can still be used for
insiders to attack each other, but that's outside of the firewall's
control.)  Another site might decide that only one internal system can
communicate with the outside world. Still another site might decide to
allow access from all systems of a certain type, or belonging to a
certain group; the variations in site security policies are endless.</P
><p class="para">A firewall may be called upon to help enforce more complicated policies.
For example, perhaps only certain systems within the firewall are
allowed to transfer files to and from the Internet; by using other
mechanisms to control which users have access to those systems, you can
control which users have these capabilities. Depending on the
technologies you choose to implement your firewall, a firewall may have
a greater or lesser ability to enforce such policies.</P

><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-14">1.4.1.3 A firewall can log Internet activity
efficiently</A

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-565"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-568"></A
>Because all traffic passes through the firewall, the firewall provides a
good place to collect information about system and network use&nbsp;- and
misuse. As a single point of access, the firewall can record what occurs
between the protected network and the external network.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-15">1.4.1.4 A firewall limits your
exposure</A
></H4
><p class="para">Although this point is most relevant to the use of internal firewalls,
which we describe in <a class="xref" href="ch04_01.htm" title="Firewall Design">Chapter 4</A
>, it's worth
mentioning here. Sometimes, a firewall will be used to keep one section
of your site's network separate from another section. By doing this,
you keep problems that impact one section from spreading through the
entire network. In some cases, you'll do this because one section of
your network may be more trusted than another; in other cases, because
one section is more sensitive than another. Whatever the reason, the
existence of the firewall limits the damage that a network security
problem can do to the overall network.</P
></DIV
></DIV
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S2-9">1.4.2 What Can't a Firewall Do?</A
></H3
><p class="para">Firewalls offer excellent protection against network threats, but they
aren't a complete security solution. Certain threats are outside the
control of the firewall. You need to figure out other ways to protect
against these threats by incorporating physical security, host security,
and user education into your overall security plan. Some of the
weaknesses of firewalls are discussed below.</P
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-16">1.4.2.1 A firewall can't protect you against
malicious insiders</A
></H4
><p class="para">A firewall might keep a system user from being able to send proprietary
information out of an organization over a network connection; so would
simply not having a network connection. But that same user could copy
the data onto disk, tape, or paper and carry it out of the building in
his or her briefcase.</P
><p class="para">If the attacker is already inside the firewall&nbsp;- if the fox is inside
the henhouse&nbsp;- a firewall can do virtually nothing for you. Inside
users can steal data, damage hardware and software, and subtly modify
programs without ever coming near the firewall. Insider threats require
internal security measures, such as host security and user education. 
Such topics are beyond the scope of this book.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-17">1.4.2.2 A firewall can't protect you against
connections that don't go through it</A
></H4
><p class="para">A firewall can effectively control the traffic that passes through it;
however, there is nothing a firewall can do about traffic that doesn't
pass through it. For example, what if the site allows dial-in access
to internal systems behind the firewall? The firewall has absolutely no
way of preventing an intruder from getting in through such a modem.</P
><p class="para">Sometimes, technically expert users or system administrators set up
their own &quot;back doors&quot; into the network (such as a dial-up
modem connection), either temporarily or permanently, because they chafe
at the restrictions that the firewall places upon them and their
systems. The firewall can do nothing about this. It's really a
people-management problem, not a technical problem.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-18">1.4.2.3 A firewall can't protect against
completely new threats</A
></H4
><p class="para">A firewall is designed to protect against known threats. A
well-designed one may also protect against new threats.  (For example,
by denying any but a few trusted services, a firewall will prevent
people from setting up new and insecure services.) However, no
firewall can automatically defend against every new threat that
arises. Periodically people discover new ways to attack, using
previously trustworthy services, or using attacks that simply hadn't
occurred to anyone before. You can't set up a firewall once, and
expect it to protect you forever. (See <a class="xref" href="ch12_01.htm" title="Maintaining Firewalls">Chapter 12, <cite class="chapter">Maintaining Firewalls</CITE
></A
>
for advice on keeping your firewall up to date.)</P
></DIV
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-19">1.4.2.4 A firewall can't protect against
viruses</A
></H4
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="CH01VIRUS"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="CH01COMPVIRUS"></A
>Firewalls can't keep <span class="acronym">PC</SPAN
>
and Macintosh viruses out of a network. Although many firewalls scan
all incoming traffic to determine whether it is allowed to pass
through to the internal network, the scanning is mostly for source and
destination addresses and port numbers, not for the details of the
data. Even with sophisticated packet filtering or proxying software,
virus protection in a firewall is not very practical. There are simply
too many types of viruses and too many ways a virus can hide within
data.</P
><p class="para">Detecting a virus in a random packet of data passing through a firewall
is very difficult; it requires:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Recognizing that the packet is part of a program</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Determining what the program should look like</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Determining that the change is because of a virus</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">Even the first of these is a challenge. Most firewalls are protecting
machines of multiple types with different executable formats. A
program may be a compiled executable or a script (e.g., a
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> shell script, or a HyperCard stack), and many
machines support multiple, compiled executable types. Furthermore, most
programs are packaged for transport, and are often compressed as
well. Packages being transferred via email or Usenet news will also
have been encoded into <span class="acronym">ASCII</SPAN
> in different ways.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-610"></A
>For all of these reasons, users may end up bringing viruses behind the
firewall, no matter how secure that firewall is. Even if you could do a
perfect job of blocking viruses at the firewall, however, you still
haven't addressed the virus problem. You've done nothing about
the far more common sources of viruses: software downloaded from dial-up
bulletin-board systems, software brought in on floppies from home or
other sites, and even software that comes pre-infected from
manufacturers are more common than virus-infected software on the
Internet. Whatever you do to address those threats will also address the
problem of software transferred through the firewall.</P
><p class="para">The most practical way to address the virus problem is through
host-based virus protection software, and user education concerning the
dangers of viruses and precautions to take against them. <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-614"></A

><a class="indexterm" name="CH01FWBUYVSBUILD"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="CH01DESIGNFW"></A
>Until recently, if a site wanted a firewall, they had little choice but
to design and build it themselves (perhaps with their own staff, or
perhaps by hiring a consultant or contractor). Over the last few years,
however, more and more commercial firewall offerings have reached the
market. These products continue to grow in number and functionality at
an astounding rate, and many sites may find that one of these
products suits their needs.</P
><p class="para">In deciding whether or not a particular commercial firewall product will
meet your needs, you have to understand what your needs are. Even if
you decide to buy a firewall, you still need to understand a fair bit
about how they're built and how they work in order to make an informed
purchasing decision. Many sites spend as much or more effort evaluating
commercial firewall products as they would building their own firewall. </P
><p class="para">We're not saying that nobody should buy a firewall, or that
everybody should build their own. Our point is merely that it's not
necessarily any easier to buy than it is to build; it all depends on
your particular situation, and what resources you have at your
disposal. Sites with money to spend but little staff time or expertise
available often find buying an attractive solution, while sites with
expertise and time but little money often find
building more attractive.</P
><p class="para">Just what expertise do you need to design and build your own firewall? 
Like everything else, it depends; it depends on what services you want
to provide, what platforms you're using, what your security concerns
are, and so on. To install most of the tools described in this book,
you need basic Internet skills to obtain the tools, and basic system
administration skills to configure, compile, and install them. If you
don't know what those skills are, you probably don't have them; you
can obtain them, but that's beyond the scope of this book.</P
><p class="para">Some people feel uncomfortable using software that's freely available on
the Internet, particularly for security-critical applications. We feel
that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. You may not have the
&quot;guarantees&quot; offered by vendors, but you have the ability to
inspect the source code and to share information with the large
community that helps to maintain the software. In practice, vendors come
and go, but the community endures. The packages we discuss in this
book are widely used; many of the largest sites on the Internet base
their firewalls on them. These packages reflect years of real-life
experience with the Internet and its risks.</P
><p class="para">Furthermore, while it's perfectly possible to build a firewall
consisting solely of freely available software, there's no reason to
feel that it's all or nothing; freely available tools provide a valuable
complement to purchased solutions. Buying a firewall shouldn't make you
reluctant to supplement with freely available tools, and building one
shouldn't make you reluctant to supplement with purchased tools. Don't
rule out a product just because it's commercial, or just because it's
freely available. Truly excellent products with great support appear
in both categories, as do poorly thought out products with no support.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-632"></A
