>To configure a packet filtering router, you first need to decide what
services you want to allow or deny, and then you need to translate
your decisions into rules about packets. In reality, you probably
don't care about the details of packets at all. What you want is to
get your work done. For example, you want to receive mail from the
Internet, and whether that's managed by packets or by Murphy's ghost
is irrelevant to you. The router, on the other hand, cares only about
packets, and only about very limited parts of them. In constructing
the rules for your routers, you have to translate the general
statement &quot;Receive mail from the Internet&quot; into a
description of the particular kinds of packets you want the router to
allow to pass.</P
><p class="para">The following sections outline the general concepts you need to keep
in mind when translating decisions about services into rules about
packets. The specific details for each service are described in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A
>.</P

Bidirectional</A

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4218"></A
>Protocols are usually bidirectional; they almost always involve one
side sending an inquiry or a command, and the other side sending a
response of some kind. When you're planning your packet filtering
rules, you need to remember that packets go both ways. For example, it
doesn't do any good to allow outbound Telnet packets that carry your
keystrokes to a remote host, if you don't also allow the incoming
packets for that connection that carry the screen display back to you.</P
><p class="para">Conversely, it also won't do you any good to block only half a
connection. Many attacks can be carried out if attackers can get
packets into your network, even if the attackers can't get any
responses back. This is possible because the responses may be
predictable enough to allow attackers to carry on their side of the
conversation without having to actually see the responses at all. If
the responses are predictable, an attacker doesn't need to see
them. They won't be able to extract any information directly if they
don't see the responses, but they may be able to do something that
gives them the data indirectly. For example, even if they can't see
your <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</EM
> file directly, they can probably
issue a command to mail themselves a copy.</P

>When you're planning your packet filtering strategy, you need to be
careful in your discussions of &quot;inbound&quot; versus
&quot;outbound.&quot; You need to carefully distinguish between
inbound and outbound <em class="emphasis">packets,</EM
> and inbound and
outbound <em class="emphasis">services</EM
>. An outbound service (e.g., the
Telnet service mentioned above) involves both outbound packets (your
keystrokes) and inbound packets (the responses to be displayed on your
screen). Although most people habitually think in terms of
<em class="emphasis">services</EM
>, you need to make sure you think in
terms of <em class="emphasis">packets</EM
> when you're dealing with packet
filtering. When you talk to others about filtering, be sure to
communicate clearly whether you're talking about inbound versus
outbound packets, or inbound versus outbound services.</P

>In <a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="Security Strategies">Chapter 3</A
>, we distingushed between the two
stances you can choose in putting together your security policy: the
default deny stance (that which is not expressly permitted is
prohibited) and the default permit stance (that which is not
explicitly prohibited is permitted). From a security point of view, it
is far safer to take the attitude that things should be denied by
default. Your packet filtering rules should reflect this stance. As
we discussed earlier, start from a position of denying everything and
then set rules that allow only protocols that you need, that you
understand the security implications of, and that you feel that you
can provide safely enough (according to your own particular definition
of &quot;safely enough&quot;) for your purposes</P
><p class="para">The default deny stance is much safer and more effective than the
default permit stance, which involves permitting everything by default
and trying to block those things that you know are problems. The
reality is that with such an approach, you'll never know about
all the problems, and thus you'll never be able to
do a complete job.</P
><p class="para">In practical terms, the default deny stance means that your filtering
rules should be a small list of specific things that you allow, perhaps
with a few very specific things you deny scattered throughout to make
the logic come out right, followed by a default deny that covers
everything else. We'll explain in detail how these rules work later in
this chapter.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4254"></A
