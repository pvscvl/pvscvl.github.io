architectures.  There is a good deal of flexibility in how you can
configure and combine firewall components to best suit your hardware,
your budget, and your security policy. This section describes some
common variations, and their benefits and drawbacks.</P

may make sense to use multiple bastion hosts in your firewall
configuration, as we show in <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-04-FIG-6" title="Architecture using two bastion hosts">Figure 4.6</A
>. Reasons
you might want to do this include performance, redundancy, and the
need to separate data or servers.</P
><h4 class="figure"><a class="title" name="FIRE-04-FIG-6">Figure 4.6: Architecture using two bastion hosts</A
></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire0406.gif" alt="Figure 4.6"><p class="para">You might decide to have one bastion host handle the services that are
important to your own users (such as <span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN
> servers,
proxy servers, and so on), while another host handles the services
that you provide to the Internet, but which your users don't care
about (for example, an anonymous <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> server). In
this way, performance for your own users won't be dragged down by the
activities of outside users.</P
><p class="para">You may have performance reasons to create multiple bastion hosts even
if you don't provide services to the Internet. Some services, like
Usenet news, are resource-intensive and easily
separated from others.  It's also possible to provide multiple bastion
hosts with the same services for performance reasons, but it can be
difficult to do load balancing. Most services need to be configured
for particular servers, so creating multiple hosts for individual
services works best if you can predict usage in advance.</P
><p class="para">How about redundancy? If your firewall configuration includes multiple
bastion hosts, you might configure them for redundancy, so that if one
fails, the services can be provided by another, but beware that only
some services support this approach. For example, you might configure
and designate multiple bastion hosts as <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> servers
for your domain (via <span class="acronym">DNS NS</SPAN
> [Name
Server] records, which specify the name servers for a domain), or as
<span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN
> servers (via <span class="acronym">DNS MX</SPAN
> [Mail Exchange] records, which specify what servers will
accept mail for a given host or domain), or both. Then, if one of the
bastion hosts is unavailable or overloaded, the <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
>
and <span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN
> activity will use the other as a fallback
system.</P
><p class="para">You might also use multiple bastion hosts to keep the data sets of
services from interfering with each other. In addition to the
performance issues discussed earlier, there may be security reasons
for this separation. For example, you might decide to
provide one <span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> server for use by your customers
over the Internet, and another for use by the general public. By
providing two servers, you can offer different data to customers and
possibly better performance, by using a less loaded or more powerful
machine.</P
><p class="para">You could also run your <span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> server and
your anonymous <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> server on separate machines, to
eliminate the possibility that one server could be used to compromise
the other. (For a discussion of of how this might be done, see the
description of <span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> server vulnerabilities in
<a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A

>You can merge the interior and exterior routers into a single
 router, but only if you have a router sufficiently capable
 and flexible.  In general, you need a router that allows you to
 specify both inbound and outbound filters on each interface. In <a class="xref" href="ch06_01.htm" title="Packet Filtering">Chapter 6</A
>, we discuss what this means, and we describe
 the packet filtering problems that may arise with routers that have
 more than two interfaces and don't have this capability.</P
><p class="para">If you merge the interior and exterior routers, as we show in <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-04-FIG-7" title="Architecture using a merged interior and exterior router">Figure 4.7</A
>, you'll still have a perimeter net (on one
interface of the router) and a connection to your internal net (on
another interface of the router). Some traffic would flow directly
between the internal net and the Internet (the traffic that is permitted
by the packet filtering rules set up for the router), and other traffic
would flow between the perimeter net and the Internet, or the perimeter
net and the internal net (the traffic that is handled by proxies).</P

vulnerable to the compromise of a single router. In general, routers are
easier to protect than hosts, but they are not impenetrable.</P

>There might be cases in which you use a single dual-homed machine as
both your bastion host and your exterior router. Here's an example:
suppose you only have a dial-up <span class="acronym">SLIP</SPAN
> or
<span class="acronym">PPP</SPAN
> connection to the Internet.  In this case, you
might run something like the Morning Star <span class="acronym">PPP</SPAN
>
package on your bastion host, and let it act as both bastion host and
exterior router. This is functionally equivalent to the three-machine
configuration (bastion host, interior router, exterior router)
described for the screened subnet architecture shown earlier in
this chapter.</P
><p class="para">Using a dual-homed host to route traffic won't give you the
performance or the flexibility of a dedicated router, but you don't
need much of either for a single low-bandwidth connection. Depending
on the operating system and software you're using, you may or may not
have the ability to do packet filtering. Several of the available
interface software packages, such as the Morning Star
<span class="acronym">PPP</SPAN
> package mentioned earlier, have quite good
packet filtering capabilities. However, because the exterior router
doesn't have to do much packet filtering anyway, using an interface
package that doesn't have good packet filtering capabilities is not
that big a problem.</P
><p class="para">Unlike merging the interior and exterior routers, merging the bastion
host with the exterior router, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-04-FIG-8" title="Architecture using a merged bastion host and exterior router">Figure 4.8</A
>, does not open significant new vulnerabilities.
It does expose the bastion host further. In this architecture, the
bastion host is more exposed to the Internet, protected only by whatever
filtering (if any) its own interface package does, and you will need to
take extra care to protect it. </P

>While it is acceptable to merge the bastion host and the exterior
router, as we discussed in the previous section, it's not a good idea
to merge the bastion host and the interior router, as we show in <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-04-FIG-9" title="Architecture using a merged bastion host and interior router">Figure 4.9</A
>. Doing so compromises your overall security.</P
><p class="para">The bastion host and the exterior router each perform distinct
protective tasks; they complement each other but don't back each
other up. The interior router functions in part as a backup to the two
of them.</P
><p class="para">If you merge the bastion host and the interior router, you've changed
the firewall configuration in a fundamental way. In the first case
(with a separate bastion host and interior router), you have a
screened subnet firewall architecture. With this type of
configuration, the perimeter net for the bastion host doesn't carry
any strictly internal traffic, so this traffic is protected from
snooping even if the bastion host is successfully penetrated; to get
at the internal network, the attacker still must get past the interior
router. In the second case (with a merged bastion host and interior
router), you have a screened host firewall architecture. With this
type of configuration, if the bastion host is broken into, there's
nothing left in the way of security between the bastion host and the
internal network.</P
><h4 class="figure"><a class="title" name="FIRE-04-FIG-9">Figure 4.9: Architecture using a merged bastion host and interior router</A
></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire0409.gif" alt="Figure 4.9"><p class="para">One of the main purposes of the perimeter network is to prevent the
bastion host from being able to snoop on internal traffic. Moving the
bastion host to the interior router makes all of your internal traffic
visible to it.</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="CH04INTROUTMULT"></A
>Using multiple
     interior routers to connect your perimeter net to multiple parts
     of your internal net can cause a lot of problems, and is
     generally a bad idea.</P
><p class="para">The basic problem is that the routing software on an internal system
could decide that the fastest way to another internal system is via the
perimeter net. If you're lucky, this approach simply won't work,
because it will be blocked by the packet filtering on one of the
routers. If you're unlucky, it will work, and you'll have sensitive,
strictly internal traffic flowing across your perimeter net, where it
can be snooped on if somebody has managed to break in to the bastion
host.</P
><p class="para">It's also difficult to keep multiple interior routers correctly
configured. The interior router is the one with the most important and
the most complex set of packet filters and having two of them doubles
your chances of getting the rule sets wrong.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2149"></A
>Nevertheless, you may still end up wanting to do this. On a large
internal network, having a single interior router may be both a
performance problem and a reliability problem. If you're trying to
provide redundancy, that single point of failure is a major annoyance.
In that case, the safest (and most redundant) thing to do is to set up
each interior router to a separate perimeter net and exterior router;
this configuration is discussed later in this chapter. This
configuration is more complex and more expensive, but it increases both
redundancy and performance, as well as making it highly unlikely that
traffic will try to go between the interior routers (if the Internet is
the shortest route between two parts of your internal network, you have
much worse problems than most sites) and extraordinarily unlikely that
it will succeed (four sets of packet filters are trying to keep it out).</P
><p class="para">If performance problems alone are motivating you to look at multiple
interior routers, it's hard to justify the expense of separate perimeter
networks and exterior routers. In most cases, however, the interior
router is not the performance bottleneck. If it is, then one of the
following cases is occurring:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">There is a lot of traffic going to the perimeter net that is not then
going to the external network.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Your exterior gateway is much faster than your interior gateway. </P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">In the first case, you have misconfigured something; the perimeter net
may take occasional traffic that isn't destined for the external world
in some configurations (for example, <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> queries
about external hosts when the information is cached), but that traffic
should never be significant. In the second case, you should seriously
consider upgrading the interior router to match the exterior router,
instead of adding a second one.</P

></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire0410.gif" alt="Figure 4.10"><p class="para">Another reason for having multiple interior routers is that you have
multiple internal networks, which have technical, organizational, or
political reasons not to share a single router. The simplest way to
accommodate these networks would be to give them separate interfaces
on a single router, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-04-FIG-11" title="Multiple internal networks (separate interfaces in a single router)">Figure 4.11</A
>. This
complicates the router configuration considerably (how considerably
depends a great deal on the router in question, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch06_01.htm" title="Packet Filtering">Chapter 6</A
>), but doesn't produce the risks of a multiple
interior router configuration. If there are too many networks for a
single router, or if sharing a router is unpalatable for other
reasons, consider making an internal backbone and connecting it to the
perimeter network with a single router, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-04-FIG-12" title="Multiple internal networks (backbone architecture)">Figure 4.12</A
>.</P

><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire0412.gif" alt="Figure 4.12"><p class="para">You may find that an effective way to accommodate different security
policies among different internal networks is to attach them to the
perimeter through separate routers, (e.g., one network wants to
allow connections that others consider insecure.) In this case, the
perimeter network should be the <em class="emphasis">only</EM
>
interconnection between the internal networks; there should be no
confidential traffic passing between them; and each internal network
should treat the other as an untrusted, external network. This
is likely to be extremely inconvenient for some users on each network,
but anything else will either compromise the security of the site as a
whole or remove the distinction that caused you to set up the two
routers in the first place.</P
><p class="para">If you decide that you are willing to accept the risks of having
multiple interior routers, you can minimize those risks by having all
the interior routers managed by the same group (so conflicting
security policies aren't being enforced). You should also keep a
careful watch for internal traffic crossing the perimeter network and
act promptly to cure the sources of it.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2178"></A

significant security problem. They may have different filter sets, but
that's not critical in exterior routers. There is twice the chance that
one will be compromisable, but a compromise of an exterior router is not
particularly threatening. </P
><p class="para">Things are more complex if the connections are to different places (for
example, one is to the Internet and one is to a site you're
collaborating with and need more bandwidth to). To figure out whether
such an architecture makes sense in these cases, ask yourself this
question: what traffic could someone see if they broke into a bastion
host on this perimeter net? For example, if an attacker broke in, could
he snoop on sensitive traffic between your site and a subsidiary or
affiliate? If so, then you may want to think about installing multiple
perimeter nets instead of multiple exterior routers on a single
perimeter net. (This case is shown in the next section.)</P

split the perimeter network and insert a dual-homed host. The routers
provide protection from forgery, and protect from failures where the
dual-homed host starts to route traffic. The dual-homed host provides
finer controls on the connections than packet filtering. This is a
belt-and-suspenders firewall, providing excellent multilayered
protection, although it requires careful configuration on the dual-homed
host to be sure you're taking full advantage of the possibilities.
