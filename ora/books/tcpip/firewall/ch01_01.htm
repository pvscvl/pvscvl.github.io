><p class="para">It is scarcely possible to enter a bookstore, read a magazine or a
newspaper, or listen to a news broadcast without seeing or hearing
something about the Internet in some guise. It's become so popular that
it no longer requires explanations when mentioned in nontechnical
publications, and it gets mentioned plenty, in magazines ranging from
<em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</EM
> to <em class="emphasis">Bead and
Button</EM
>. While nontechnical publications are obsessed with
the Internet, the technical publications have moved on and are obsessed
with security. It's a logical progression; once the first excitement of
having a superhighway in your neighborhood wears off, you're bound to
notice that not only does it let you travel, it lets a very large number
of strangers show up where you are, and not all of them are people you
would have invited. </P
><p class="para">Both views are true: The Internet is a marvelous technological advance
that provides access to information, and the ability to publish
information, in revolutionary ways. But it's also a major danger that
provides the ability to pollute and destroy information in revolutionary
ways. This book is about one way to balance the advantages and the
risks&nbsp;- to take part in the Internet while still protecting yourself. </P
><p class="para">Later in this chapter, we describe different models of
security people have used to protect their data and resources on
the Internet. Our emphasis in this book is on the network security
model and, in particular, the use of Internet firewalls. A firewall is
a form of protection that allows a network to connect to the Internet
while maintaining a degree of security. The section later in this
chapter called &quot;What is an Internet Firewall?&quot; describes the
basics of firewalls and summarize what they can&nbsp;- and cannot&nbsp;- do to
help make your site secure. Before we discuss what you can do with a
firewall, though, we want to describe briefly why you need one. What
are you protecting on your systems? What types of attacks and attackers
are we seeing today? What types of security can you use to protect your
site?</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="CH01FWWHATTO"></A
>A firewall is basically a protective device. If you are building a
firewall, the first thing you need to worry about is what you're trying
to protect. When you connect to the Internet, you're putting three
things at risk:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Your data: the information you keep on the computers</P

></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-224"></A
>Your data has three separate characteristics that need to be protected:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Secrecy:</EM
> you might not want other people to
know it.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Integrity:</EM
> you probably don't want other
people to change it.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Availability:</EM
> you almost certainly want to
be able to use it yourself.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">People tend to focus on the risks associated with secrecy, and it's true
that those are usually large risks. Many organizations have some of
their most important secrets&nbsp;- the designs for their products, their
financial records, or student records&nbsp;- on their computers. On the
other hand, you may find that at your site it is relatively easy to
separate the machines containing this kind of highly secret data from
the machines that connect to the Internet. </P
><p class="para">Suppose that you <em class="emphasis">can</EM
> separate your data in this
way, and that none of the information that is Internet accessible
is secret. In that case, why should
you worry about security? Because secrecy isn't the only thing you're
trying to protect. You still need to worry about integrity and
availability. After all, if your data isn't secret, and if you don't
mind its being changed, and if you don't care whether or not anybody can
get to it, why are you wasting disk space on it?</P
><p class="para">Even if your data isn't particularly secret, you'll suffer the
consequences if it's destroyed or modified. Some of these consequences
have readily calculable costs: if you lose data, you'll have to pay to
have it reconstructed; if you were planning to sell that data in some
form, you'll have lost sales regardless of whether the data is something
you sell directly, the designs you use to build things from, or the code
for a software product. There are also intangible costs associated with
any security incident. The most serious is the loss of confidence (user
confidence, customer confidence, investor confidence, staff confidence,
student confidence, public confidence) in your systems and data and,
consequently, a loss of confidence in your organization.  </P
><div class="sidebar"><h4 class="sidebar"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-240">Has Your Data Been Modified?</A

><p class="para">Security incidents are different from many other types of crimes
because detection is unusually difficult. Sometimes, it may take a
long time to find out that someone has broken into your
site. Sometimes, you'll never know. Even if somebody breaks in but
doesn't actually <em class="emphasis">do</EM
> anything to your system or
data, you'll probably lose time (hours or days) while you verify that
they didn't do anything.  In a lot of ways, a brute-force
trash-everything attack is a lot easier to deal with than a break-in
by somebody who doesn't appear to damage your system. If they trash
everything, you bite the bullet, restore from backups, and get on with
your life. But, if they don't appear to have done anything, you spend
a lot of time second-guessing yourself, trying to make
<em class="emphasis">sure</EM
> they haven't done anything to damage your
system or data. Although this book is about preventing security
incidents, <a class="xref" href="ch13_01.htm" title="Responding to Security Incidents">Chapter 13, <cite class="chapter">Responding to Security Incidents</CITE
></A
> supplies some general
guidelines for detecting, investigating, and recovering from security
incidents.</P

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-255"></A
>Even if you have data you don't care about&nbsp;- even if you
enjoy reinstalling your operating system every week because it exercises
the disks, or something like that&nbsp;- if other people are going to use
your computers, you probably would like to benefit from this use in some
way. Most people want to use their own computers, or they want to
charge other people for using them. Even people who give away computer
time and disk space usually expect to get good publicity and thanks for
it; they aren't going to get it from intruders. You spend good
time and money on your computing resources, and it is your right to
determine how they are used. </P
><p class="para">Intruders often argue that they are using only excess resources;
as a consequence, their intrusions don't cost their victims
anything. There are two problems with this argument. </P
><p class="para">First, it's impossible for an intruder to determine successfully what
resources are excess and use only those. It may look as if your
system has oceans of empty disk space and hours of unused computing
time; in fact, though, you might be just about to start 
computing animation sequences that are going to use every bit and
every microsecond. An intruder can't give back your resources when you
want them. (Along the same lines, I don't usually use my car between
midnight and 6 <span class="acronym">A.M.</SPAN
>, but that doesn't mean I'm
willing to lend it to you without being asked. What if I have an
early-morning flight the next day, or what if I'm called out to deal
with an emergency?)</P
><p class="para">Second, it's your right to use your resources the way you want to, even
if you merely feel some sort of Zen joy at the sight of empty disk
space, or if you like the way the blinky lights look when nothing's
happening on your computer. Computing resources are not natural
resources, nor are they limited resources that are wasted or destroyed
if they're not used. </P

>An intruder appears on the Internet with your identity. Anything
he does appears to come from you. What are the consequences?</P
><p class="para">Most of the time, the consequences are simply that other sites&nbsp;- or law
enforcement agencies&nbsp;- start calling you to ask why you're trying to
break into their systems. (This isn't as rare an occurrence as it may
seem. One site got serious about security when its system
administration staff added a line item to their time cards for
conversations with the <span class="acronym">FBI</SPAN
> about break-in attempts
originating from their site.)</P
><p class="para">Sometimes, such impostors cost you a lot more than lost time. An
intruder who actively dislikes you, or simply takes pleasure in making
life difficult for strangers, may send electronic mail or post news
messages that purport to come from you. Generally, people who choose to
do this aim for maximum hatefulness, rather than believability, but 
even if only a few people believe these messages, the cleanup can be
long and humiliating. Anything even remotely believable can do permanent
damage to your reputation.</P
><p class="para">A few years ago, an impostor posing as a Texas A&amp;M professor sent
out hate email containing racist comments to thousands of recipients.
The impostor was never found, and the professor is still dealing with
the repercussions of the forged messages. In another case, a student at
Dartmouth sent out email over the signature of a professor late one
night during exam period. Claiming a family emergency, the forged mail
canceled the next day's exam, and only a few students showed up.</P
><p class="para">It's possible to forge electronic mail or news without gaining access
to a site, but it's much easier to show that a message is a forgery if
it's generated from outside the forged site. The messages coming from
an intruder who has gained access to your site will look exactly like
yours because they <em class="emphasis">are </EM
>yours. An intruder will
also have access to all kinds of details that an external forger
won't. For example, an intruder has all of your mailing lists
available and knows exactly who you send mail to.</P
><p class="para">Even if an intruder doesn't use your identity, a break-in at your site
isn't good for your reputation. It shakes people's confidence in your
organization. In addition, most intruders will attempt to go from your
machines to others, which is going to make their next victims think of
your site as a platform for computer criminals. Many intruders will also
use compromised sites as distribution sites for pirated software and/or
pornography, which is not going to endear you to many folks either.
Whether or not it's your fault, having your name linked to other
intrusions, software piracy, and pornography is hard to recover from. <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-273"></A
