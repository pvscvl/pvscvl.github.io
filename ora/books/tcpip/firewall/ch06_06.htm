>The simplest, although not the most common, form of packet filtering is
filtering by address. Filtering in this way lets you restrict the flow
of packets based on the source and/or destination addresses of the
packets, without having to consider what protocols are involved. Such
filtering can be used to allow certain external hosts to talk to certain
internal hosts, for example, or to prevent an attacker from injecting
forged packets (packets handcrafted so they appear to come from
somewhere other than their true source) into your network.</P
><p class="para">For example, let's say that you want to block incoming packets with
forged source addresses; you would specify this rule: </P
><table class="informaltable"><thead class="thead"><tr class="row" valign="TOP"><th class="entry" align="LEFT" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rule</TH
><th class="entry" align="LEFT" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Direction</TH
><th class="entry" align="LEFT" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Source Address</TH
><th class="entry" align="LEFT" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Destination Address</TH
><th class="entry" align="LEFT" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Action</TH

><td class="entry" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Any</TD
><td class="entry" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Deny</TD
></TR
></TBODY
></TABLE
><p class="para">Note that Direction is relative to your internal
network. In the router between your internal network and the
Internet, you could apply an inbound rule either to
incoming packets on the Internet interface or to outgoing packets on
the internal interface; either way, you will achieve the same results
for the protected hosts. The difference is in what the router itself
sees. If you filter outgoing packets, the router is not protecting
itself.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-06-S2-15">6.6.1 Risks of Filtering by Source
Address</A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="CH06SOURCE"></A
>It's not necessarily safe to trust source addresses because source
addresses can be forged. Unless you use some kind of cryptographic
authentication between you and the host you want to talk to, you won't
know if you're really talking to that host, or to some other machine
that is pretending to be that host. The filters we've discussed above
will help you if an external host is claiming to be an internal host,
but they won't do anything about an external host claiming to be a
different external host.</P
><p class="para">There are two kinds of attacks that rely on forgery: <em class="emphasis">source
address</EM
> and <em class="emphasis">man in the middle</EM
>.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-5304"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-5307"></A
>In a basic <em class="emphasis">source address</EM
> forgery attack
(shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06_01.htm" title="Source address forgery">Figure 6.1</A
>), an
attacker sends you packets that claim to be from someone you trust in
some way, hoping to get you to take some action based on that trust,
without expecting to get any packets back from you. If the attacker
doesn't care about getting packets back from you, he doesn't need to be
on the path between you and whoever he is pretending to be; he can be
anywhere. </P
><p class="para">In fact, your responses will go to whomever the attacker is
pretending to be, not to the attacker. However,
if the attacker can predict your responses, he doesn't
need to see them. Many (if not most) protocols
are predictable enough for a skilled attacker to be successful at
this. There are plenty of attacks that can be carried out without the
attacker needing to see the results directly. For example, suppose an
attacker issues a command to your system that causes it to email your
password file to him; if your system is going to send the attacker the
password file in the mail, there is no need for him to see it during
the attack itself.</P
><p class="para">In many circumstances&nbsp;- particularly those involving
<span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
> connections&nbsp;- the real machine (that the
attacker is pretending to be) will react to your packets (packets that
are attempting to carry on a conversation it knows nothing about) by
trying to reset the bogus connection. Obviously, the attacker doesn't
want this to happen. He has to ensure the attack completes before the
real machine gets the packets you're sending, or before you get the
reset packets from the real machine. There are a number of ways to
ensure this&nbsp;- for example:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Carrying out the attack while the real machine is down</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Crashing the real machine so the attack can be carried out</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Flooding the real machine while the attack is carried out</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Confusing the routing between the real machine and the target </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Using an attack where only the first response packet is required,
so that the reset doesn't matter</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">Attacks of this kind used to be considered a theoretical problem with
little real-world effect, but they are now common enough to be
considered a serious threat. (In general, it's not a good idea to
dismiss theoretical attacks completely, because they eventually become
actual attacks. This kind of attack was known as a theoretical
possibility for many years before it actually occurred, and yet many
people didn't bother to protect against it. )</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-5328"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-5330"></A
>The <em class="emphasis">man in the middle</EM
> forgery attack depends on
being able to carry out a complete conversation while claiming to be
the trusted host. In order to do this, the attacking machine needs to
be able to not only send you packets, but also intercept the packets
you reply with. To do this, the attacker needs to do one of the
following:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Insinuate his attacking machine into the path between you and the real
machine. This is easiest to do near the ends of the path, and most
difficult to do somewhere in the middle, because given the nature of
modern <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> networks, the path through &quot;the
middle&quot; can change at any second.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Alter the path between the machines so it leads through his
attacking machine. This may be very easy or very difficult, depending
on the network topology and routing system used by your network, the
remote network, and the Internet service providers between those
networks.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">Although this kind of attack is called
&quot;man in the middle,&quot; it's relatively rare for it to
actually be carried out in the middle, external to the sites at each
end, because nobody but a network provider is in a position to carry
it out in that way, and network providers are rarely compromised to
that extent. (People who compromise network providers tend to be
working on quantity. Packet sniffing will give them many hosts
rapidly, but man in the middle attacks give them only one site at a
time.) These attacks tend to be problems only if one of the involved
sites has hostile users who have physical access to the network (for
example, this might be the case if one site is a university.)</P
><p class="para">So, who <em class="emphasis">can</EM
> you trust? At the extreme, nobody,
unless you trust the machines involved at both ends
and the path between them. If you trust the
machines but not the path, you can use encryption to give you a secure
connection over an insecure path. Unfortunately, as we discuss in
<a class="xref" href="ch10_01.htm" title="Authentication and Inbound Services">Chapter 10, <cite class="chapter">Authentication and Inbound
Services</CITE
></A
>, there
are no widespread and commonly available tools to do that yet, but
a number of sites are experimenting with ad hoc solutions, and
commercial solutions are beginning to appear. <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-5344"></A
