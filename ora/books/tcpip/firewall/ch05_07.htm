>If at all possible, don't allow any user accounts on the bastion host. 
Keeping such accounts off the bastion host will give you the best
security. There are several reasons why, including:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Vulnerabilities of the accounts themselves</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Vulnerabilities of the services required to support the accounts</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Reduced stability and reliability of the machine</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Inadvertent subversion of the bastion host's security by users</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Increased difficulty in detecting attacks</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">User accounts provide relatively easy avenues of attack for someone
who is intent on breaking into the bastion host. Each account usually
has a reusable password[3]
that can be attacked through a variety of means, including dictionary
searches, brute force searches, or capture by network eavesdropping.
Multiply this by many users, and you have a disaster in the making.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[3] We discuss ways to support nonreusable passwords in <a class="xref" href="ch10_01.htm" title="Authentication and Inbound Services">Chapter 10, <cite class="chapter">Authentication and Inbound
Services</CITE
></A
>.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Supporting user accounts in any useful fashion requires the bastion
host to enable services (for example, printing and local mail delivery
services) that could otherwise be disabled on the bastion host. Every
service that is available on the bastion host provides another avenue
of attack, through software bugs or configuration errors.</P
><p class="para">Having to support user accounts also can reduce the stability and
reliability of the machine itself. Machines that do not support user
accounts tend to run predictably and are stable. Many sites have found
that machines without users tend to run pretty much indefinitely (or
at least until the power fails) without crashing.</P
><p class="para">Users themselves can contribute to security problems on the bastion
host. They don't (usually) do it deliberately, but they can subvert the
system in a variety of ways. These range from trivial (e.g., choosing a
poor password) to complex (e.g., setting up an unauthorized information
server that has unknown security implications). Users are seldom trying
to be malicious; they're normally just trying to get their own jobs done
more efficiently and effectively.</P
><p class="para">It's usually easier to tell if everything is &quot;running
normally&quot; on a machine that doesn't have user accounts muddying
the waters. Users behave in unpredictable ways, but you want a bastion
host to have a predictable usage pattern, in order to detect
intrusions by watching for interruptions in the pattern. </P
><p class="para">If you need to allow user accounts on the bastion host, keep them to a
minimum. Add accounts individually, monitor them carefully, and
regularly verify that they're still needed. </P
