>There are a number of different real-time conferencing services
available on the Internet, including <em class="emphasis">talk</EM
>,
<span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
>, and the various services provided over the
Multicast Backbone (<span class="acronym">MBONE</SPAN
>). All of these services
provide a way for people to interact with other people, as opposed to
with databases or information archives. Electronic mail and Usenet news
are designed to facilitate asynchronous communications; they work even
if the participants aren't currently logged in. The next time they log
in, the email messages or news postings will be waiting for
them. Real-time conferencing services, on the other hand, are designed
for interactive use by on-line participants.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1083"></A
><em class="emphasis">talk</EM
> is the oldest real-time conferencing system
used on the Internet. It is available on most
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> machines and allows two people to hold a
conversation. A user initiates a <em class="emphasis">talk</EM
> session by
issuing the command &quot;talk other-user@host&quot;,
specifying the other user's address in basically the same way as their
email address. The other user gets a message on his screen that says
&quot;so-and-so is requesting a talk session&quot; and explaining
how to answer. When the contacted user answers (the equivalent of
picking up the phone when someone calls you),
<em class="emphasis">talk</EM
> finishes establishing the connection between
the caller and the contacted user; both users see a split screen,
where what they type appears in the top half of the screen, and what
the other user types appears in the bottom half.</P
><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">talk</EM
> is not widely used between strangers on the
Internet, although it is often used between colleagues or friends at
different sites (or even different parts of the same building). Some
people find it convenient, useful, or enjoyable to keep a window open
with a <em class="emphasis">talk</EM
> session to a colleague (or a friend)
while they work; it's less intrusive than a phone call, and allows you
to convey textual information&nbsp;- commands to be run, output from
commands cut-and-pasted for the other user to see, etc.&nbsp;- more
conveniently than over the phone. There aren't really any network
security implications for <em class="emphasis">talk </EM
>itself; the only
issue is that it can be very tricky to allow across a firewall without
unintentionally opening other security holes, as we describe in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A
>.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1095"></A
>Internet Relay Chat (<span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
>) is sort of like Citizens
Band (<span class="acronym">CB</SPAN
>) radio on the Internet; it has its own little
culture involving lots of people talking at each other. Users access
<span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> via dedicated <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> clients,
or by using Telnet to access a site that provides public
<span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> client service. <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> servers
provide hundreds (sometimes thousands) of named &quot;channels&quot;
for users to join. These channels come and go (anyone can create a new
channel, and a channel survives as long as there's anyone on it),
although some popular channels are more or less permanent. Unlike
<em class="emphasis">talk</EM
>, which is limited to a pair of users, any
number of people can participate on an <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> channel
simultaneously. Some <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> clients allow a user to
participate in multiple channels simultaneously (sort of like taking
part in two different conversations at once at a party).</P
><p class="para">There are a number of security problems with <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
>;
most of the problems aren't with the protocol itself, but with the
clients, and with who uses <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> and how. Many of the
clients allow servers far more access to local resources (files,
processes, programs, etc.) than is wise; a malicious server can wreak
havoc with a weak client. Further, many of the most frequent users of
<span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> are pranksters and crackers who use
<span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> to pass technical information among themselves,
and to try to trick other <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> users. Their idea of
a fine time is to tell some neophyte <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> user
&quot;Hey, give this command to your <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> client so
that I can show you this neat new toy I wrote.&quot; Then, when the
unsuspecting user follows the prankster's directions, the commands
trash the system. Anyone using <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> needs a good
client program and a healthy dose of wariness and suspicion.</P

>The Multicast Backbone (<span class="acronym">MBONE</SPAN
>) is the source of a
new set of services on the Internet, focusing on expanding real-time
conference services beyond text-based services like
<em class="emphasis">talk</EM
> and <span class="acronym">IRC</SPAN
> to include audio,
video, and electronic whiteboard. The <span class="acronym">MBONE</SPAN
> is
still in its infancy, but it is already used to send real-time video
of many technical conferences and programs over the Internet, e.g., Internet
Engineering Task Force meetings, keynote sessions from
<span class="acronym">USENIX</SPAN
> conferences, space shuttle flight
operations, and so on. At this point, the commonly
used <span class="acronym">MBONE</SPAN
> services appear to be reasonably secure.
Unintentional denial of service can be a real concern with the
<span class="acronym">MBONE</SPAN
>, however, because audio and video use so much 
memory. The methods used to distribute <span class="acronym">MBONE</SPAN
>
across the Internet also present some interesting risks, which are
discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A
