>Before we discuss the details of firewalls, it's important to
understand some of the basic strategies employed in building firewalls
and in enforcing security at your site. These are not staggering
revelations; they are straightforward approaches. They're presented
here so that you can keep them in mind as you put together a firewall
solution for your site.</P
><div class="sect1"><h2 class="sect1"><a class="title" name="FIRE-03-S1-1">3.1 Least Privilege</A
></H2
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="CH03LEAST"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="CH03ACCESSLEAST"></A
>Perhaps the most fundamental principle of security
(any kind of security, not just computer and
network security) is that of <em class="emphasis">least privilege</EM
>. 
Basically, the principle of least privilege means that any object (user,
administrator, program, system, whatever) should have only the
privileges the object needs to perform its assigned tasks&nbsp;- and no
more. Least privilege is an important principle for limiting your
exposure to attacks and for limiting the damage caused by particular
attacks. </P
><p class="para">Some car manufacturers set up their locks so that one key works the
doors and the ignition, and a different key works the glove compartment
and the trunk; that way, you can enforce least privilege by giving a
parking lot attendant the ability to park the car without the ability to
get at things stored in the trunk. Many people use splittable key
chains, for the same reason. You can enforce least privilege by giving
someone the key to your car, but not the key to your house as well.</P
><p class="para">In the Internet context, the examples are endless. Every user probably
doesn't need to access every Internet service. Every user
probably doesn't need to modify (or even read) every file on
your system. Every user probably doesn't need to know the machine's
root password. Every system administrator probably doesn't need to know
the root passwords for all systems. Every system probably doesn't need
to access every other system's files.</P
><p class="para">Applying the principle of least privilege suggests that you should
explore ways to reduce the privileges required for various operations. 
For example:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1397"></A
>Don't give a user the root password for a system if all she needs to
do is reset the print system. Instead, write a privileged program the
user can run that resets the print system.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Don't make a program run <em class="emphasis">setuid</EM
>
to root if all it needs to do is write to one protected file. Instead,
make the file group-writable to some group and make the program run
<em class="emphasis">setgid</EM
> to that group rather than
<em class="emphasis">setuid</EM
> to root.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1406"></A
>Don't have your internal systems trust one of your firewall
machines just so it can do backups. Instead, make the firewall machine
trust the internal system, or, better yet, put a local tape drive on the
firewall machine so that it can do its own backups.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1409"></A
> Many of the common
security problems on the Internet can be viewed as failures to follow
the principle of least privilege. For example, there have been and
continue to be any number of security problems discovered in Sendmail,
which is a big, complex program; any such program is going to have
bugs in it. The problem is that Sendmail runs (at least some of the
time) <em class="emphasis">setuid</EM
> to root; many of the attacks against
Sendmail take advantage of this. Because it runs as root, Sendmail is
a high-value target that gets a lot of attention from attackers; the
fact that it's a complex program just makes their jobs easier. This
implies both that privileged programs should be as simple as possible
and that, if a complex program requires privileges, you should look
for ways to separate and isolate the pieces that need privileges from
the complex parts.[1]</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[1] It's important to realize that Sendmail is far
from the only example we could cite; you can find similar problems in
almost any large, complex, privileged piece of software.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Many of the solutions you'll employ in protecting your site are
tactics for enforcing the strategy of least privilege. For example, a
packet filtering system is designed to allow in packets for the
services you want. Running insecure programs in an environment where
only the privileges the programs absolutely need are available to them
(e.g., a machine that's been stripped down in one way or another) is
another example; this is the essence of a bastion host.</P
><p class="para">There are two problems with trying to enforce least privilege. First,
it can be complex to implement when it isn't already a design feature of
the programs and protocols you're using. Trying to add it on may be very
difficult to get right. Some of the cars that try to implement least
privilege with separate keys for the trunk and the ignition have remote
trunk release buttons that are accessible without the keys, or fold-down
rear seats that allow you to access the trunk without opening it the
traditional way at all. You need to be very careful to be sure that
you've actually succeeded in implementing least privilege.</P
><p class="para">Second, you may end up implementing something less than least privilege.
Some cars have the gas cap release in the glove compartment. That's
intended to keep parking lot attendants from siphoning off your gas, but
if you lend a friend your car, you probably want them to be able to fill
it up with gas. If you give your friend only the ignition key, you're
giving them less than the minimum privilege you want them to have
(because they won't be able to fill up the gas tank), but adding the key
to the trunk and the glove compartment may give them more privilege than
you want them to have.</P
><p class="para">You may find similar effects with computer implementations of least
privilege. Trying to enforce least privilege on people, rather than
programs, can be particularly dangerous. You can predict fairly well
what permissions Sendmail is going to need to do its job; human beings
are less predictable, and more likely to become annoyed and dangerous if
they can't do what they want to. Be very careful to avoid turning your
users into your enemies.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1418"></A
