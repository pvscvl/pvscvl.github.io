>Packet filtering is a network security mechanism that works by
controlling what data can flow to and from a network. We provide a
very brief introduction to high-level <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> networking
concepts (a necessity for understanding packet filtering)
here, but if you're not already familiar with the topic, then
before continuing, you should refer to <a class="xref" href="appc_01.htm" title="TCP/IP Fundamentals">Appendix C, <cite class="appendix"><span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN
> Fundamentals</CITE
></A
> for
a more detailed discussion.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4039"></A
>To transfer information across a network, the information has to be
broken up into small pieces, each of which is sent
separately. Breaking the information into pieces allows many systems
to share the network, each sending pieces in turn. In
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> networking, those small pieces of data are
called <em class="emphasis">packets</EM
>. All data transfer across 
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> networks happens in the form of packets.</P

>The basic device that interconnects <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN

called a <em class="emphasis">router</EM
>. A router may be a dedicated
piece of hardware that has no other purpose, or it may be a piece of
software that runs on a general-purpose <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> or
<span class="acronym">PC</SPAN
> (<span class="acronym">MS-DOS</SPAN
>, Windows, Macintosh,
or other) system. Packets traversing an internetwork (a network of
networks) travel from router to router until they reach their
destination. The Internet itself is sort of the granddaddy of
internetworks&nbsp;- the ultimate &quot;network of networks.&quot;</P
><p class="para">A router has to make a routing decision about each packet it receives;
it has to decide how to send that packet on towards its ultimate
destination. In general, a packet carries no information to help the
router in this decision, other than the <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> address
of the packet's ultimate destination. The packet tells the router
where it wants to go, but not how to get there. Routers communicate
with each other using &quot;routing protocols&quot; such as the Routing
Information Protocol (<span class="acronym">RIP</SPAN
>) and Open Shortest Path
First (<span class="acronym">OSPF</SPAN
>) to build <em class="emphasis">routing
tables</EM
> in memory to determine how to get the packets to
their destinations. When routing a packet, a router compares the
packet's destination address to entries in the routing table and sends
the packet onward as directed by the routing table. Often, there won't
be a specific route for a particular destination, and the router will
use a &quot;default route;&quot; generally, such a route directs the
packet towards smarter or better-connected routers. (The default
routes at most sites point towards the Internet.)</P
><p class="para">In determining how to forward a packet towards its destination, a
normal router looks only at a normal packet's destination address and
asks only &quot;<em class="emphasis">How</EM
> can I forward this
packet?&quot; A packet filtering router also considers the question
&quot;<em class="emphasis">Should</EM
> I forward this packet?&quot; The
packet filtering router answers that question according to the
security policy programmed into the router via the packet filtering
rules.</P

to reach their destination, using the &quot;source route&quot;

></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">because &quot;file&quot; also isn't something the packet filtering

><p class="para">The main advantage of packet filtering is leverage: it allows you to
provide, in a single place, particular protections for an entire
network. Consider the Telnet service as an example. If you disallow
Telnet by turning off the Telnet server on all your hosts, you still
have to worry about someone in your organization installing a new
machine (or reinstalling an old one) with the Telnet server turned on.
On the other hand, if Telnet is not allowed by your filtering router,
such a new machine would be protected right from the start, regardless
of whether or not its Telnet server was actually running. This is an
example of the kind of &quot;fail safe&quot; stance we discussed in
<a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="Security Strategies">Chapter 3, <cite class="chapter">Security Strategies</CITE

>Routers also present a useful choke point (also discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="Security Strategies">Chapter 3</A
>) for all of the traffic entering or leaving a
network. Even if you have multiple routers for redundancy, you
probably have far fewer routers, under much tighter control, than you
have host machines.</P
><p class="para">Certain protections can be provided <em class="emphasis">only</EM
> by
filtering routers, and then only if they are deployed in particular
locations in your network. For example, it's a good idea to reject all
packets that have internal source addresses&nbsp;- that is, packets that
claim to be coming from internal machines but that are actually coming
in from the outside&nbsp;- because such packets are usually part of
address-spoofing attacks. In such attacks, an attacker is pretending
to be coming from an internal machine. Decision-making of this kind
can be done only in a filtering router at the perimeter of your
network. Only a filtering router in that location (which is, by
definition, the boundary between &quot;inside&quot; and
&quot;outside&quot;) is able to recognize such a packet, by looking
at the source address and whether the packet came from the inside (the
internal network connection) or the outside (the external network
connection).

><p class="para">One of the key advantages of packet filtering is that a single,
strategically placed packet filtering router can help protect an
entire network. If there is only one router 
that connects your site to
the Internet, you gain tremendous leverage on network security,

router.</P

>Unlike proxying, described in <a class="xref" href="ch07_01.htm" title="Proxy Systems">Chapter 7, <cite class="chapter">Proxy Systems</CITE

>, packet
filtering doesn't require any custom software or configuration of
client machines, nor does it require any special training or
procedures for users. When a packet filtering router decides to let a
packet through, the router is indistinguishable from a normal
router. Ideally, users won't even realize it's there, unless they try
to do something that is prohibited (presumably because it is a
security problem) by the packet filtering router's filtering policy.</P
><p class="para">This &quot;transparency&quot; means that packet filtering can be
done without the cooperation, and often without the knowledge, of
users. The point is not that you can do this subversively, behind
your users' backs (while actions like that are sometimes necessary&nbsp;- it
all depends on the circumstances&nbsp;- they can be highly political). The
point is that you can do packet filtering without their having to
learn anything new to make it work, and without your having to depend
on them to do (or not do) anything to make it work.</P

application; when you enforce restrictions on higher-level protocols,
you do it by port number, hoping that nothing else is running on the
