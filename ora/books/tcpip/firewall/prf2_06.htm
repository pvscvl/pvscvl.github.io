><p class="para">When we set out to write this book, we had no idea that it would
consume so much time and energy. We would never have succeeded without
the help of many people.</P
><p class="para">Special thanks to Ed DeHart and Craig Hunt. Ed worked with Brent in
the early stages of this book and wrote the foreword to it; we
appreciate all that he has done to help. <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN
> is
essential for understanding the basics of firewall construction, and
Craig Hunt, author of <em class="emphasis"><span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN
> Network
Administration</EM
> has kindly let us excerpt much of that
book's Chapters 1 and 2 in this book's <a class="xref" href="appc_01.htm" title="TCP/IP Fundamentals">Appendix C</A
> so
readers who do not already have a <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN
> background
can get a jump start.</P
><p class="para">Thanks to all those who reviewed drafts of the book before publication
and made helpful suggestions: Fred Avolio, Steve Bellovin, Niels
Bjergstrom, Rik Farrow, Simson Garfinkel, Eliot Lear, Evi Nemeth,
Steve Simmons, Steve Romig, Gene Spafford, Phil Trubey, and Mark
Verber. Thanks as well to Eric Allman for answering many Sendmail
questions and Paul Traina for answering many Cisco questions.</P
><p class="para">Thanks to all the people at O'Reilly &amp; Associates who turned this
manuscript into a finished book: to Mary Anne Weeks Mayo, the
wonderful and patient project manager/copyeditor for the book;
Len Muellner, Ellen Siever, and Norm Walsh who converted the book from
Word to <span class="acronym">SGML</SPAN
> and contributed their tool-tweaking
prowess; Chris Reilley who created the many excellent diagrams; Edie
Freedman who designed the cover and Nancy Priest who designed the
interior layout; John Files and Juliette Muellner who assisted with
production; Seth Maislin who prepared the index; and Sheryl Avruch and
Kismet McDonough-Chan who did the final quality control on the book.</P
><p class="para">Brent says: I would like to extend personal thanks to my friends and
family, for keeping me going for a year and a half while I worked on
the book; to my staff at Great Circle Associates, for keeping my
business going; to the many hundreds of folks who've attended my
Internet Security Firewalls Tutorial, for providing the impetus for
this whole endeavor (and for keeping my bills paid!); and to the many
thousands of subscribers to the Firewalls mailing list on the
Internet, for providing a stimulating environment to develop many of
the ideas found in this book. I also owe a lot of thanks to Debby
Russell, our editor at O'Reilly &amp; Associates, for all her help and
guidance, and to our technical reviewers, for all their wonderful
comments and suggestions.  Most of all, though, I'd like to thank my
very good friend and coauthor, Elizabeth Zwicky, without whose
collaboration and encouragement this book probably never would have
been finished, and certainly wouldn't have been as good.</P
><p class="para">Elizabeth says: My thanks go to my friends, my family, and my colleagues
at Silicon Graphics, for an almost infinite patience with my tendency to
alternate between obsessing about the book and refusing to discuss
anything even tangentially related to it. I'd like to particularly thank
Arnold Zwicky, Diana Smetters, Greg Rose, Eliot Lear, and Jeanne
Dusseault for their expert moral support (often during similar crises of
their own). But the most thanks for this effort have to go to Debby and
Brent, for giving me a chance to be part of an unexpected but extremely
rewarding project. </P
