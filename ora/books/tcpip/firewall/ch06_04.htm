in the packet filtering configuration, the router will forward the
packet on towards its destination, just as a normal router (not a packet
filtering router) would do. </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Drop the packet. The other obvious action to take is to drop the
packet if it fails the criteria in the packet filtering configuration.</P

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-5059"></A
>Regardless of whether the packet is forwarded or dropped
(&quot;permitted&quot; or &quot;denied&quot; in some packet
filtering implementations), you might want the router to log the
action that has been taken. This is especially true if you drop the
packet because it runs afoul of your packet filtering rules. In this
case, you'd like to know what's being tried that isn't allowed.</P
><p class="para">You probably aren't going to log every packet that is allowed, but you
might want to log some of these packets. For example, you might want
to log start-of-connection <span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
> packets, so that you
can keep track of incoming and outgoing <span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
>
connections. Not all packet filters will log allowed packets.</P
><p class="para">Different packet filtering implementations support different forms of
logging. Some will log only specific information about a packet, and
others will forward or log an entire dropped packet. Generally, your
packet filter will need to be configured to log to a host somewhere
via the <em class="emphasis">syslog</EM
> service. You don't want the only
copy of the logs to be on the packet filter if it is compromised. Most
packet filtering also occurs on dedicated routers, which rarely have
large amounts of disk space to dedicate to logging. See the discussion
of setting up logging in <a class="xref" href="ch05_01.htm" title="Bastion Hosts">Chapter 5, <cite class="chapter">Bastion Hosts</CITE

the sending machine not to retry sending the packet; thereby saving
some network traffic and some time for the user on the remote

></UL
><p class="para"><span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
>'s designers intended the first pair of
<span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error codes that the router might return,
&quot;host unreachable&quot; or &quot;network unreachable&quot;,
to indicate serious network problems: the destination host is
down or something in the only path to the host is down. These
error codes predate firewalls and packet filtering. The problem with
returning one of these error codes is that some hosts (particularly if
they're running older versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>) take them
quite literally. If these machines get back a &quot;host
unreachable&quot; for a given host, they will assume that the host is
totally unreachable and will close all currently
open connections to it, even if the other connections were permitted
by the packet filtering.</P
><p class="para">The second set of <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error codes the router might
return, &quot;host administratively unreachable&quot; and &quot;network
administratively unreachable&quot;, were added to the official list
of <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> message types a few years ago, specifically
to give packet filtering systems something to return when they dropped
a packet. Many systems do not yet recognize these codes, although that
should not cause your system problems. Systems are supposed to simply
ignore <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error codes they don't understand, so
this should be equivalent to returning no error code to such
systems. On the other hand, many devices comply poorly with standards,
and this is the kind of boundary condition some of them may not handle
gracefully. The fact that the standard requires a system to ignore
unknown error codes does not ensure that a system will not, in fact,
react fatally to such an error code. It simply ensures that you will
be able to argue persuasively that it is not your fault if they do so!</P
><p class="para">There are several issues to consider when you are deciding whether or
not your packet filtering system should return <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
>
error codes.</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Which message should you send?</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Can you afford the overhead of generating and returning error
codes?</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Will returning these codes enable attackers to get too much
information about your packet filtering?</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">Which set of error codes makes sense for your site? </P
><p class="para">Returning the old &quot;host unreachable&quot; and 
&quot;network unreachable&quot; codes is
technically incorrect (remember that the host may or may not be
unreachable, according to the packet filtering policy, depending on
what host is attempting to access what service). Also, these error
codes can cause many systems to react excessively (shutting down all
connections to that host or network).</P
><p class="para">Returning the new &quot;host administratively unreachable&quot; 
or &quot;network
administratively unreachable&quot; codes advertises the fact that there is a
packet filtering system at your site, which you may or may not want to
do. These codes may also cause excessive reactions in faulty
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> implementations.</P
><p class="para">There is another consideration as well. Generating and returning
<span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error codes takes a certain small amount of
effort on the part of the packet filtering router. An attacker could
conceivably mount a denial of service attack by flooding the router
with packets the router would reject, and for which it would try to
generate <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error packets. The issue isn't
network bandwidth; it's CPU load on the router. (While it's busy
generating <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> packets, it's not able to do other
things as quickly, like make filtering decisions.) On the other hand,
not returning <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error codes will cause a small
amount of excess network traffic, as the sending system tries and
retries to send the packet being dropped. This traffic shouldn't
amount to much, because the number of packets blocked by a packet
filtering system should be a fraction of the total number of packets
processed. (If it's not a small fraction, you've got more serious
problems, because people are apparently trying lots of things that
&quot;aren't allowed.&quot;)
 </P
><p class="para">If your router returns an <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error code for every
packet that violates your filtering policy, you're also giving an
attacker a way to probe your filtering system. By observing which
packets evoke an <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error response, attackers can
discover what types of packets do and don't violate your policy (and
thus what types of packets are and are not allowed into your
network). You should not give this information away, because it
greatly simplifies the attacker's job. The attacker knows that packets
that don't get the <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error are going somewhere,
and can concentrate on those protocols, where you actually have
vulnerabilities. You'd rather that the attacker spent plenty of time
sending you packets that you happily throw away. Returning
<span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error codes speeds up attack programs; if they
get back an <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error for something they try, they
don't have to wait for a timeout.</P
><p class="para">All in all, the safest thing to do seems to be to drop packets without
returning any <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error codes. If your router
offers enough flexibility, it might make sense to configure it to
return <span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> error codes to internal systems (which
would like to know immediately that something is going to fail, rather
than wait for a timeout), but not to external systems (where the
information would give an attacker a means to probe the filtering
configuration of the firewall). Even if your router doesn't seem to
offer such flexibility, you may be able to accomplish the same result
by specifying packet filtering rules to allow the relevant inbound
<span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> packets and disallow the relevant outbound
<span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> packets.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-5137"></A
