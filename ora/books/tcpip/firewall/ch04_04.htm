>The assumption in most of the discussions in this book is that you are
building a firewall to protect your internal network from the Internet. 
However, in some situations, you may also be protecting parts of your
internal network from other parts. There are a number of reasons why you
might want to do this:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">You have test or lab networks with strange things going on
there.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">You have networks that are less secure than the rest of
your site, e.g., demonstration or teaching networks where
outsiders are commonly present.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">You have networks that are more secure than the rest of
your site, e.g., secret development projects or networks where
financial data or grades are passed around.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">This is another situation where firewalls are a useful technology. In
some cases, you will want to build <em class="emphasis">internal
firewalls</EM
>; that is, firewalls that sit between two parts of
the same organization, or between two separate organizations that share
a network, rather than between a single organization and the Internet. </P
><p class="para">It often makes sense to keep one part of your organization separate from
another. Not everyone in an organization needs the same services or
information, and security is frequently more important in some
parts of an organization (the accounting department, for example) than
in others.</P
><p class="para">Many of the same tools and techniques you use to build Internet
firewalls are also useful for building these internal firewalls. 
However, there are some special considerations that you will need to
keep in mind if you are building an internal firewall.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-04-S2-15">4.4.1 Laboratory Networks</A
></H3

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2268"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2271"></A
>Laboratory and test networks are often the first networks that people
consider separating from the rest of an organization via a firewall
(usually as the result of some horrible experience where something
escapes the laboratory and runs amok). Unless people are working on
routers, this type of firewall can be quite simple. Neither a
perimeter net nor a bastion host is needed, because there is no worry
about snooping (all users are internal anyway), and you don't need to
provide many services (the machines are not people's home
machines). In most cases, you'll want a packet filtering router that
allows any connection inbound to the test network, but only known safe
connections from it. (What's safe will depend on what the test network
is playing with, rather than on the normal security considerations.)</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2274"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2277"></A
>In a few cases (for example, if you are testing bandwidth on the
network), you may want to protect the test network from outside traffic
that would invalidate tests, in which case you'll deny inbound
connections and allow outbound connections.</P
><p class="para">If you are testing routers, it's probably wisest to use an entirely
disconnected network; if you don't do this, then at least prevent the
firewall router from listening to routing updates from the test network.
You can do this a number of ways, depending on your network setup, what
you're testing, and what routers you have available. You might do any of
the following:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Use a different routing protocol from the one under test and
entirely disable the protocol under test.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Tell the router not to accept any routing updates from the
interface under test and to filter out packets in the routing protocol.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Specify which hosts the router will accept updates from.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">If you have a number of test networks, you may find it best to set up a
perimeter net for them and give each one a separate router onto the
perimeter net, putting most of the packet filtering in the router
between the perimeter and the main network. That way, if one test
network crashes its router, the rest still have their normal
connectivity. <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-04-FIG-15" title="Firewall architecture with a laboratory network">Figure 4.15</A
> shows this architecture.</P

></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire0415.gif" alt="Figure 4.15"><p class="para">If your testing involves external connections, the test network has to
be treated as an external network itself; see &quot;Joint Venture
Firewalls&quot; below.</P

></H3

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2300"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2302"></A
>Test networks are dangerous, but not necessarily less secure than
other networks. Many organizations also have some networks that are
intrinsically less secure than most. For example, a university may
consider networks that run through student dormitories to be
particularly insecure; a company may consider demonstration networks,
porting labs, and customer training networks to be particularly
insecure. Nevertheless, these insecure networks need more interaction
with the rest of the organization than does a purely external network.</P
><p class="para">Networks like dormitory networks and porting labs, where external
people have prolonged access and the ability to bring in their own
tools, are really as insecure as completely external networks and
should be treated that way. Either position them as a second external
connection (a new connection on your exterior router or a new exterior
router) or set up a separate perimeter network for them. The only
advantage these networks offer over purely external networks is that
you can specify particular software to be run on them, which means you
can make use of encryption effectively. (See <a class="xref" href="ch10_01.htm" title="Authentication and Inbound Services">Chapter 10, <cite class="chapter">Authentication and Inbound
Services</CITE
></A
> for a discussion of how to provide services to
external, untrusted networks.)</P
><p class="para">Demonstration and training labs, where external people have relatively
brief, supervised access and cannot bring in tools, can be more
trusted (as long as you are sure that people really do have
relatively brief, supervised access and cannot bring in tools!). You
still need to use a packet filtering router or a dual-homed
host to prevent confidential traffic from flowing across those
networks. You will also want to limit those networks to connections to
servers you consider secure. However, you may be willing to provide
NFS service from particular servers, for example, which you wouldn't
do to a purely untrusted network. One of your main concerns should be
preventing your trusted users from doing unsafe things while working
on those networks (for example, logging in to the machines on their
desks and forgetting to log out again, or reading confidential
electronic mail). This should be done with a combination of training
and force (ensuring that the most insecure uses fail).</P
><p class="para">This is a place where a dual-homed host can be quite useful, even with
no proxies on it; the number of people who need to use the host is
probably small, and having to log into it will ensure that they see
warning messages. The host will also be unable to provide some tempting
but highly insecure services; for example, you won't be able to run NFS
except from the dual-homed host, and people won't be able to mount their
home machine's filesystems.</P

></H3
><p class="para">Just as most organizations have points where they're particularly
insecure, most of them have points where they're particularly
security-conscious. At universities, these may be particular research
projects, or the registrar's office; at commercial companies, these may
be new products under development; at almost any place, the accounting
and finance machines need extra protection. Some unclassified government
work also requires extra protections. </P
><p class="para">Networks for doing classified work&nbsp;- at any level of
classification&nbsp;- not only need to be more secure, but also need to meet
all relevant government regulations. Generally speaking, they will
have to be separated from unclassified networks. In any
case, they are outside of the scope of this book. If you need to set
one up, consult your security officer; traditional firewalls will not
meet the requirements.[5] </P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[5] If you don't have a security officer, you're not going to have a
classified network, either.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">You can choose to meet your requirements for extra security either by
encrypting traffic that passes over your regular internal
networks, or by setting up separate networks for the secure
traffic. Separate networks are technically easier as long as there
are separate machines on them. That is, if you have a secure research
project that owns particular computers, and if people log into them
to work on that project, it's reasonably simple to set up a
straightforward single-machine firewall (a packet filtering router,
most likely). That firewall will treat your normal network as the
insecure external universe. Because the lab machines probably don't
need many services, a bastion host is unnecessary, and a
perimeter net is needed only for the most secret ventures.</P
><p class="para">If you are dealing with people whose day-to-day work is secure, and who
don't have separate machines for that work, a separate network becomes
harder to implement. If you put their machines onto a more
secure network, they can't work easily with everybody else at
the site, and they need a number of services. In this case, you'll need
a full bastion host, and therefore probably a perimeter net to put it
on. It's tempting to connect their machines to <em class="emphasis">two</EM
>
networks, the secure net and the insecure net, so they can transmit
confidential data over one and participate with the rest of the site on
the other, but this is a configuration nightmare. If they're attached to
both at once, each host is basically a dual-homed host firewall, with
all the attendant maintenance problems. If they can only be attached to
one at a time, things are more secure. However, configuring the machines
is unpleasant for you, and moving back and forth is unpleasant for the user.</P
><p class="para">At a university, which tends not to have a single coherent network to
start with, putting the registrar's office and the financial people on
secure networks, firewalled from the rest of the university, will
probably work. At a company or government office, where most people work
in the same environment, look into using encryption in your applications
instead.</P

>Sometimes, organizations come together for certain limited reasons,
such as a joint project; they need to be able to share machines, data,
and other resources for the duration of the project. For example, look
at the decision of <span class="acronym">IBM</SPAN
> and Apple to collaborate on
the Power<span class="acronym">PC</SPAN
>, a personal computer that runs a
common operating system; undertaking one joint project
doesn't mean that <span class="acronym">IBM</SPAN
> and Apple have decided to
merge their organizations or to open up all their operations to each
other.</P
><p class="para">Although the two parties have decided to trust each other for the
purposes of this project, they are still competitors. They want to
protect most of their systems and information from each other. It isn't
just that they may distrust each other; it's also that they can't be
sure how good the other's security is. They don't want to risk that an
intruder into their partner's system might, through this joint venture,
find a route into their system as well. This security problem occurs
even if the collaborators aren't also competitors. </P
><p class="para">You may also want to connect to an external company because it is an
outside vendor to you. A number of services depend on information
transfer, from shipping (you tell them what you want to ship; they
tell you what happened to your shipment) to architecture (you give
them specifications; they give you designs) to chip fabrication (you
send them the chip design, they give you status on the fabrication
process).  These outside vendors are not competitors in any sense,
but they frequently also work for competitors of yours. They are
probably aware of confidentiality issues and try to
protect the information they are supposed to have, to the best of
their ability. On the other hand, if there are routing slip-ups, and
data you're not explicitly sending to them crosses their networks,
they are probably going to be completely unconscious of it, and the
data will be at risk.</P
><p class="para">This may seem far-fetched, but it turns out to be a fairly routine
occurrence. One company was mystified to discover routes on its network
for a competitor's internal network, and still more baffled to
discover traffic using these routes. It turned out that the shortest
route between them and their competitor was through a common outside
vendor.  The traffic was not confidential, because it was all traffic
that would have gone through the Internet. On the other hand, the
connection to the outside vendor was not treated as if it were an
Internet connection (the outside vendor itself was not
Internet-connected, and nobody had considered the possibility of it
cross-connecting Internet-connected clients). Both companies had
sudden, unexpected, and unprotected vulnerabilities.</P
><p class="para">An internal firewall limits exposure in such a situation. It provides
a mechanism for sharing some resources, while protecting most of them.
Before you set out to build an internal firewall, be sure you're clear
on what you want to share, protect, and accomplish. Ask these
questions:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">What exactly do you want to accomplish by linking your network with
some other organization's network? The answer to this question will
determine what services you need to provide (and, by implication, what
services should be blocked).</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Are you just looking to exchange email or files with the other
organization privately, without having to communicate over the
Internet?  If that's all you want, then maybe a dial-up
<span class="acronym">UUCP</SPAN
> connection is all you need, not an
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>-level connection between your nets.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Are you trying to create a full work environment for a joint project
in which team members from both organizations can work together and
yet still have access to their own &quot;home&quot; systems (which
need to be protected from the other organization)? In such a case, you
might actually need two firewalls: one between the joint project net
and each of the home organizations.</P

to accomplish, and what your security concerns are, will determine

an `Arms-length' Relationship</A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2351"></A
>Shared perimeter networks are a good way to approach joint networks. Each
party can install its own router, under its own control, onto a
perimeter net between the two organizations. In some configurations,
these two routers might be the only machines on the perimeter net,
with no bastion host. If this is the case, then the &quot;net&quot;
might simply be a high-speed serial line (e.g., a 56 Kb/s or
T1/E1 line) between the two routers, rather than an Ethernet or
another type of local area network.</P
><p class="para">This is highly desirable with an outside vendor. Most of them are not
networking wizards, and they may attempt to economize by connecting
multiple clients to the same perimeter network. If the perimeter net is
an Ethernet or something similar, any client that can get to its
router on that perimeter network can see the traffic for all the clients
on that perimeter network&nbsp;- which, with some providers, is almost
guaranteed to be confidential information belonging to a competitor.
Using a point-to-point connection as the &quot;perimeter net&quot;
between the outside vendor and each client, rather than a shared
multiclient perimeter net, will prevent them from doing this, even
accidentally. </P

>You might not actually need to place a bastion host on the perimeter
network between two organizations. The decision about whether you need
a bastion host depends on what services are required for your
firewall and how much each organization trusts the other. Bastion
hosts on the perimeter net are rarely required for relationships with
outside vendors; usually you are sending data over one particular
protocol and can adequately protect that as a screened host.</P
><p class="para">If the organizations have a reasonable amount of trust in each other
(and, by extension, in each other's security), it may be
reasonable to establish the packet filters so that clients on the
other side can connect to internal servers (such as

host, and finally to the other party's internal systems.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2373"></A
