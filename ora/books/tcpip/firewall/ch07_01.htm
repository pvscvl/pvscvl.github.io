>Proxying provides Internet access to a single host, or a very
small number of hosts, while appearing to provide access to all of your
hosts. The hosts that have access act as proxies for the machines that
don't, doing what these machines want done. </P
><p class="para">A proxy server for a particular protocol or set of protocols runs on a
dual-homed host or a bastion host: some host that the user can talk
to, which can, in turn, talk to the outside world. The user's client
program talks to this proxy server instead of directly to the
&quot;real&quot; server out on the Internet. The proxy server
evaluates requests from the client and decides which to pass on and
which to disregard. If a request is approved, the proxy server talks
to the real server on behalf of the client (thus the term
&quot;proxy&quot;), and proceeds to relay requests from the client to
the real server, and to relay the real server's answers back to the
client. </P
><p class="para">As far as the user is concerned, talking to the proxy server is just
like talking directly to the real server. As far as the real server is
concerned, it's talking to a user on the host that is running the proxy
server; it doesn't know that the user is really somewhere else.</P
><p class="para">Proxying doesn't require any special hardware, although it does require
special software for most services.</P

><p class="para">There's no point in connecting to the Internet if your users can't
access it. On the other hand, there's no safety in connecting to the
Internet if there's free access between it and every host at your site.
Some compromise has to be applied. </P
><p class="para">The most obvious compromise is to provide a single host with
Internet access for all your users. However, this isn't a 
satisfactory solution because these hosts aren't transparent to users. 
Users who want to access network
services can't do so directly. They have to log in to
the dual-homed host, do all their work from there, and then somehow
transfer the results of their work back to their own workstations. At
best, this multiple-step process annoys users by forcing them to do
multiple transfers and work without the customizations they're
accustomed to.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7094"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7097"></A
>The problem is worse at sites with multiple operating systems; if your
native system is a Macintosh, and the dual-homed host is a
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> system, the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> system
will probably be completely foreign to you. You'll be limited to
using whatever tools are available on the dual-homed host, and these
tools may be completely unlike (and may seem inferior to) the tools
you use on your own system.</P
><p class="para">Dual-homed hosts configured without proxies therefore tend to
annoy their users and significantly reduce the benefit people get from
the Internet connection. Worse, they usually don't 
provide adequate security; it's almost impossible to adequately secure a
machine with many users, particularly when those users are
explicitly trying to get to the external universe. You can't
effectively limit the available tools, 
because your users can
always transfer tools from internal machines that are the same type.
For example, on a dual-homed host you can't guarantee that all file
transfers will be logged because people can use their own file transfer
agents that don't do logging.</P
><p class="para">Proxy systems avoid user frustration and the insecurities of a
dual-homed host. They deal with user frustration by automating the
interaction with the dual-homed host. Instead of requiring users to
deal directly with the dual-homed host, proxy systems allow all
interaction to take place behind the scenes. The user has the illusion
he is dealing directly (or almost directly) with the server on the
Internet that he really wants to access, with a minimum of direct
interaction with the dual-homed host. <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-07-FIG-1" title="Proxies&nbsp;- reality and illusion">Figure 7.1</A
>
illustrates the difference between reality and illusion with proxy
systems.</P

></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire0701.gif" alt="Figure 7.1"><p class="para">Proxy systems deal with the insecurity problems by avoiding user logins on the
dual-homed host and by forcing connections through controlled
software. Because the proxy software works without requiring user
logins, the host it runs on is safe from the randomness of having multiple
logins. It's also impossible for anybody to install
uncontrolled software to reach the Internet; the proxy acts as a control
point.</P

`directly'</A

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7115"></A
>With the dual-homed host approach, a user needs to log into the
host before using any Internet services. This is often inconvenient,
and some users become so frustrated that they look for ways around the
firewall. With proxy services, users think they're interacting
directly with Internet services.</P
><p class="para">Of course, there's more going on behind the scenes but it's usually
transparent to users. While proxy services allow users to access
Internet services from their own systems, they do so without allowing
packets to pass directly between the user's system and the Internet. 
The path is indirect, either through a dual-homed host, or through a
bastion host and screening router combination.</P

></H4
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7122"></A
>Because proxy servers understand the underlying protocol, they allow
logging to be performed in a particularly effective way. For example,
instead of logging all of the data transferred, an 
<span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> proxy server
logs only the commands issued and the server responses received;
this results in a much smaller and more useful log.</P

>Although proxy software is widely available for the older and simpler
services like <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> and Telnet, proven software for 
newer or less widely
used services is harder to find. There's usually a distinct lag
between the introduction of a service and the availability of proxying
servers for it; the length of the lag depends primarily on how well the
service is designed for proxying. This makes it difficult for a site to
offer new services immediately as they become available. Until suitable
proxy software is available, a system that needs new services may have
to be placed outside the firewall, opening up potential security holes.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-7146">7.1.2.2 Proxy services may require different servers for each
service</A
></H4
><p class="para">You may need a different proxy server for each protocol, because the
proxy server has to understand the protocol in order to determine what
to allow and disallow, and in order to masquerade as a client to the
real server and as the real server to the proxy client. Collecting,
installing, and configuring all these various servers can be a lot of
work.</P
><p class="para">Products and packages differ greatly in the ease with which they can be
configured, but making things easier in one place can make it
harder in others. For example, servers that are particularly easy to
configure are usually limited in flexibility; they're easy to configure
because they make certain assumptions about how they're going to be
used, which may or may not be correct or appropriate for your site.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-7150">7.1.2.3 Proxy services usually require modifications to clients,
procedures, or both</A
></H4
><p class="para">Except for a few services designed for proxying, proxy servers require
modifications to clients and/or procedures. Either kind of modification
has drawbacks; people can't always use the readily available tools with
their normal instructions. </P
><p class="para">Because of these modifications, proxied applications don't work
as well as nonproxied applications. They tend to bend
protocol specifications, and some clients and servers are less flexible
than others. </P

></H4
><p class="para">&#13;Proxying relies on the ability to insert the proxy server
between the client and the real server; that requires relatively
straightforward interaction between the two. A service like
<em class="emphasis">talk</EM
> that has complicated and messy interactions
may never be possible to proxy (see the discussion of
<em class="emphasis">talk</EM

weaknesses</A
></H4
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-7163"></A
>As a security solution, proxying relies on the ability to determine
which operations in a protocol are safe. Not all protocols provide
easy ways to do this. The X Window System protocol, for example,
provides a large number of unsafe operations, and it's difficult to
make it work while removing the unsafe
operations. <span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> is designed to operate effectively
with proxy servers, but it's also designed to be readily extensible,
and it achieves that goal by passing data that's going to be
executed. It's impossible for a proxy server to protect you from the
data; it would have to understand the data being passed and determine
whether it was dangerous or not.</P
