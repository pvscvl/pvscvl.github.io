>If you look at the various firewall architectures outlined in <a class="xref" href="ch04_01.htm" title="Firewall Design">Chapter 4</A
>, you see that there are a variety of places
you might perform packet filtering. Where should you do it? The
answer is simple: anywhere you can.</P
><p class="para">Many of the architectures (e.g., the screened host
architecture or the single-router screened subnet architecture)
involve only one router. In those cases, that one router is the only
place where you could do packet filtering, so there's not
much of a decision to be made.</P
><p class="para">However, other architectures, such as the two-router screened subnet
architecture, and some of the architectural variations, involve multiple
routers. You might do packet filtering on any or all of these routers.</P
><p class="para">Our recommendation is to do whatever packet filtering you can wherever
you can. This is an application of the principle of least privilege
(described in <a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="Security Strategies">Chapter 3</A
>). For each router that is part of
your firewall, figure out what types of packets should legitimately be
flowing through it, and set up filters to allow only those packets and
no more. You may also want to put packet filters on destination hosts,
using <em class="emphasis">screend</EM
>, <em class="emphasis">ipfilterd</EM
>, 
or <span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
> Wrapper. This is
highly advisable for bastion hosts.</P
><p class="para">This may lead to duplication of some filters on multiple routers; in
other words, you may filter out the same thing in more than one place.
That's good; it's redundancy, and it may save you some day if you ever
have a problem with one of your routers&nbsp;- for example, if something was
supposed to be done, but wasn't (because of improper configuration,
bugs, enemy action, or whatever). It provides defense in depth, and
gives you the opportunity to fail safely&nbsp;- other strategies we outlined
in <a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="Security Strategies">Chapter 3</A
>.</P
><p class="para">If filtering is such a good idea, why not filter on all routers, not
just those that are part of the firewall? Basically, because of
performance and maintenance issues. We discuss above what &quot;fast
enough&quot; means for a packet filtering system on the perimeter of
your network. However, what's fast enough at the edge of your network
(where the real bottleneck is probably the speed of the line
connecting you to the Internet) is probably not fast enough within
your network (where you've probably got many busy
<span class="acronym">LAN</SPAN
>s of Ethernet, <span class="acronym">FDDI</SPAN
>, or
perhaps something even faster). Further, if you put filters on all
your routers, you're going to have to maintain all those filter
lists. Maintaining filter lists is a manageable problem if you're
talking about one or a handful of routers that are part of a firewall,
but it gets out of hand in a hurry as the number of routers
increases. This problem is worsened if some of the routers are purely
internal. Why? Because you probably want to allow more services within
your network than you allow between your network and the
Internet. This is either going to make your filter sets longer (and
thus harder to maintain), or make you switch from a &quot;default
deny&quot; stance to a &quot;default permit&quot; stance on those
internal filters (which is going to seriously undermine the security
they provide anyway). You often reach a point of diminishing returns
fairly quickly when you try to apply filtering widely within a
<span class="acronym">LAN</SPAN
>, rather than just at its perimeter.</P
><p class="para">You may still have internal packet filtering routers at boundaries
within the <span class="acronym">LAN</SPAN
> (between networks with different
security policies, or networks that belong to different
organizations). As long as they're at clearly defined boundaries, and
they're up to the performance requirements, that's not a
problem. Whether or not you duplicate the external rules on these
internal packet filters is going to depend on how much you trust the
external packet filters, and how much complexity and overhead the
external rules are going to add.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-6384"></A
