>In order to be fully effective, most security systems require the
<em class="emphasis">universal participation</EM
> (or at least the absence
of active opposition) of a site's personnel. If someone can simply
opt out of your security mechanisms, then an attacker may be able to
attack you by first attacking that exempt person's system and then
attacking your site from the inside. For example, the best firewall
in the world won't protect you if someone who sees it as an
unreasonable burden sets up a back-door connection between your site
and the Internet in order to circumvent the firewall. This can be as
easy as buying a modem, obtaining free <span class="acronym">PPP</SPAN
> or
<span class="acronym">SLIP</SPAN
> software off the Internet, and paying a few
dollars a month to a local low-end Internet service provider; this is
well within the price range and technical abilities of many users and
managers.</P
><p class="para">Much more mundane forms of rebellion will still ruin your security. You
need everybody to report strange happenings that might be
security-related; you can't see everything. You need people to choose
good passwords; to change them regularly; and not to give them out to
their friends, relatives, and pets. </P
><p class="para">How do you get everyone to participate? Participation might be
voluntary (you convince everybody that it's a good idea) or involuntary
(someone with appropriate authority and power tells them to cooperate or
else), or some combination of the two. Obviously, voluntary
participation is strongly preferable to involuntary participation; you
want folks helping you, not looking for ways to get around you. This
means that you may have to work as an evangelist within your
organization, selling folks on the benefits of security and convincing
them that the benefits outweigh the costs.</P
><p class="para">People who are not voluntary participants will go to amazing lengths to
circumvent security measures. On one voicemail system that required
passwords to be changed every month, numerous people discovered that it
recorded only six old passwords, and took to changing their passwords
seven times in a row (in seven separate phone calls!) in order to be
able to use the same password. This sort of behavior leads to an arms
race (the programmers limit the number of times you can change your
password), and soon numerous people are sucked into a purely internal
battle. You have better things to do with your time, as do your users;
it's worth spending a lot of energy to convince people to cooperate
voluntarily, because you'll often spend just as much to force them,
with worse side effects.</P
