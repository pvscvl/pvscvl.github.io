>The rest of this chapter and <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A
> show the
kinds of rules you can specify for your packet filtering router in
order to control what packets can and cannot flow to and from your
network. There are a few things you need to know about these rules.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="CH06ADDACC"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="CH06SRACCADD"></A
>To avoid confusion, the example rules are specified with abstract
descriptions, rather than with real addresses, as much as possible.
Instead of using real source and destination addresses (e.g.,
172.16.51.50), we use &quot;Internal&quot; or &quot;External&quot;
to identify which networks we're talking about. Actual packet
filtering systems usually require you to specify address ranges
explicitly; the syntax varies from router to router.</P
><p class="para">In all of our packet filtering examples, the assumption is that, for
each packet, the router goes through the rules in order until it finds
one that matches, and then it takes the action specified by that rule.
We assume an implicit default &quot;deny&quot; if no rules apply,
although it's a good idea to specify an explicit default (and we
generally do).</P
><p class="para">The syntax used in our filtering examples specifies the number of bits
significant for comparison to other address after a slash character
(/). Thus, 10.0.0.0/8 matches any address that starts with 10; it's
equivalent to 10.0.0.0 with a <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> netmask of
255.0.0.0, or 10.0.0.0 with a Cisco wildcard mask of 0.255.255.255, or
(if it were a filename) 10.*.*.*.</P

>Although we try to be as specific as possible in these examples, it's
impossible to tell you precisely what you have to specify for your
particular packet filtering product. The exact mechanism for
specifying packet filtering rules varies widely from product to
product. Some products (such as the <em class="emphasis">screend</EM
>
package) allow you to specify a single set of rules that are applied
to all packets routed by the system. Others (such as the Telebit
NetBlazer) allow you to specify rules for particular interfaces. Still
others (such as the Livingston and Cisco products) allow you to
specify sets of rules and then apply sets by name to particular
interfaces (so that you might define one set of rules that is shared
by a number of different interfaces, for example, and put the rules
that are unique to a given interface into a different set).</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-5175"></A
>Here are a couple of tips and tricks that can help you deal with
packet filtering rules more effectively and make them more secure.</P
><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Edit your filtering rules offline</EM
></P
><p class="para">The filter editing tools on most systems are usually pretty minimal. 
Also, it's not always clear how new rules will interact with existing
rule sets. In particular, it's often difficult to delete rules, or to
add new rules in the middle of an existing rule set. </P
><p class="para">You might find it more convenient to keep your filters in a text file
on one of your <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> or <span class="acronym">PC</SPAN
>
systems, so that you can edit them there with the tools you're
familiar with, and then load the file on the filtering system as if it
contained commands you were typing at the console. Different systems
support various ways of doing this. For example, on Cisco products,
you can use <span class="acronym">TFTP</SPAN
> to obtain command files from a
server. (Be careful of where you enable a <span class="acronym">TFTP</SPAN
>
server, though. See the discussion of <span class="acronym">TFTP</SPAN
> in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A
> and think about using something like
<span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
> Wrapper to control what hosts can activate that
<span class="acronym">TFTP</SPAN
> server). On Livingston products, there is a
program available from Livingston called
<em class="emphasis">pmcommand</EM
> that downloads commands to the box. On
other products, there are other mechanisms.</P
><p class="para">An added advantage of keeping the filters elsewhere as a file is that
you can keep comments in the file (stripping them out of the copy sent
to the router, if necessary). Most filtering systems discard any
comments in the commands they're given; if you later go look at the
active filters on the system, you'll find that the comments aren't
retained.</P
><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Reload rule sets from scratch each time</EM
></P
><p class="para">The first thing the file should do is clear all the old rules, so that
each time you load the file you're rebuilding the rule set from
scratch; that way, you don't have to worry about how the new rules
will interact with the old. Next, specify the rules you want to
establish, followed by whatever commands are necessary to apply those
rules to the appropriate interfaces.</P
><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Always use <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> addresses, never
hostnames</EM
></P
><p class="para">Always specify hosts and networks in filtering rules by
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> address, never by hostname or by network name
(if your filtering product even supports that). If you specify
filtering rules by hostname, your filtering could be subverted if
someone accidentally or intentionally corrupts the name-to-address
translation (e.g., by feeding false data to your
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> server).</P
></DIV
><p class="para">Here's a simple example to illustrate the differences. We chose these
three systems because they represent somewhat different ways of
specifying filters, not because of any particular preference for them;
in general, other systems are similar to these. For example, Cisco's
products are similar to Livingston's products in that you create sets
of rules, then apply those rules to packets going in a particular
direction through a particular interface. They are different in
details of their syntax, such as in how you specify host addresses and
bitmasks.</P
><p class="para">Let's say that you want to allow all <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> traffic
between a trusted external host (host 172.16.51.50) and hosts
on your internal network (Class C net 192.168.10.0). In our examples,
we would show this case as follows:

> Watch out for implicit defaults. Different filtering systems have
different default actions they take if a packet doesn't match any of
the filtering rules specified. Some systems deny all such packets.
Other systems make the default the opposite of the last rule; that is,
if the last rule was a &quot;permit,&quot; the system default is to
&quot;deny,&quot; and if the last rule was a &quot;deny,&quot; the
default is to &quot;permit.&quot; In any case, it's a good idea to
put an explicit default rule at the end of your list of packet
filtering rules, so you don't have to worry about (or even remember)
which implicit default your system is going to use.</P
