></H2
><p class="para">Strategic decisions need to be understood and made by top-level
management or they will never be successfully implemented. If you don't
have top-level management support for security, you aren't going to have
security; it's that simple. Why wouldn't you have support
from top-level managers? Probably because you haven't addressed their
concerns in ways they understand. Here are some things to consider in
making your case.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-11-S2-6">11.3.1 Involve Everybody Who's Affected</A
></H3
><p class="para">You may be the person with the best understanding of the technical
issues, but you aren't necessarily the person with the best
understanding of the institution's needs as a whole. Strategic and
policy decisions must be made by people working together. You can't just
come up with a policy you like, take it around to a lot of people, and
have them rubber stamp it. Even if you manage to get them to do
it&nbsp;- which may well be more difficult than getting them to help make
intelligent decisions&nbsp;- they won't actually follow it.</P
><p class="para">One major computer manufacturer had a policy forbidding dial-in modems.
Unfortunately, the company's centralized dial-in access didn't satisfy
all of their programmers. Some of these programmers figured out that,
although they couldn't request modem lines, they could redirect existing
fax lines to modems, go home at night, and dial up their work computers.
Even more unfortunately, a programmer in one of the groups with this
habit was fired and proceeded to break into the site. He systematically
tried all the phone numbers in the range the company had assigned to fax
machines until he connected to one of the redirected ones and got a
login prompt from an unsecured machine inside the corporate firewall.
The former employee did significant damage before he was detected and
shut out. He was able to gain a lot of time because the people trying to
shut him out didn't know the modems existed. When they did figure
out that modems were involved, the process of getting rid of them all
proved to be tedious and prolonged, because lines were diverted only
when people planned to use them. </P
><p class="para">That whole incident was the result of the fact that management and
system administrators had a policy that ignored some genuine needs of
the people using the computer facility. The official policy required
dial-in access to be so secure it was almost completely unusable,
and the unofficial policy required dial-in access to be so usable that
it was almost completely insecure. If there had been a policy that
allowed moderately insecure dial-in access, the break-in might have been
avoided, and it certainly would have been easier to detect and stop. It
would also have been avoided if the programmers had agreed that security
was more important than dial-in access, but that kind of agreement is
much harder to achieve than a compromise.</P
><p class="para">In fact, in this case there wasn't much actual disagreement between
the parties involved. If the managers had been asked, they would have
said that letting people work from home was important to them; they
didn't understand that the existing dial-in system was not providing
acceptable service. If the programmers had been asked, they would have
said that preventing people from maliciously deleting their work was
important to them; they didn't understand the risks of what they were
doing. But nobody thought about security and usability at the same
time, and the result was pure disaster.</P

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-11-S2-7">11.3.2 Accept `Wrong' Decisions</A
></H3
><p class="para">You may find that the security policy you come up with is one you
don't particularly like. If this happens because the people who made it
don't understand what they've done, then you should fight strongly to
get it fixed. If, on the other hand, people understand the risks, but
they don't share your priorities, put your objections down in writing
and go ahead with the policies. Yes, this will sometimes lead to
disasters. Nonetheless, if you ask a group to make a decision, you can't
insist that it be your decision. You also can't be sure that your way is
the only right way.</P
><p class="para">Sometimes managers have a genuine willingness to accept risks that seem
overwhelming to system administrators. For example, one computer
manufacturer chose to put one of their large and powerful machines on an
unprotected net, and to give out accounts on the machine to customers
and prospective customers upon request. The system administrator thought
this was a terrible idea and pointed out that the machine was
fundamentally impossible to secure; there were a large number of
accounts, changing rapidly, with no pattern, and they belonged to people
the company couldn't control. Furthermore, the reason the company was
giving out test accounts was that the machine was a fast
parallel processor, which also meant that it might as well have been
designed as the ultimate password-cracking machine. To the system
administrator, it seemed extremely likely that once this machine was
broken into (which was probably inevitable), it was going to be used as
a tool to break into other machines. </P
><p class="para">A battle ensued, and eventually, a compromise was reached. The machine
was made available, but extra security was employed to protect internal
networks from it. (This was a compromise because it interfered with
employees' abilities to use the machine, which they needed to
do to assist the outsiders who were using it.) Management chose to
accept the remaining risk that the machine would be used as a platform
to attack other sites, knowing that there was a potential for extremely
bad publicity as a result.</P
><p class="para">What happened? Sure enough, the machine <em class="emphasis">was</EM
> compromised, and was used to attack at least the internal
networks. The attacks on the internal networks were extremely annoying,
and cost the company money in system administrators' time, but they
didn't produce significant damage, and there was little or no bad
publicity. Management considered this expense to be acceptable,
however, given the sales generated by letting people test-drive the
machine. In this case, conflicting security policies were resolved
explicitly&nbsp;- by discussion and compromise&nbsp;- and the result was a
policy that seemed less strong than the original, but that provided
sufficient protection. By openly and intentionally choosing to accept a
risk, the company brought it within acceptable limits. </P

Different Ways for Different People</A
></H3
><p class="para">You need to recognize that different people have different concerns.
Mostly, these concerns are predictable from their positions, but some
are personal. For example, suppose that:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Your chief financial officer is concerned about the cost of
security, or the cost of not having enough security. </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Your chief executive officer is concerned about the negative
publicity a security incident involving your site could bring, or
about potential loss or theft of intellectual property via the Internet.
 </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A department chair is concerned that tenure reviews will be
revealed.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A mid-level manager is concerned his employees are
squandering all their time reading Usenet news or surfing the Web. </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Another mid-level manager is concerned her employees are
importing virus-infected <span class="acronym">PC</SPAN
> software from the Internet. </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Still another mid-level manager is concerned how best to
provide technical support to customers over the Internet. </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A professor is concerned her data won't be accessible
from other institutions while she's on sabbatical.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">An instructor is concerned that students are stealing answers
from each other or tests from instructors.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Users are concerned about the availability of Internet services
they feel are vital for their jobs. </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Users are concerned they won't be able to work together
if there are too many security issues.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Students are concerned they won't be able to play with the
computers, which is a part of how they learn.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Graduate students and project managers are concerned that
security measures are going to slow down projects with strict
timelines.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">You need to take the time to discover all of these different, legitimate
concerns and address them. You may also decide there are things
that these various people <em class="emphasis">should</EM
> be worried about,
but aren't, because they don't know any better; you have to educate
them about those issues. This means you need to take the time to
understand their jobs, what they want to accomplish with the network,
and how well they appreciate the security issues.</P
><p class="para">Talk to each of these people in terms they care about.
This requires a lot of listening before you ever start talking. To
managers, talk about things like probable costs and potential
losses; to executives, talk about risk versus benefit; and to
technical staff, talk about capabilities. Before you go in with a
proposal, be prepared with an explanation that suits your audience's
point of view and technical level. If you have trouble understanding or
communicating with a particular group, you may find it helps to
build a relationship with someone who understands that group and can
translate for you.</P
><p class="para">You're not trying to deceive anybody. The basic information is the
same, no matter who you're talking to. On the other hand, if a
particular decision saves money and makes for a more enjoyable
working environment, you don't go to the chief financial officer and say
&quot;We want to do it this way because it's more fun,&quot; and then
go the programmers and say &quot;We want to do it this way because it's
cheaper.&quot;</P
></DIV
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-11-S2-9">11.3.4 Avoid Surprises</A
></H3
><p class="para">When it comes to security, nobody likes surprises. That's why you need
to make sure that the relevant people understand the relevant issues
and are aware of, and agree with (or at least agree to abide by), the
decisions made concerning those issues.</P
><p class="para">In particular, people need to know about the consequences of their
decisions, including best, worst, and probable outcomes. Consequences
that are obvious to you may not be obvious to other people. For
example, people who are not extremely
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>-knowledgeable may be quite willing to give out
root passwords. They don't realize what the implications are, and they
may be very upset when they find out.</P
><p class="para">People who have been surprised often overreact. They may go from
completely unconcerned to demanding the impossible. One good break-in,
or even a prank, can convert people from not understanding all the fuss
about passwords to inquiring about the availability of voiceprint
identification and machine gun turrets. (It's preferable to get them to
make decisions while they are mildly worried, instead of blindly
panicked!)<b class="emphasis.bold"></B
></P
></DIV
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-11-S2-10">11.3.5 Condense to Important Decisions, with
Implications</A
></H3
><p class="para">When you're asking a top manager to decide issues of policy, present
only the decision to be made and the pros, cons, and implications of
the various options: not a lot of extraneous decisions. For example,
you shouldn't waste your <span class="acronym">CEO</SPAN
>'s time by asking him
or her to decide whether you should run Sendmail or
<span class="acronym">SMAIL</SPAN
> as your mailer; that's primarily a technical
issue, and one that should be resolved by the relevant technical staff
and managers. On the other hand, you may need to call upon your
<span class="acronym">CEO</SPAN
> to decide strategic issues regarding mail, such
as whether or not everyone in the organization is to have email
access, or only certain people (and if it's to be limited, to whom).</P
><p class="para">Don't offer people decisions unless they have both the authority and the
information with which to make those decisions. Always make it clear why
they're being asked to decide (instead of having the decision made
somewhere else). In most cases, you want to avoid open-ended questions.
 It's better to ask &quot;Should we invest money in a single place to
be a defense, or should we try to protect all the machines?&quot; than
&quot;What do you think we should do about Internet security?&quot;
(The open question gives the replier the option of saying
&quot;nothing,&quot; which is probably not an answer you're going to
be happy with.)</P
></DIV
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-11-S2-11">11.3.6 Justify Everything Else in Terms of
Those Decisions</A
></H3
><p class="para">All of the technical and implementation decisions you make should follow
from the high-level guidance you've obtained from your top managers and
executives. If you don't see which way you should go with a technical
issue because it depends on nontechnical issues, you may need to
request more guidance on that issue. Again, explain clearly the
problem; the options; and the pros, cons, and implications of each
option.</P
><p class="para">When you explain policies or procedures, explain them in terms of the
original decisions. Show people the reasoning process.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-11-S2-12">11.3.7 Emphasize that Many Issues Are
Management and Personnel Issues, not Technical Issues</A
></H3
><p class="para">Certain problems, which some people try to characterize or solve as
technical problems, are really management or personnel problems. For
example, some managers worry that their employees will spend all their
time at work reading Usenet news or surfing the Web. However, this is
not a technical problem, but a personnel problem: the online
equivalent of employees spending the day at their desks reading the
newspaper or doing crossword puzzles. </P
><p class="para">Another common example of misdirected concern involves managers worrying
that employees will distribute confidential information over the
Internet. Again, this usually isn't a technical problem; it's a
management problem. The same employee who could email your source code
to a competitor could also carry it out the door in his pocket on an 8mm
tape (generally far more conveniently and with less chance of being
caught). It is irrational to place technological restrictions on
information that can be sent out by email unless you also check
everybody's bags and pockets as they leave the premises.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-11-S2-13">11.3.8 Don't Assume That Anything Is
Obvious</A
></H3
><p class="para">Certain things that seem obvious to a technical person who is
interested in security may not be at all obvious to nontechnical
managers and executives. As we've mentioned, it's obvious to anyone
who understands <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> that packet filtering will allow
you to restrict access to services by <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> addresses,
but not by user (unless you can tie specific users to specific
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> addresses). Why? Because &quot;user&quot; is
not a concept in <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>, and there's nothing in the
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> packet that reflects what &quot;user&quot; is
responsible for that packet. Conversely, certain things that seem
obvious to managers and executives are not at all obvious to technical
staff, e.g., that the public's perception (which is often
incomplete or simply incorrect) of a problem at your company is often
more important than the technical &quot;truth&quot; of the matter.</P
