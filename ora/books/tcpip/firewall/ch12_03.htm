>The final important aspect of firewall maintenance involves keeping up
to date. You obviously need to keep your system up to date, but before
you can do that, you need to keep yourself up to date.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-12-S2-9">12.3.1 Keeping Yourself Up to Date</A
></H3
><p class="para">The hardest part of firewall maintenance is staying abreast of the
continuous developments in the field. New things are happening every
day; new bugs are being discovered and exploited; new attacks are being
carried out; new patches and fixes for your existing systems and tools
are being made available; and new tools are becoming available. Staying
up to date with all these changes can easily be the most time-consuming
part of a firewall maintainer's job.</P
><p class="para">How do you stay up to date? Well, primarily by staying involved. Find
a set of mailing lists, newsgroups, magazines, and professional forums
you feel comfortable with and follow them carefully. This
section describes the most important ways you can keep involved. <a class="xref" href="appa_01.htm" title="Resources">Appendix A</A
> provides a more complete list, along with
contact information.</P
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="FIRE-12-S3-1">12.3.1.1 Mailing lists</A
></H4
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21518"></A
>There are several mailing lists that might be of interest to anyone
who maintains a firewall; instructions for subscribing to these are
included in <a class="xref" href="appa_01.htm" title="Resources">Appendix A</A
>. The most important list for
folks interested in firewalls is the Firewalls mailing list at
<em class="emphasis">greatcircle.com</EM
>. This list hosts discussions of
the design, installation, configuration, maintenance, and philosophy
of Internet firewalls of all types. The main drawback of the list is
that it can be very busy; there are sometimes more than
100 messages per day posted to the list. To address the problem of
volume, a Firewalls-Digest version of the list is also available;
Firewalls-Digest subscribers receive all of the same messages that
subscribers to the main Firewalls list receive, but the messages are
bundled into &quot;digest&quot; format (there are usually 10 to 20
messages per digest).</P
><p class="para">Another list you should almost certainly subscribe to is the
<span class="acronym">CERT</SPAN
>-Advisory mailing list. This is the list to
which <span class="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN
> posts its new security advisories.
If you are served by a response team other than
C<span class="acronym">ERT-CC</SPAN
> (e.g., one of the other teams in the
<span class="acronym">FIRST</SPAN
>, described in <a class="xref" href="appa_01.htm" title="Resources">Appendix A</A
>),
check to see if that team has its own advisory list and subscribe to
that one as well as to the <span class="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN
> list. Your team
will probably mirror most of <span class="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN
>'s advisories,
and may produce advisories of its own that are relevant to its
constituency (you) that aren't mirrored by <span class="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN
>.</P
><p class="para">Beyond the Firewalls and <span class="acronym">CERT</SPAN
>-Advisory mailing
lists, the choices are less clear. There are several geographic or
industry-specific firewalls lists, e.g., the Academic-Firewalls and
Firewalls-<span class="acronym">UK</SPAN
> lists. There is also a mailing list
called Bugtraq, where detailed discussions of network security holes
take place; if you can wade through the seemingly perpetual flame
wars, you can occasionally find some gems there.</P
><p class="para">There are also product- and package-specific lists for many firewalls
products and packages; for example, there are lists for Livingston,
Telebit, and Cisco routers, Morning Star software, and the
<span class="acronym">TIS FWTK</SPAN
>. If you are using (or contemplating using)
a particular product or package, you should probably subscribe to the
list for that product or package, if there is one. Lists of this kind
are often an invaluable source of technical support, particularly
during widespread security incidents.</P

>In addition to the various mailing lists you might subscribe to, there
are a variety of newsgroups that are directly or indirectly relevant
to firewalls. Many of these parallel the mailing lists mentioned in
the previous section. For example, <span class="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN
>
advisories are posted to the
<em class="emphasis">comp.security.announce</EM
> group, and there are
newsgroups for a variety of commercial and noncommercial network
products. There has been talk of creating a firewalls newsgroup
(probably <em class="emphasis">comp.security.firewalls</EM
>, or perhaps a pair of
related newsgroups: <em class="emphasis">comp.security.firewalls.misc</EM
>
and <em class="emphasis">comp.security.firewalls.announce</EM

would be completely independent of the Firewalls mailing list
discussed above.[3]</P

features on firewalls, although there isn't yet an entire magazine
devoted to Internet security. (However, it's probably just a matter of
time before one appears.) At this point, none of the magazines stand
head and shoulders above the rest in terms of their coverage of
firewalls. One thing to keep in mind about magazines (even tabloid
weeklies like <em class="emphasis">Network World</EM
> and
<em class="emphasis">MacWeek</EM

something on the Net&nbsp;- on the various mailing lists and newsgroups
discussed above&nbsp;- weeks before it appears in the trade press.</P

These include conferences, vendor user groups, local user groups,
professional societies (such as <span class="acronym">IEEE</SPAN

<span class="acronym">ACM</SPAN

people find attending these events invaluable, not so much for the
formal programs presented, but for the contacts they make with other
people who have solved problems similar to those they are currently
facing.</P
><p class="para">At this point, one of the best conferences for Internet firewall
builders and maintainers is the <span class="acronym">USENIX</SPAN

Symposium (generally held annually). If you are a
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

possible ways you can spend a week each year is at the <span class="acronym">USENIX LISA</SPAN

>If you take care to keep yourself up to date, then keeping your
system up to date is a fairly straightforward job. You just need to
deal with whatever new problems you hear about, as you hear about them. &#13;</P
><p class="para">You should be able to collect enough information from the sources
described in the previous section to decide whether or not a new
problem is a problem for your site in particular. Beware that you may
not be able to determine instantaneously whether a problem applies to
your site; it may take a few hours or days for the information you
need to become available to you. You may need to make a judgment call
about what to do about a particular problem in the absence of solid
information, with only vague reports about the problem and its
consequences to go on. Which way you err&nbsp;- towards caution or
convenience&nbsp;- is going to be dictated by your particular
circumstances. These circumstances include the potential problem
involved, what you can realistically do about it, how much your site
cares about security versus availability and convenience, and so on.
Caution would dictate blocking the problem if it's at all possible
that it applies to you. Convenience, on the other hand, would dictate
waiting to take action until you're fairly sure that the problem does
apply to you.</P
><p class="para">There are a couple of principles to keep in mind when you are deciding
what fixes to apply and when.

<dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Don't be in a hurry to upgrade</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Don't be in too big a hurry to install a patch or a fix unless you have
reason to believe that the problem is being, or could be, exploited
against you. It's always better to let somebody else go first, to
discover what new problems the patch or fix creates. We're not
suggesting you should delay very long in installing a relevant
patch, but it's often wise to wait at least a few hours or a couple of
days to see if the patch blows up on anybody else.</P

></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21590"></A
>You don't want to apply patches for problems you don't have. If you do
apply patches in this way, you run a great risk of introducing new
problems. If a patch applies only to a particular piece of software or
a particular release, and you don't use that software or that release,
don't install the patch. If it applies to features that you don't use
in programs that you do use, apply it anyway; you may start using the
features in the future, and at that point you won't remember whether or
not you patched it.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Beware of interdependent patches</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">While you generally shouldn't apply patches for problems you don't have,
be aware that patches for problems you do have may depend on previous
patches for problems you don't have. With any luck, the documentation
for the patch you want to apply says what other patches (if any) are
prerequisites, but this isn't always the case. Sometimes you just have
to make your best guess. Situations like this are where it really helps
to be tied in to the support mailing lists and newsgroups concerning
your platform; you can ask there and see if anybody else has already
figured this out.</P
