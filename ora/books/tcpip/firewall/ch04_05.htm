><p class="para">Systems that might be called &quot;third generation
firewalls&quot;&nbsp;- firewalls that combine the features and capabilities
of packet filtering and proxy systems into something more than
both&nbsp;- are just starting to become available.</P
><p class="para">More and more client and server applications are coming with native
support for proxied environments. For example, many
<span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
> clients include proxy capabilities, and lots of
systems are coming with run-time or compile-time support for generic
proxy systems such as the <span class="acronym">SOCKS</SPAN
> package.</P
><p class="para">Packet filtering systems continue to grow more flexible and gain new
capabilities, such as dynamic packet filtering. With dynamic packet
filtering, such as that provided by the CheckPoint Firewall-1 product,
the Morning Star Secure Connect router, and the KarlBridge/KarlBrouter,
the packet filtering rules are modified &quot;on the fly&quot; by
the router in response to certain triggers. For example, an outgoing
<span class="acronym">UDP</SPAN
> packet might cause the creation of a temporary
rule to allow a corresponding, answering <span class="acronym">UDP</SPAN
> packet
back in.</P
><p class="para">The first systems that might be called &quot;third generation&quot;
are just starting to appear on the market. For example, the Borderware
product from Border Network Technologies and the Gauntlet 3.0 product
from Trusted Information Systems[6]

look like proxy systems from the external side (all
requests appear to come from a single host), but look like packet
filtering systems from the inside (internal hosts and users think
they're talking directly to the external systems). They accomplish
this magic through a generous amount of internal bookkeeping on
currently active connections and through wholesale packet rewriting to
preserve the relevant illusions to both sides. The
KarlBridge/KarlBrouter product extends packet filtering in other directions,
providing extensions for authentication and filtering at the
application level. (This is much more precise than the filtering
possible with traditional packet filtering routers.)</P

>The underlying protocol of the Internet, <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>, is
currently undergoing major revisions, partly to address the
limitations imposed by the use of four-byte host addresses in the
current version of the protocol (which is version 4; the existing
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> is sometimes called <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>v4),
and the blocks in which they're given out. Basically, the Internet has
been so successful and become so popular that four bytes simply isn't
a big enough number to assign a unique address to every host that will
join the Internet over the next few years, particularly because
addresses must be given out to organizations in relatively large
blocks.</P
><p class="para">Attempts to solve the address size limitations by giving out smaller
blocks of addresses (so that a greater percentage of them are actually
used) raise problems with routing protocols. Stop-gap solutions to both
problems are being applied but won't last forever. Estimates for when
the Internet will run out of new addresses to assign vary, but the
consensus is that either address space or routing table space (if not
both) will be exhausted sometime within a few years after the turn of
the century. </P
><p class="para">While they're working &quot;under the hood&quot; to solve the
address size limitations, the people designing the new
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> protocol (which is often referred to as
&quot;<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>ng&quot; for &quot;<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>
next generation&quot;&nbsp;- officially, it will be <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>
version 6, or IPv6, when the standards are formally adopted and
ratified) are taking advantage of the opportunity to make other
improvements in the protocol. Some of these improvements have the
potential to cause profound changes in how firewalls are constructed
and operated; however, it's far too soon to say exactly what the
impact will be. It will probably be at least 1997, if not later,
before <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>ng becomes a significant factor for any
but the most &quot;bleeding edge&quot; organizations on the
Internet. (<a class="xref" href="ch06_01.htm" title="Packet Filtering">Chapter 6</A
> describes
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>v6 in somewhat more detail.)</P
><p class="para">The underlying network technologies are also changing. Currently, most
networks involving more than two machines (i.e., almost anything other
than dial-up or leased lines) are susceptible to snooping; any node on
the network can see at least some traffic that it's not supposed to be
a party to. Newer network technologies, such as frame relay and
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (<span class="acronym">ATM</SPAN
>), pass packets
directly from source to destination, without exposing them to snooping
by other nodes in the network.</P

>In general, sites should obtain and use <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN

addresses that have been assigned specifically to them by either their
service provider or their country's Network Information Center
(<span class="acronym">NIC</SPAN

will prevent sites from having difficulties reaching other sites
because they've inadvertently chosen conflicting <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>
addresses.  Coordinated assignment of addresses also makes life easier
(and therefore more efficient) for service providers and other members
of the Internet routing core.</P
><p class="para">Unfortunately, some organizations have simply picked
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> addresses out of thin air, because they didn't
want to go to the trouble of getting assigned <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>
addresses, because they couldn't get as many addresses as they thought
they needed for their purposes (Class A nets are
<em class="emphasis">extremely</EM
> difficult to come by because there are
only 126 possible Class A network numbers in the world), or because
they thought their network would never be connected to the
Internet. The problem is, if such organizations ever
<em class="emphasis">do</EM
> want to communicate with whoever really owns
those addresses (via a direct connection, or through the Internet),
they'll be unable to because of addressing conflicts.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2434"></A
>RFC1597[7]

recognizes this long-standing practice and sets aside certain
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> addresses (Class A net 10, Class B nets 172.16
through 172.31, and Class C nets 192.168.0 through 192.168.255) for
private use by any organization. These addresses will never be
officially assigned to anyone and should never be used outside an
organization's own network.</P

><p class="para">As RFC1627[8]
 (a followup to RFC1597) points out, RFC1597 doesn't really
address the problem; it merely codifies the problem so that it can be
more easily recognized in the future. If a site chooses to use these
private addresses, they're going to have problems if they ever want to
link their site to the Internet (all their connections will have to be
proxied, because the private addresses must never leak onto the
Internet), or if they ever want to link their site to another site
that's also using private addresses (for example, because they've
bought or been bought by such a site).</P

><p class="para">Our recommendation is to obtain and use registered
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN

<em class="emphasis">must</EM

then use the ones specified by RFC1597, but beware that you're setting
yourself up for later problem. We use the RFC1597 addresses throughout
this book as sample <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN

they won't conflict with any site's actual Internet-visible
