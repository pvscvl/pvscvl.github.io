><p class="para">This book is a practical guide to building your own firewall. It
provides step-by-step explanations of how to design and install a
firewall at your site, and how to configure Internet services such as
electronic mail, <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>, the World Wide Web, and
others to work with a firewall. Firewalls are complex, though, and we
can't boil everything down to simple rules. Too much depends on
exactly what hardware, operating system, and networking you are using
at your site, and what you want your users to be able to do, and not
do. We've tried to give you enough rules, examples, and resources here
so you'll be able to do the rest on your own.</P
><p class="para">What is a firewall, and what does it do for you? A firewall is a way to
restrict access between the Internet and your internal network. You
typically install a firewall at the point of maximum leverage, the point
where your network connects to the Internet. The existence of a
firewall at your site can greatly reduce the odds that outside attackers
will penetrate your internal systems and networks. The firewall can
also keep your own users from compromising your systems by sending
dangerous information&nbsp;- unencrypted passwords and sensitive data&nbsp;- to
the outside world.</P
><p class="para">The attacks on Internet-connected systems we are seeing today are
more serious and more technically complex than those in the past. 
To keep these attacks from compromising our systems,
we need all the help we can get. Firewalls are a highly effective way
of protecting your site from these attacks. For that reason, we
strongly recommend you include a firewall in your site's overall
Internet security plan. However, a firewall should be only one
component in that plan. It's also vital that you establish a security
policy, that you implement strong host security, and that you consider
the use of authentication and encryption devices that work with the
firewalls you install. This book will touch on each of these topics
while maintaining its focus on firewalls.</P
