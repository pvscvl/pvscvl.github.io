></H2
><p class="para">All of the actions we've outlined in the previous sections sound fine
in theory, but you can't actually do any of them reliably without an
incident response plan.  You may personally be able to mount a
sensible response to an attack, but you aren't necessarily going to be
the person who discovers one. You may not even be available at the
time. How will your organization react if someone attacks your system?
Unless you have an incident response plan in place, the people
involved will waste valuable time trying to figure out what to do
first.</P
><p class="para">If you already have a plan in place for disaster or emergency response
of any kind (e.g., fire, earthquake, electrical problems), you're
probably not going to have to change it significantly to meet your
security needs. If you don't have such a plan already, you can probably
use your security incident response plan with only minor modifications
for most emergencies.</P
><p class="para">Your incident response plan need not be an elaborate document, but you
need to have <em class="emphasis">something</EM
>, even if it's only an email
message that records and confirms the details you've all worked out over
lunch at the local sushi bar. You'll be better off than many sites even
if you do nothing more than think about the issues and discuss them with
the relevant people.</P
><p class="para">What's in your plan? </P
><p class="para">The response plan is primarily concerned with two issues: authority
and communication. For each part of the incident response, the plan
should say who's in charge, and who they're supposed to talk
to. Although you'll specify a few steps people will take, incidents
vary so much that the response plan mostly details who's
going to make decisions, and who they're going to contact after
they've decided&nbsp;- not what they're going to decide. This section
summarizes the different parts of a response plan.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-13-S2-8">13.4.1 Planning for Detection </A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21929"></A
>An incident starts when somebody detects an intruder or attacker. That
person might be a system administrator, but more often it's someone
with no official responsibility. If you've properly educated the
people who use your computers, they know they're supposed to
report weird events. Somebody then needs to sort run-of-the-mill
peculiarities from a security incident in progress. Who are the users
going to report to? Who are those people going to report to if they're
still not sure? What are they authorized to do if they are sure?</P
><p class="para">The two cases you really want to plan for are these:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Somebody notices a real security incident in progress at 3
<span class="acronym">A.M.</SPAN
></P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Somebody notices one of your perfectly legitimate users who happens to
be doing vital work from halfway across the globe at 3
<span class="acronym">A.M.</SPAN
> local time. (In Australia, where he's
consulting at the moment, it's a reasonable 5 <span class="acronym">P.M.</SPAN
>)</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">In the first case, you need a procedure which is going to reliably start
up a full incident response immediately. Don't waste any time. It's
going to be embarrassing and expensive if you don't actually get around
to doing anything until your senior security person arrives in the next
morning, takes in enough caffeine to become able to think, and gets
around to looking at some report. (And that's if there is a report in
the first place; without a response plan, it may be weeks before
anyone actually tells someone who can begin to do something about the
situation.) </P
><p class="para">In the second case, it's going to be embarrassing and expensive if you
disconnect the network and get five people out of bed, all to prevent
somebody from doing the work they're paid to do. </P
><p class="para">Either way, it's not a decision you probably want made by a night
operator, or by a user acting alone because he can't figure out how to
call somebody who knows how to tell a real incident from a false alarm.</P
><p class="para">At a small site, you might want to simply post a number that users can
call to get help outside of office hours (for instance, a pager number).
Users might be encouraged to shut down personal machines if they suspect
an attack and know how to shut the machine down gracefully. You want to
be very cautious about this, however, because an ungraceful shutdown,
particularly of a multiuser machine, may be more damaging than an
intruder. </P
><p class="para">At a larger site, one that has on-site support after hours, you should
instruct the on-site support people to call a senior person if they
see a possible security incident. They should be told
explicitly not to do anything more than that unless circumstances are
extreme, but to keep trying to contact senior personnel until they get
somebody who can take a look at what's going on.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-13-S2-9">13.4.2 Planning for Evaluation of the Incident</A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21949"></A
>Who's going to decide that you don't just have a suspicious
situation&nbsp;- you actually have a security problem? You need to designate
one specific person who will have responsibility for making the
important decisions.  It's tempting to pick one specific person in
advance and put his or her name in your plan. But, what if that
person isn't available in the event of an actual incident? Who, then,
will have the responsibility?</P
><p class="para">Teamwork is great, but emergencies call for leadership. You don't want
to have everybody doing their own thing and nobody in charge, and you
certainly can't afford to stand around arguing about it. If your senior
technical person is absent, do you want someone less senior but more
technical to do the evaluation, or do you want someone more senior but
less technical? How much time are you going to spend searching for the
senior technical person when you have an emergency to deal with, before
proceeding to your next candidate for the hot seat?</P
><p class="para">At a small site, you may not have a lot of options; if there's only one
person who has the skills necessary to do something about an attack,
your policy will simply list that person as the one in charge in case of
a security incident. If that person is unavailable, authority should go
to somebody levelheaded and calm who can take stopgap actions and
arrange for assistance (for example, from a relevant response team). In
this situation, technical skills would be nice, but resourcefulness and
calm are more important.</P
><p class="para">At a larger site, there is probably more than one person who could be in
charge. Your plan may want to say that the most senior of them will be
in charge by default, or that whoever is specified as being on call will
be in charge. Either way, the plan should state that if the default
person in charge is unavailable, the first of the other possible people
to respond is in charge. Specifying what order they're going to be
contacted in is probably overkill; let whoever is trying to reach
these people use his or her knowledge of the situation. If none of those
people are available, you'll usually want to work up the organizational
hierarchy rather than down. (A manager, particularly a technical one, is
probably better equipped to cope than an operator.)</P
><p class="para">In a small organization, you will pick your fallback candidates by
name. In a large one, you will usually specify fallbacks by job
title. If job title is your criterion, it's important to base your
decision on the characteristics of the job, not of the person
currently in it. Don't write into your plan that the janitor should
decide, on the theory that the current janitor also is the most
sensible and technical of those who aren't system
administrators. The next janitor might be an airhead with a mop.</P

>Your response plan needs to specify what kind of situation warrants
disconnecting or shutting down, and who can make the decision to do
that. Most importantly, as we've discussed in &quot;Pursuing and
Capturing the Intruder,&quot; are you ever willing to allow a known
intruder to remain connected to your systems? If you're not, are you
going to take down the system, or are you going to disconnect from the
network altogether? </P
><p class="para">If you are at a site with multiple computer facilities, do you want to
take the entire site off the Internet if one facility has been compromised,
or is it better (or even possible) to take just that facility off the
Internet?</P
><p class="para">At most sites, the reasonable plan is to disconnect the site as a
whole from the network as soon as you know for sure that you have an
intruder connected to your systems. You may have a myriad of internal
connections, with a triply redundant, diversely cabled,
<span class="acronym">UPS</SPAN
>-protected routing mesh, which can make
&quot;disconnecting&quot; a daunting prospect (the system keeps
&quot;fixing&quot; itself). On the other hand, you probably only
have one (or a small handful) of connections to the outside world,
which can be more easily severed.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21973"></A
>Your plan needs to say how to disconnect the network, and how the
machines should be shut down. Be very careful about this. You do not
want to tell people to respond to a mildly suspicious act by hitting
the circuit breakers and powering off every machine in the machine
room. On the other hand, if an intruder is currently removing all the
files on the machine, you don't want them to give that intruder a
15-minute warning for a graceful shutdown.</P
><p class="para">This is one case in which you need clear, security-specific instructions
in your plan. Here's what we recommend you do:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">In most security emergencies, the correct way to shut down the
machine is to do an immediate but graceful shutdown, with no
explanations or warnings sent. Your plan should state that and specify
the appropriate commands to issue. </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If the intruder is actively destroying things, you want people to shut
the machine down by the fastest method possible. If they are physically
near the machine, cutting off the power to the machine or the disk drive
is completely appropriate, despite the damage it may cause. This implies
that the relevant power switches must be easy to locate; a master switch
for each machine is a good idea.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">Whoever is going to disconnect the network needs to know how to do that.
Often, the safest and easiest way is to unplug cables and clean up the
side effects afterwards. With networks, this tends to result in
voluminous error messages but to cause no actual damage. You do have to
unplug the <em class="emphasis">relevant </EM
> cables, however, and the
voluminous error messages may make it difficult to determine whether or
not the cables that were unplugged were actually the correct ones. Your
plan needs to tell people what to unplug, and how to make things
functional afterwards.</P

>Your incident response plan needs to specify who you're going to notify,
who's going to do the notification, when they're going to do it, and
what method they're going to use. As we described earlier in this
chapter, you may need to notify:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">People within your own organization</P

></H4
><p class="para">To start with, you need to notify the people who are going to be
involved in the response. You'll have an urgent need to get hold of
them, so you need telephone and pager numbers. Be sure you
have all the relevant phone numbers; in addition to home and work
numbers, check to see if people have car phones or portable phones at
which they might be reached. This list includes anybody who
manages computers within your site and anybody who manages those
people, plus anybody else who might be needed to provide resources (to
sign off on emergency purchases or to unlock doors, for example).
Ideally, the list&nbsp;- or at least the key portions of it&nbsp;- should be
reduced down so it's small enough to carry easily (for example, it might
be laser-printed onto business card-sized stock). Obviously, the list
isn't much use unless it's kept up to date.</P
><p class="para">If there are many people to be notified, you may wish to use a phone
tree or an alert tree. In such a tree, shown in <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-13-FIG-2" title="An alert tree">Figure 13.2</A
>, each person notifies two or three other
people; this is a geometric progression, so a large number of people
can be rapidly notified with relatively little work to any one
person. Everybody should have a copy of the entire tree, so that if
people are unavailable their calls can be taken over by someone else
(usually the person above them on the tree).  It's best to set it up
so as many calls as possible are toll-free, and so that people are
notifying other people they know relatively well (which increases
their chances of knowing how to get through). There's no need for an
alert tree to reflect an organizational chart or a chain of command.</P

><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire1302.gif" alt="Figure 13.2"><p class="para">Next, you're going to notify other people within your organization who
need to know, starting with the users of your computer facility. For
that, you'll use whatever your organization normally uses for relatively
urgent notifications to everybody, whether that's memos or electronic
mail. Your plan should specify how to do that (system administrators
rarely send memos to all personnel and may not know how). </P
><p class="para">Your plan should also show a sample notification message for the users
of your systems. This can sometimes be tricky. Your message needs to
contain enough information so that legitimate users understand what's
happening. They need to know:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">What has been taken out of service</P

></P
><p class="para">Things that are obvious to you may not be obvious to your users (e.g.,
they might not even understand why it's so bad to have an
intruder). Writing an appropriate message (see <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-13-FIG-3" title="A notification message">Figure 13.3</A
>) is not easy, particularly if you're busy and
tired.</P

><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire1303.gif" alt="Figure 13.3"><p class="para">For the remaining people within your organization&nbsp;- people from
other computer facilities, legal, audit, public relations, or
security&nbsp;- the plan needs to specify who gets notified. Do you
need to call the legal department? If so, who should you talk to? Who
are the administrators for other sites within your organization?
During the Morris worm incident in 1988, at least one large government
lab was reduced to having the guards hand out flyers at the gate to
everyone as they came to work, asking &quot;Are you a system
administrator?&quot; because they had no idea who all the system
administrators were, much less how to contact them.</P
><p class="para">Think about <em class="emphasis">how</EM
> you are going to send your
message.  If you send it via electronic mail, remember that the
intruder may see it. Even if you know that your own systems are clean,
don't assume that other people's are. Don't say anything in your
message that you don't want the attacker to know. Better yet, use a
telephone.</P
><p class="para">Some sites use a simple code phrase to announce a system attack that
they can include in electronic mail. This can rapidly degenerate into
bad spy fiction, but if you have an agreed-upon phrase that isn't
going to alert an intruder (and isn't going to cause people who don't
know it or don't remember it to give the game away by asking what on
earth you're talking about), it can be effective. Something like
&quot;We're having a pizza party; call 3-4357 to
<span class="acronym">RSVP</SPAN
>&quot; should serve the purpose.</P
><p class="para">Should you contact your organization's security department? At some
organizations, the security department is responsible only for
physical security. You'll want to have a contact number for them in
case you need doors unlocked, for example, but they are unlikely to be
trained in helping with an emergency of this kind, so you probably
won't need to notify them routinely of every computer security
incident. However, if there is a group responsible for computer
security within your organization, you are probably required to notify
them. Find out ahead of time when they want to be notified and how,
and put that information in the plan. Even if that group cannot help
you respond to your particular type of incident (e.g., they may be
personal-computer specialists, or government-security specialists),
it's advisable to at least brief them on the incident after you have
finished responding to it.</P

your incident response plan says explicitly that they need to
reinstall the operating system, they probably won't. The problem is,
this leads to situations where you have to get rid of the same
intruder over and over again, because the system hasn't been properly
cleaned up. Your response plan should specify what's acceptable proof
that the operating system hasn't been tampered with (for instance, a
comparison against cryptographic checksums of an operating system
known to be uncompromised). If you don't have those tools, which are
