>If you discover a security incident&nbsp;- particularly one in
progress&nbsp;- you're going to be tempted to go gunning for the bad guys
who are invading your system.</P
><p class="para">Going after the bad guys has a certain emotional appeal, but it's
generally not very practical. There are a variety of approaches you can
take, but there are also a variety of technical and legal hurdles.</P
><p class="para">For an appreciation of the problems involved in hunting down an
intruder, see Cliff Stoll's book, <em class="emphasis">The Cuckoo's
Egg</EM
>. In the late 1980s, Cliff was a system manager at
Lawrence Berkeley Labs. While tracking down a minor inconsistency in
the accounting system <span class="acronym">LBL</SPAN
> used for computer time
billing, he discovered evidence that an intruder had broken in over
the Internet. He spent the next many months on an odyssey trying to
chase down the attackers. Although Cliff succeeded admirably (and
wrote an entertaining and useful book to boot), few of us are going to
be able to emulate his feats. Most sites just don't have the time and
resources to track their attackers the way Cliff did; most are going
to have to be satisfied with simply getting them off their systems.</P
><p class="para">There are two main problems in tracking down intruders; one is
technical and the other is legal.</P
><p class="para">The first problem is that tracking an attack back to its ultimate
source is usually technically difficult. It's usually easy to tell
what site an attack came from (simply by looking at the
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> addresses the attacker's packets are coming
from), but once you find the apparent source of the attack, you
usually find out that the attack isn't really being carried out by a
user from that site. Instead, it's very likely that the site has
itself been broken into, and it's being used as a base by the person
who attacked you.</P
><p class="para">If that site traces its own break-in, it will usually discover the
same thing: the attacker isn't wherever the attacks appear to be
coming from. Moreover, where the attacks appear to be coming from is
simply another site in the chain that's been broken into. Each link in
the chain between the attacker and you involves more sites and more
people.  There is a practical limit to how far back you can trace
someone in a reasonable period of time. Eventually, you're probably
going to run into a site in the chain that you can't get in touch
with, or that doesn't have the time or expertise to pursue the matter,
or that simply doesn't care about the attack or about you. As <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-13-FIG-1" title="A network connection has many links">Figure 13.1</A
> illustrates, these are many links in any
network connection.</P
><h4 class="figure"><a class="title" name="FIRE-13-FIG-1">Figure 13.1: A network connection has many links</A
></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/fire1301.gif" alt="Figure 13.1"><p class="para">Furthermore, at some link in the chain, you are likely to discover that
the attacker is coming in over a telephone line, and tracing telephone
calls involves whole new realms of technical and legal problems.</P
><p class="para">You may well find the same attacker coming in from multiple sites. In
one incident, responders kept correcting each other, until they
realized that nobody was confused; one set of people was referring to
<span class="acronym">SFU</SPAN
> (Simon Fraser University, in
Canada) and the other to <span class="acronym">FSU</SPAN
> (Florida
State University). The similarity of the abbreviations had momentarily
concealed the fact that there were two separate sites, physically
distant from each other, being concurrently used by the same
attacker. The attacker had not started from either of them, and when
<span class="acronym">SFU</SPAN
> and <span class="acronym">FSU</SPAN
> closed down access,
identical attacks starting occurring from other sites.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21903"></A
>Be wary when using email or voicemail to contact administrators at
other sites when tracking down an intruder. How do you know it's
really the administrator that's receiving and responding to your
messages and not the intruder? Even if you're sure that you're
talking to the administrator of a site, maybe the intruder
<em class="emphasis">is</EM
> the administrator.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21908"></A
>The second problem is legal. You might contemplate leaving your site
&quot;open,&quot; even after you're aware of the attacker, in hopes
of tracking him down while he's using your site. This may seem like a
clever idea; after all, if you shut down your system or disconnect it
from the Internet, the attacker will know he's been discovered,
and it will be much harder for you to track him down.</P
><p class="para">The problem is this: leaving your site open doesn't just risk further
loss or damage at your own site. What the attacker is probably doing
at your site is using it as a base to attack other sites. If you're
aware of this, and do nothing to prevent it, those other sites might
have grounds to sue you and your organization for negligence or for
aiding the attacker.</P
><p class="para">If you're dealing with someone who's attacking your system
unsuccessfully, there's less risk. It's polite to inform the site that
the attacker is apparently coming from, so the system administrators
there can do their own checking. It also lets you straighten out
people who aren't really trying to break in, but are just very
confused.  For example, attempts to log in as
&quot;anonymous&quot;, even extremely persistent ones, usually
come from people who have confused <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> with Telnet
and simply need better advice. Most sites are grateful to be told that
there are attacks coming from them, but don't be surprised if
universities seem somewhat bored to hear the news. Although they will
usually follow up, large universities see these incidents all the
time.</P
><p class="para">You'll also find that the occasional site is uninterested, hostile, or
incapable of figuring out what you're talking about, and it's not
worth your time to worry about them unless the attacks from them are
persistent, determined, and technically competent enough to have a
chance of succeeding. In this case, you should enlist the assistance
of a response team.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21915"></A
