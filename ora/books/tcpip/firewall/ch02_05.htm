>Mail, <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>, Telnet, and Usenet news have
been around since the early days of the Internet; they're actually
extensions of services provided well before the Internet even
existed. The World Wide Web (<span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
>) is a new,
entirely Internet-based concept, based in part on existing services,
and in part on a new protocol, HyperText Transfer Protocol
(<span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
>).</P
><p class="para">Many people confuse the functions and origins of
<span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
>, Mosaic, and <span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
>, and the
terminology used to refer to these three distinct entities has become
muddy. Some of the muddiness was introduced intentionally; Web
browsers attempt to provide a seamless interface to a wide variety of
information through a wide variety of mechanisms, and blurring the
distinctions makes it easier to use, if more difficult to comprehend.
Here is a quick summary of what the individual entities are about.</P
><p class="para">The <span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
> is the collection of
<span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> servers (see the description of
<span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> below) on the Internet. The Web is
responsible, in large part, for the recent explosion in Internet
activity. <span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
> is based on concepts developed at the
European Particle Physics Laboratory (<span class="acronym">CERN</SPAN
>) in
Geneva, Switzerland, by Tim Berners-Lee and others. Much of the
groundbreaking work on Web clients was done at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (<span class="acronym">NCSA</SPAN
>) at the
University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. There are many
organizations and individuals developing Web client and server
software these days, and many more using these technologies for a huge
range of purposes. Nobody &quot;controls&quot; the Web, however,
much as nobody &quot;controls&quot; the Internet.</P
><p class="para">The Web uses hypertext technology to link together a web of documents,
which may include text, graphics images, sound files, video files, and
other formats. The documents can be traversed in any way&nbsp;- not only
hierarchically&nbsp;- to search for information. Hypertext provides the
navigation from one document to another on the Internet. Users can move
freely from one to another, regardless of where the documents are
located, by simply clicking on a word or picture for which an
<span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> link has been defined. </P

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-931"></A
><span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> is the primary application
protocol that underlies the World Wide Web: it provides users access
to the files that make up the Web. As mentioned above, these files
might be in many different formats (text, graphics, audio, video,
etc.), but the most common format on the Web is the HyperText Markup
Language (<span class="acronym">HTML</SPAN
>). <span class="acronym">HTML</SPAN
> is a
standardized page description language for creating Web pages. It
provides basic document-formatting capabilities (including the ability
to include graphics), and allows you to specify hypertext links to
other servers and files.</P

>Mosaic, developed by Marc Andreessen and others at
<span class="acronym">NCSA</SPAN
>, is an <span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> client, which
is used as a browser of the Web. <span class="acronym">NCSA</SPAN
> Mosaic is
free and runs on Windows, the Macintosh, and many different flavors of
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>. There are many other web browsers available
and as this book goes to press, the most popular is Netscape
Navigator, a commercial product that is available free for nonprofit
and educational use or for commercial evaluation. It also runs on
Windows, the Macintosh, and various <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
machines. (Other Web browsers include Lynx,
Viola<span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
>, perl<span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
>, and
Midas<span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
>.) <span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> is but one
protocol spoken by Mosaic; Mosaic clients typically also speak at
least the <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>, Gopher, and <span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
>
protocols. Netscape Navigator speaks all of those and also
<span class="acronym">NNTP</SPAN
> and <span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN
>. Thus, when users
say &quot;we want Mosaic&quot; or &quot;we want Netscape,&quot;
what they really mean, from a protocol level, is that they want access
to the <span class="acronym">HTTP</SPAN
> servers that make up the
<span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
>, as well as the associated Gopher,
<span class="acronym">WAIS</SPAN
>, and <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> servers (plus, for
Netscape, <span class="acronym">NNTP</SPAN
> and <span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN
>
servers).</P
><p class="para">Web browsers are fantastically popular, and for good reason. They
provide a rich, graphical interface to an immense number of Internet
resources. Information and services that were unavailable or expert-only
before are now easily accessible. In Silicon Valley, you can use the Web
to have dinner delivered without leaving your computer except to answer
the door. It's hard to get a feel for the Web without experiencing it;
it covers the full range of everything you can do with a computer, from
the mundane to the sublime with a major side trip into the ridiculous. </P
><p class="para">Unfortunately, Web browsers and servers are hard to secure. The
usefulness of the Web is in large part based on its flexibility, but
that flexibility makes control difficult. Just as it's easier to
transfer and execute the right program from a Web browser than from
FTP, it's easier to transfer and execute a malicious one. Web browsers
depend on external programs, generically called &quot;viewers&quot;
(even if they play sounds instead of showing pictures), to deal with
data types that the browsers themselves don't understand. (The
browsers generally understand basic data types such as
<span class="acronym">HTML</SPAN
>, plain text, and <span class="acronym">JPEG</SPAN
> and
<span class="acronym">GIF</SPAN
> graphics.) You should be very careful about
which viewers you configure by default; you don't want a viewer that
can do dangerous things because it's going to be running on your
computers, as if it were one of your users, taking commands from an
external source. You also want to warn users not to add viewers, or
change viewer configurations, based on advice from strangers.</P
><p class="para">Because an <span class="acronym">HTML</SPAN
> document can easily link to
documents on other servers, it's easy for people to become confused
about exactly who is responsible for a given document. New users may
not notice when they go from internal documents at your site to
external ones. This has two unfortunate consequences. First, they may
trust external documents inappropriately (because they think they're
internal documents.) Second, they may blame the internal Web
maintainers for the sins of the world. People who understand the Web
tend to find this hard to believe, but it's a common
misconception: the dark side of having a very smooth transition
between sites.</P
><p class="para">Most Web servers are reasonably secure, as shipped. However, they can
also call external programs. These programs are relatively easy to
write, but very difficult to secure. You should treat server-side
extensions with the same caution you would treat a new server of any
kind.</P
