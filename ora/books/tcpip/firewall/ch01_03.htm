>What approaches can you take to protect against the kinds of attacks
we've outlined in this chapter? People choose a variety of security
models, or approaches, ranging from no security at all, through what's
called &quot;security through obscurity&quot; and host security, to
network security.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-8">1.3.1 No Security</A
></H3
><p class="para">The simplest possible approach is to put no effort at all into security,
and run with whatever minimal security your vendor provides you by
default. If you're reading this book, you've probably already rejected
this model.</P

></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-451"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-454"></A
>Another possible security model is the one commonly referred to as
&quot;security through obscurity.&quot; With this model, a system is
presumed to be secure simply because (supposedly) nobody knows
about it&nbsp;- its existence, contents, security measures, or anything
else. This approach seldom works for long; there are just too many ways
to find an attractive target. </P
><p class="para">Many people assume that even though attackers can find them, they
won't bother to. They figure that a small company or a home machine
just isn't going to be of interest to intruders. In fact, many
intruders aren't aiming at particular targets; they just want to break
into as many machines as possible. To them, small companies and home
machines simply look like easy targets. They probably won't stay long,
but they will attempt to break in, and they may do considerable damage
if they do get in while they try to cover their tracks.</P
><p class="para">To function on any network, the Internet included, a site has to do at
least a minimal amount of registration, and much of this registration
information is available to anyone, just for the asking. Every time a
site uses services on the network, someone&nbsp;- at the very least, whoever
is providing the service&nbsp;- will know they're there. Intruders watch for
new connections, in the hope that these sites won't yet have security
measures in place. Some sites have reported automated probes apparently
based on new site registrations.</P
><p class="para">You'd probably be amazed at how many different ways someone can
determine security-sensitive information about your site. For example,
knowing what hardware and software you have and what version of the
operating system you're running gives intruders important clues about
what security holes they might try. They can often get this information
from your host registration, or by trying to connect to your computer.
Many computers disclose their type of operating system in the greeting
you get before you log in, so an intruder doesn't need access to get it. </P
><p class="para">Intruders have a lot of time on their hands, and can often avoid having
to figure out obscure facts by simply trying all the possibilities. In
the long run, relying on obscurity is not a smart security choice.</P

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S3-10">1.3.3 Host Security</A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-464"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-467"></A
>Probably the most common model for computer security is host security. 
With this model, you enforce the security of each host machine
separately, and you make every effort to avoid or alleviate all the
known security problems that might affect that particular host. What's
wrong with host security? It's not that it doesn't work on individual
machines; it's that it doesn't scale to large numbers of machines. </P
><p class="para">The major impediment to effective host security in modern computing
environments is the complexity and diversity of those environments. 
Most modern environments include machines from multiple vendors, each
with its own operating system, and each with its own set of security
problems. Even if the site has machines from only one vendor, different
releases of the same operating system often have significantly different
security problems. Even if all these machines are from a single vendor
and run a single release of the operating system, different
configurations (different services enabled, and so on) can bring
different subsystems into play (and into conflict) and lead to different
sets of security problems. And, even if the machines are all absolutely
identical, the sheer number of them at some sites can make securing them
all difficult. It takes a significant amount of up-front and ongoing
work to effectively implement and maintain host security. Even with all
that work done correctly, host security still often fails due to bugs in
vendor software, or due to a lack of suitably secure software for some
required functions.</P
><p class="para">Host security also relies on the good intentions and the skill of
everyone who has privileged access to any machine. As the number of
machines increases, the number of privileged users generally increases
as well. Securing a machine is much more difficult than attaching it to
a network, so insecure machines may appear on your network as unexpected
surprises. The mere fact that it is not supposed to be possible to buy
or connect machines without consulting you is immaterial; people develop
truly innovative purchasing and network-connection schemes if they feel
the need.</P
><p class="para">A host security model may be highly appropriate for small sites, or
sites with extreme security requirements. Indeed, all sites should
include some level of host security in their overall security plans.
Even if you adopt a network security model, as we describe in the next
section, certain systems in your configuration will benefit from the
strongest host security. For example, even if you have built a
firewall around your internal network and systems, there will be
certain systems exposed to the outside world that need host
security. (We discuss this in detail in <a class="xref" href="ch05_01.htm" title="Bastion Hosts">Chapter 5, <cite class="chapter">Bastion Hosts</CITE
></A
>.)
The problem is, the host security model alone just isn't
cost-effective for any but small or simple sites; making it work
requires too many restrictions and too many people.</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-477"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-481"></A
>As environments grow larger and more diverse, and as securing them on a
host-by-host basis grows more difficult, more sites are turning
to a network security model. With a network security model, you
concentrate on controlling network access to your various hosts and the
services they offer, rather than on securing them one by one.  Network
security approaches include building firewalls to protect your internal
systems and networks, using strong authentication approaches (such as
one-time passwords), and using encryption to protect particularly
sensitive data as it transits the network.</P
><p class="para">A site can get tremendous leverage from its security efforts by using a
network security model. For example, a single network firewall of the
type we discuss in this book can protect hundreds, thousands, or even
tens of thousands of machines against attack from networks beyond the
firewall, regardless of the level of host security of the individual
machines.</P
><blockquote class="note"><p class="para"><strong>NOTE:</STRONG
> Although this book concentrates on network security, please note
that we aren't suggesting you ignore host security. As 
mentioned above, you should apply the strongest possible host security
measures to your most important machines, especially to those machines
that are directly connected to the Internet. You'll also want to
consider using host security on your internal machines in general, to
address security problems other than attacks from the Internet.</P

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="FIRE-01-S2-7">1.3.5 No Security Model Can Do It
All</A
></H3
><p class="para">No security model can solve all your problems. No security
model&nbsp;- short of &quot;maximum security prison&quot;&nbsp;- can prevent a
hostile person with legitimate access from purposefully damaging your
site or taking confidential information out of it. To get around
powerful host and network security measures, a legitimate user can
simply use physical methods. These may range from pouring soda into
your computers to carrying sensitive memos home. You can protect
yourself from accidents and ignorance internally, and from malicious
external acts, but you cannot protect yourself from your legitimate
users without severely damaging their ability to use their
computers. Spies succeed in breaching government security with
depressing regularity despite regulations and precautions well beyond
the resources and tolerance of civilians.</P
><p class="para">No security model can take care of management problems; computer
security will not keep your people from wasting time, annoying each
other, or embarrassing you. Sites often get sucked into trying to make
security protect against these things. When people are wasting time
reading Usenet news, annoying each other by playing tricks with window
systems, and embarrassing the company with horrible email, computer
security looks like a promising technological solution that avoids
difficult issues. Unfortunately, a security model won't work here. It
is expensive and difficult to even try to solve these problems with
computer security, and you are once again in the impossible situation
of trying to protect yourself from legitimate users.</P
><p class="para">No security model provides perfect protection. You can expect to make
break-ins rare, brief, and inexpensive, but you can't expect to avoid
them altogether. Even the most secure and dedicated sites expect to have
a security incident every few years.[2] </P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[2] You can impress a security expert by saying you've only been broken into
once in the last five years; if you say you've never been broken into,
they stop being impressed and decide that either you can't detect
break-ins, or you haven't been around long enough for anyone to try
seriously! </P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Why bother, then? Security may not prevent every single incident, but
it can keep an incident from seriously damaging or even shutting down
your business. At one high-profile company with multiple computer
facilities, a manager complained that his computer facility was
supposed to be the most secure, but it got broken into along with
several others.  The difference was that the break-in was the first
one that year for his facility; the intruder was present for only
eight minutes; and the computer facility was off the Internet for only
12 hours (from 6 <span class="acronym">P.M.</SPAN
> to 6
<span class="acronym">A.M.</SPAN
>), after which it resumed business as usual
with no visible interruption in service to the company's
customers. For one of the other facilities, it was the fourth time;
the intruder was present for months before being detected; recovery
required taking the facility down for four days; and they had to
inform customers that they had shipped them tapes containing possibly
contaminated software. Proper security made the difference between an
annoying occurrence and a devastating one.</P
