an intrusion has occurred. Obviously, this isn't a great approach.
You need a plan for how you're going to respond to a computer security
incident at your site, and you need to develop that plan well before
an incident occurs.</P
><p class="para">There isn't room here to detail everything you need to know to
deal with a security incident: attacks are many and varied; they change
constantly; and responding to them can involve a Byzantine assortment of
legal and technical issues. This chapter is intended to give you an
outline of the issues involved, and the practical steps you can take
ahead of time to smooth the process. <a class="xref" href="appa_01.htm" title="Resources">Appendix A, <cite class="appendix">Resources</CITE

a list of resources that may provide additional help.</P

><p class="para">This section discusses a number of steps you'll need to take when
you respond to a security incident. You won't necessarily need to
follow these steps in the order they're given, and not all of these
steps are appropriate for all incidents. But, we recommend that you at
least contemplate each of them when you find yourself dealing with an
incident.</P
><p class="para">In the section called &quot;Planning Your Response,&quot; later in
this chapter, we'll look again at each of these rules and help you
figure out how to work them into the overall response plan that you
should develop before an incident actually occurs.</P
><div class="sidebar"><h4 class="sidebar"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-21641">Rules for Incident Response</A
></H4
><p class="para">In their book <em class="emphasis">Practical UNIX Security</EM

Garfinkel and Gene Spafford provide two excellent, overriding rules
for incident response. Keep these rules in mind as you read this
chapter and during any real-life incident response.

></H3
><p class="para">The first step in responding to a security incident is to decide what
response, if any, needs to be made immediately. Ask these questions:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Has an attacker succeeded in getting into your systems? If so, you
have a genuine emergency on your hands, whether or not the attacker is
currently active.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Is the attack currently in progress? If so, you need to decide how
you're going to react right now. If the attack isn't currently in
progress, you may not be in such a hurry.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">If the incident looks like an aggressive attack on your system, you
probably want to take strong steps quickly. These steps might include
shutting down the system or your Internet connection until you figure
out how to deal with the situation. </P
><p class="para">On the other hand, if the incident is a less aggressive one&nbsp;- perhaps
someone has just opened a Telnet connection to your machine and is
trying various login/password pairs&nbsp;- then you may want to move more
slowly. If you're reasonably confident that the attack won't succeed
(e.g., you can see that the attacker is trying passwords that
consist of all lower-case letters, and you know for certain that no
account on the system has such a password), you might want to leave
things alone and just watch for a while to see what the attacker does. 
This may give you an opportunity to trace the attack. (However, see the
section below called &quot;Pursuing and Capturing the Intruder&quot;
for a discussion of the issues involved in tracing an attack.) </P

>Once you've evaluated the situation, your next priority is to give
yourself the time to respond without risking your systems further. The
least disruptive alternative is usually to disconnect the affected
machine from all networks; this will shut down any active connections.
 Shutting down active connections may make it harder to trace the
intruder, but it will allow the rest of the people at your site to
continue to do their work, and it will leave the intruder's programs
running. This may help you to identify who the intruder might be.</P
><p class="para">If you're afraid that other machines have been compromised or are
vulnerable to the same attack, you'll probably want to disconnect as
many machines as you can as a unit. This may mean taking down your
connection to the Internet, if possible. If your Internet connection is
managed elsewhere in your organization, you may need to detach just your
portion of the network, but you'll also need to talk to other parts of
your organization as soon as possible to let them know what's happening.</P
><p class="para">In some situations, you may want to shut down the compromised system.
However, this should be a last resort for a number of reasons:

><p class="para">Even if you're responding to an incident that has already ended, you
still might want to disconnect or shut down the system, or at least
close it to users, while you analyze what happened and make any changes
necessary to keep it from happening again. This will keep you from being
confused by things users are doing, and it will prevent the intruder
from returning before you're done.</P

></H3
><p class="para">Your next priority is to start to fix what's gone wrong. The first step
in actually correcting the problem is to relax, think for a while, and
make sure you really understand what's happening and what you're dealing
with. The last thing you want to do is make the situation worse by
doing something rash and ill-considered. Whatever corrective actions
you're contemplating, think them through carefully. Will they really
solve the problem? Will they, in turn, cause other problems?</P
><p class="para">When you're working in an unusual, high-stress situation like this,
the chances of making a major error go way up. Because you're probably
going to be working with system privileges (for example, working as
root on a <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> system), the consequences of an
error could be serious.</P
><p class="para">There are several ways you can reduce the chances of making an error. 
One good way is to work with a partner; each of you can check the
other's commands after they're typed but before they're executed. Even
if you're working alone, many people find that reading commands aloud
and checking the arguments in reverse order before executing them helps
avoid mistakes. Resist the temptation to try to work fast. You will go
home sooner if you work slowly and carefully.</P
><p class="para">Try not to let your users get in the way of your response. You may want
to give someone the specific job of dealing with user inquiries so the
rest of your response team can concentrate on responding to the
incident.</P
><p class="para">Also, try to keep your responders from tripping over each other. Make
it clear which system managers and investigators are working on which
task, so they won't step on each other's toes (or wind up
unintentionally chasing each other as part of the investigation!).</P

to be exploiting an operating system bug, you should probably contact
the vendor to see if they know about it and have a fix for it. At the
very least, they'll be able to warn other sites about the bug.
Similarly, your Internet provider is unlikely to be able to do much
about your immediate problem, but they may be able to warn other
customers. There is also a possibility that your Internet provider has
itself been compromised, in which case they need to know immediately. 
Your vendors and service provider may have special contacts or

anything, or left anything behind.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">At worst, you may need to rebuild your system from scratch. Sometimes
you end up doing this because the intruder damaged things, purposefully
or accidentally. More often, you'll rebuild things because it's the only
way to ensure you have a clean system that hasn't been
booby-trapped. Most intruders start by making sure they'll be able to
get back into your system, even if you close their initial entry point. 
As a result, your systems may be compromised even if the intruder was
present only for a short time. </P

working properly. You want to make sure it passes all relevant
self-tests and diagnostics; you don't want to restore onto a flaky
system. A reinstall may reveal previously unnoticed hardware problems.
For instance, a disk may have bad spots that are in unused files. When
you reinstall the operating system, you will attempt to write over the
bad parts and the problem will suddenly become apparent. </P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21795"></A
>Next, make sure you are using trusted media and programs, not
necessarily your last backup, to restore the system. Unless you are
absolutely sure that you can accurately date the first time the
intruder accessed your system, you don't know whether or not programs
had already been modified at the time the backups happened. It's often
best to rebuild your system from vendor distribution media (that is,
the tapes or <span class="acronym">CD-ROM</SPAN
> your operating system release
came on), and then reload only user data (not programs that multiple
users share) from your backup tapes.</P

packages from the Internet), then do one of the following:

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21810"></A
>This implies that if you're heavily customizing your system or
installing a lot of extra software beyond what your vendor gives you,
you need to work out a way of archiving those customizations and
packages that you're sure can't be tampered with by an attacker. This
way, you can easily restore those customizations and packages if you
need to. One good way is to make a special backup tape of new software
immediately after it's installed and configured, before an attacker
has a chance to modify it.</P
><p class="para">You may have programs that were locally written, and in these cases
you may not be able to find even source code that's guaranteed to be
uncontaminated. In this situation, someone&nbsp;- preferably the original
author&nbsp;- will need to look through the source code. People rarely
bother to modify source code, and when they do they aren't
particularly subtle most of the time. That's because they don't need
to be; almost nobody actually bothers to look at the source
before recompiling it.</P
><p class="para">In one case, a programmer installed a back door into code he expected
would run on only one machine, as a personal convenience. The program
turned out to be fairly popular and was adopted in a number of
different sites within his university. Years after he wrote it, and
long after the original machine was running a version without the back
door, he discovered that the back door was still present on all the
other sites, despite the fact that it was clearly marked and commented
and within the first page of code. You can't make a comprehensive
search of a large program, but you can at least avoid humiliation by
looking for obvious changes.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21815"></A

everything you do. Remember to use the terminal or session that's

going; just make sure you record each session in a separate
file.) It's harder to decide what to record of the events that don't
just get automatically captured. You certainly want to record at least
this much:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Who you called, when, and why.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A summary of what you told them.</P

><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A summary of what they told you. (That summary may end up being
&quot;see above&quot; some of the time, but you still want to be able
to figure out who you were talking to, and when, and why.)</P

><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Meetings and important decisions and actions that aren't captured
online (e.g., the time at which you disconnected the network).</P
