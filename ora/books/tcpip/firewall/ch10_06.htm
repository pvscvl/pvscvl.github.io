>Another issue that is only somewhat related to firewalls (but that the
security folks putting up firewalls are often asked to address) is where
to locate the terminal servers and modem pools within a site's network. 
You definitely need to pay as much attention to the security of your
dial-up access ports as you do to the security of your Internet
connection. However, dial-up security (authentication systems, callback
systems, etc.) is a whole topic of its own, separate from firewalls. 
We'll therefore restrict our comments to those related to firewalls.</P
><p class="para">The big firewall question concerning terminal servers and modem pools
is where to put them: do you put them inside your security
perimeter, or outside? Our advice is to put them on the inside and to
protect them carefully. You'll not only be doing yourself a
favor, you'll also be a good neighbor. Putting open terminal servers
on the Internet is a risk to other people's sites as well as your own.</P
><p class="para">If the modem ports are going to be used primarily to access internal
systems and data (that is, employees working from home or on the
road), then it makes sense to put them on the inside. If you put them
on the outside, you'd have to open holes in your perimeter to allow
them access to the internal systems and data&nbsp;- holes that an attacker
might be able to take advantage of. Also, if you put them on the
outside, then an attacker who has compromised your perimeter (broken
into your bastion host, for example) could potentially monitor the
work your users do, essentially looking over their shoulders as they
access private, sensitive data. If you do put the modems on the
inside, you'll have to protect them very carefully, so they don't
become an easier break-in target than your firewall. It doesn't do any
good to build a first-class firewall if someone can bypass it by
dialing into an unprotected modem connected to the internal network.</P
><p class="para">On the other hand, if the modem ports are going to be used primarily to
access external systems (that is, by employees or guests who mainly use
your site as an access point for the Internet), then it makes more sense
to put them on the outside. There's no sense in giving someone access
to your internal systems if they don't need it. This external modem
pool should be treated just as suspiciously as the bastion host and the
other components of your firewall.</P
><p class="para">If you find that you need both types of access, then you might want to
consider two modem pools: one on the inside, carefully protected, to
access internal systems and another on the outside to access
the Internet.</P
><p class="para">If your terminal servers and modem pools are being used to support
dial-up network connections from homes or other sites, you should make
sure you enforce any implicit assumptions you have about that usage.
For instance, people setting up <span class="acronym">PPP</SPAN
> accounts on
terminal servers generally assume that the <span class="acronym">PPP</SPAN
>
account is going to be used by a single remote machine running
standalone. More and more machines, however, are part of
<span class="acronym">LAN</SPAN
>s, even at home (Dad's <span class="acronym">PC</SPAN
> is
in the den, Mom's in the living room). That <span class="acronym">PPP</SPAN
>
connection could be used not just by the machine you set it up for,
but by anything that machine is connected to, and anything those
machines are connected to, and so forth. The machine that uses the
<span class="acronym">PPP</SPAN
> account might be connected to a
<span class="acronym">LAN</SPAN
>, with any number of other machines on it; any
of them might be connected (via other <span class="acronym">PPP</SPAN
>
connections, for example) to another site or an Internet service
provider. If you don't do anything to prevent it, traffic could flow
from the Internet, to the second PC, to the &quot;legitimate&quot;
PC, and finally into your own net, completely bypassing your firewall.</P
><p class="para">You can prevent this problem by simply enabling packet filtering on
the <span class="acronym">PPP</SPAN
> connection that limits what it
<em class="emphasis">can</EM
> do to what you <em class="emphasis">expect</EM
> it
to do (i.e., that limits packets on the connection to only packets to
or from the machine you expect to be at the other end of the
connection).</P
><p class="para">Some sites with significant dial-up networking activity take the approach
of building a separate firewall just for that activity. See the
discussion of multiple perimeter networks in <a class="xref" href="ch04_01.htm" title="Firewall Design">Chapter 4, <cite class="chapter">Firewall Design</CITE
