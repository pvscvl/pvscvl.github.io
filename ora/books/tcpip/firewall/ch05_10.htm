>How will you know if someone has breached security? Sometimes, it's
painfully obvious. But sometimes, you'll have to draw conclusions
from the behavior of the system. Unexplained reboots or downtime on
the system may be a clue. Many attacks, e.g., modifying a
kernel, can't succeed unless the system is rebooted.</P
><p class="para">On the bastion host, crashes and reboots should be rare
occurrences. Once the bastion host has been fully configured and is in
production, it should be a very stable system, often running for weeks
or months at a stretch without a crash or a reboot. If a crash or a
reboot does occur, investigate it immediately to determine whether it
was caused by some legitimate problem or might have been the result of
some kind of attack.</P
><p class="para">You might want to consider configuring the bastion host so that it
doesn't bring itself up automatically after an attempted reboot. That
way, if someone does manage to crash or force a reboot of the machine,
you'll know about it: the machine will sit there waiting for you to
reboot it. The machine won't be able to come back up until you decide
to do so. Even if your machine does not appear to allow you to disable
autobooting, you can usually cause autoboots to fail by configuring
the machine to autoboot from a nonexistent disk.</P

><p class="para">Backups on a bastion host are tricky because of trust issues. Who can
you trust?</P
><p class="para">You definitely don't want internal machines to trust the bastion host
enough for it to dump to their tape drives. If the bastion host has
somehow been compromised, this could be disastrous. You also don't
want the bastion host to trust the internal machines; this could lead
to subversion of the bastion host by (well-intentioned) internal
users, or to attack from some host pretending to be an internal
system.</P
><p class="para">Common remote dump mechanisms (for example, those used by the
<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> <em class="emphasis">dump</EM
> and
<em class="emphasis">rdump</EM
> programs) will probably be blocked by
packet filtering between the bastion host and the internal systems
anyway (we discuss this issue in <a class="xref" href="ch06_01.htm" title="Packet Filtering">Chapter 6, <cite class="chapter">Packet Filtering</CITE
></A
>). Therefore, you will normally want to do
backups to a tape device attached directly to the bastion host. Under
no circumstances should you rely on backing up the bastion host to
disks that remain attached to the bastion host. You must do backups
that are removed from the bastion host so they cannot be accessed by
an attacker who compromises it.</P
><p class="para">Fortunately, because the bastion host is an infrequently changing
machine, you won't have to do frequent backups. Once the bastion host
is fully configured and in production, it should be very stable. A
weekly or even monthly manual backup will probably be sufficient.</P
><p class="para">Backups of the bastion host aren't done just to guard against normal
system catastrophes like disk crashes.  They're also a tool that you
can use later to investigate a break-in or some other security
incident. They give you a way to compare what's currently on the
bastion host's disk with what was there before the incident.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4006"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4009"></A
>If you're only doing weekly or monthly backups, how you handle logging
becomes an issue. If the bastion host is not being backed up daily,
you <em class="emphasis">must </EM
>do your logging to some system other
than the bastion host itself. If an incident does occur, the logs are
going to be critical in reconstructing what happened. If it turns out
that your only copy of the logs was on the (compromised) bastion host,
and backups of the logs haven't been done for three weeks, you're
going to be severely hampered in your investigative efforts.</P
><p class="para">As with all backups on all systems, you need to guard your bastion host
backups as carefully as you guard the machine itself. The bastion host
backups contain all the configuration information for the bastion host. 
An attacker who gets access to these backups would be able to analyze
the security of your bastion host without ever touching it. With the
information these backups provide, he may possibly find a way to break
in without setting off any of the alarms on the bastion host.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4014"></A
