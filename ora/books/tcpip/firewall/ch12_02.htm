your system. Monitoring is intended to tell you several things:

></H3
><p class="para">You'll do most of your monitoring using the tools and the logging
provided by the existing parts of your firewall, but you may find it
convenient to have some dedicated monitoring devices as well. For
example, you may want to put a monitoring station on your perimeter net
so you can be sure only the packets you expect are going
across it. You can use a general-purpose computer with network snooping
software on it, or you can use a special-purpose network sniffer. </P
><p class="para">How can you make certain that this monitoring machine can't be used by
an intruder? In fact, you'd prefer that an intruder not even detect its
existence. On some network hardware, you can disable transmission in the
network interface (with sufficient expertise and a pair of wire
cutters), which will make the machine impossible to detect and extremely
difficult for an intruder to use (because it can't reply). If you have
source for your operating system, you can always disable transmission
there; however, in this case, it's much harder to be certain you've
been successful. In most cases, you'll have to settle for extremely
cautious configuration of the machine. Treat it like a bastion host that
needs to do less and be more secure.</P

>In a perfect world, you'd like to know absolutely everything that goes
through your firewall&nbsp;- every packet dropped or accepted, every
connection requested. In the real world, neither the firewall nor your
brain can cope with that much information. To come up with a
practical compromise, you'll want to turn on the most verbose logging
that doesn't slow down your machines too much and that doesn't fill up
your disks too fast; then, you'll want to summarize the logs that are
produced.</P

>You can improve the disk space problem by writing verbose logs to
high-capacity tapes. <span class="acronym">DAT</SPAN
> and 8mm tapes are cheap,
and they hold a lot of data, but they have some drawbacks. They're not
particularly fast; they rarely can write at more than 800K a second, under
the best circumstances, and log entries are generally too short to
achieve maximum performance. They're also annoying to read data
from. If you're interested in using them, write summary logs to disk,
and write everything to tape. If you find a situation where you need
more data, you can go back to the tape for it. A tape drive can
probably keep up with the packets on an average Internet connection,
but it won't keep up with an internal connection at full
<span class="acronym">LAN</SPAN
> speeds or even with a T-1 connection to the
Internet that's at close to its maximum performance.</P

> For security reasons, some information should never be logged where an
intruder could possibly be able to read it. For example, although
you should log failed login attempts, you should not log the password
that was used in the failed attempt. Users frequently mistype their own
passwords, and logging these mistyped passwords would make it easier for
a computer cracker to break into a user's account.</P
><p class="para">Some system administrators believe that the account name should also not
be logged on failed login attempts, especially when the account typed by
the user is nonexistent. The reason is that users occasionally type
their passwords when they are prompted for their user names. If invalid
accounts are logged, it might be possible for an attacker to use
those logs to infer people's passwords.</P

>What are you watching for? You want to know what your usual pattern
is (and what trends there are in it), and you want to be alerted to
any exceptions to that pattern. To recognize when things are going
wrong, you have to understand what happens when things are going
right. It's important to know what messages
you get when everything is working. Most systems produce error
messages that sound peculiar and threatening even when they're working
perfectly well. For example, in the sample <em class="emphasis">syslog</EM
> output in <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-12-EX-1" title="A Sample syslog File (Line Numbers Added)">Example 12.1</A
>, messages 10, 14,

<span class="acronym">OK</SPAN

(See the section in <a class="xref" href="ch05_01.htm" title="Bastion Hosts">Chapter 5</A
> called &quot;Setting
Up System Logs.&quot;) If you see those messages for the first time
when you're trying to debug a problem, you're likely to leap to the
conclusion that the messages have something to do with your problem
and get thoroughly sidetracked. Even if you never do figure out what
the messages are and why they're appearing, just knowing that certain
messages appear even when things are working fine will save you time.</P

><p class="para">Most of your logging will probably be done via the
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

other similar file-based log mechanism. You'll need to develop
log-scanning scripts to analyze each of these log files on a regular
basis. Some firewall packages, such as the <span class="acronym">TIS FWTK</SPAN

logs. You could use these scripts as templates for your own logging,

readable (even with better linebreaks inserted!). An unimportant error
condition on a distant host (the server name mismatch on

messages (11, 12, and 13, in this highly condensed version). The log
file is also in chronological order, which is not particularly the order
of importance. <a class="xref" href="#FIRE-12-EX-2" title="A Report Based on a syslog File">Example 12.2</A

>In general, it's safer to write scripts to filter out messages to be
ignored (leaving unusual stuff), rather than writing scripts to identify
the unusual stuff directly. The reason for this is that you seldom know
all of the different messages your firewall might produce. It's easier
to ignore the benign messages than to recognize the dangerous ones. </P
><p class="para">Log messages fall into three categories:

<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Known to be <span class="acronym">OK</SPAN
></EM
> (e.g.,
&quot;login succeeded for user smith&quot;): You
would like to ignore these. Message 3 is clearly in this category.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Known to be dangerous</EM
> (e.g.,
&quot;bad disk block at location 0x47c7a8&quot;):
You would like these to cause some action to happen; this may be
anything from sending someone email, to submitting a trouble ticket,
to paging you.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Unknown</EM
>: You would like these to be sent off for
a human to examine. Message 18 is one of these; why is someone sending
<span class="acronym">UDP</SPAN
> packets from port 20 to an arbitrary port above
1024? That doesn't match any common protocol.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><p class="para">Setting up the criteria is an iterative process; once a human has
examined a mystery message, future examples of that message can
probably be classified as either <span class="acronym">OK</SPAN
> or dangerous
without being examined again. You'll change the rules as time goes
on.</P
><p class="para">Often, log entries must be considered in context. A message that's
mildly mysterious if it occurs once is cause for serious worry if it
occurs every minute. For example, &quot;login succeeded for user
smith&quot; is good, unless it's preceded by three &quot;login
failed&quot; messages for every user above &quot;smith&quot; in
your password file; in that case, it's very bad indeed. In the
<em class="emphasis">syslog</EM
> example, message 9 shows an unexceptional
outbound TCP connection, logged just on general principles. It
wouldn't be at all worrying if it weren't preceded by messages 6
through 8. In context, you know that someone made three failed tries
at logging in as &quot;admin,&quot; finally succeeded, and then
immediately started up an outbound connection. This looks extremely
suspicious. Message 7 doesn't mean anything at all without context.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-21359"></A

>Inevitably, you're going to detect apparent probes of your
firewall&nbsp;- packets sent to services you don't offer to the
Internet, attempts to log in to nonexistent accounts, and so
on. Probes are the Internet equivalent of someone walking down a line
of doors and checking every door knob to see if it's locked. Probers
generally try one or two things, and, if they don't get an interesting
response, they move on.  If you're inclined to do so, you can spend a
lot of time chasing down incidents like this, attempting to figure out
where the probes are coming from and who is behind them. However, in
most situations, it probably isn't worth the effort. The novelty of
chasing down probes of this kind fades quickly. If you're getting
persistent probes from some site, you might contact the management of
that site to let them know what's going on, but that's usually about
as far as folks need to go in responding to these probes.</P
><p class="para">It's unfortunate that on the Internet today, probes are so frequent that
the laissez faire attitude we've described is often an appropriate one.
In good neighborhoods, people don't get away with trying doorknobs. You
have a right to be unhappy with people who behave this way, and trying
to get them to stop is perfectly reasonable. However, you do need to
decide where you're going to spend your energy. Save extreme responses
for extreme situations. Treating probers with maximum harshness is just
going to convince people that you are unreasonable. </P
><p class="para">Some people amuse themselves by setting up firewall machines to lead
on people who try common probes. For example, they put a password
file in the anonymous <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> area that appears to
contain user account data. However, if the prober breaks the
encrypted passwords, he sees a snide message. This is a harmless way
to spend your spare time, and it provides a satisfactory feeling of
revenge, but it doesn't actually improve your security much. It
simply annoys attackers, and doing so may cause them to take a
personal interest in breaking into your site.</P
><p class="para">Different sites have different opinions about what constitutes a
probe, and what constitutes a full-fledged attack. Most people call
something a probe as long as they know it's not going to work, even if
it is determined and drawn out. For example, somebody who
determinedly tries every possible combination of lowercase alphabetic
characters as your root password is not going to succeed, and can
probably be ignored as a probe until you get tired of reading the log
messages. (That kind of attack won't succeed, no matter how
many combinations are tried.) However, if you have the time and the
energy, it's probably worth pursuing people who are making determined
attempts, even when you know they'll fail.</P
