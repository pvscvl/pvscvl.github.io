>forces attackers to use a narrow
channel, which you can monitor and control. There are probably many
examples of choke points in your life: the toll booth on a bridge, the
check-out line at the supermarket, the ticket booth at a movie theatre.</P
><p class="para">In network security, the firewall between your site and the Internet
(assuming that it's the only connection between your site and the
Internet) is such a choke point; anyone who's going to attack your site
from the Internet is going to have to come through that channel, which
should be defended against such attacks. You should be watching
carefully for such attacks and be prepared to respond if you see them.</P
><p class="para">A choke point is useless if there's an effective way for an attacker to
go around it. Why bother attacking the fortified front door if the
kitchen door around back is wide open? Similarly, from a network
security point of view, why bother attacking the firewall if there are
dozens or hundreds of unsecured dial-up lines that could be attacked more easily and probably more successfully? </P
><p class="para">A second Internet connection&nbsp;- even an indirect one, like a connection
to another company which has its own Internet connection elsewhere&nbsp;- is
an even more threatening breach. Internet-based attackers might not
have a modem available, or might not have gotten around to acquiring
phone service they don't need to pay for, but they can certainly find
even roundabout Internet connections to your site.</P
><p class="para">A choke point may seem to be putting all your eggs in one basket, and
therefore a bad idea, but the key is that it's a basket you
can guard carefully. The alternative is to split your attention
among many different possible avenues of attack. If you split your
attention in this way, chances are that you won't be able to do an
adequate job of defending any of the avenues of attack, or that someone
will slip through one while you're busy defending another (where they
may even have staged a diversion specifically to draw your attention
away from their real attack).</P
