><p class="para">An unfortunate side
effect of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>'s popularity is that there are many
different versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>; today, nearly every
computer manufacturer has its own. Until recently, only <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> operating
systems sold by AT&amp;T could be called &quot;<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>&quot;
because of licensing restrictions. Others manufacturers adopted
names such as SunOS (Sun Microsystems), Solaris (also Sun Microsystems),
Xenix (Microsoft), HP-UX (Hewlett-Packard), <span class="acronym">A/UX</SPAN
> (Apple),
Dynix (Sequent), <span class="acronym">OSF</SPAN
>/1 (Open Software foundation),
Linux (Linus Torvalds), Ultrix (Digital Equipment Corporation),
and <span class="acronym">AIX</SPAN
> (<span class="acronym">IBM</SPAN
>)-to name a few.
Practically every supplier of a <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> or <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>-like
operating system made its own changes to the operating system. Some
of these changes were small, while others were significant. Some
of these changes have dramatic security implications, and unfortunately,
many of these implications are usually not evident. Not every vendor
considers the security implications of their changes before making
them. </P

>When we wrote
the first edition of this book, there were two main families of 
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>: AT&amp;T System V, and Berkeley's <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>.
There were also some minor variations, including AT&amp;T System
III, Xenix, System 8, and a few others. For many years, there was
a sharp division between System V and <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> systems.
System V was largely favored by industry and government because
of its status as a well-supported, &quot;official&quot; version of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>. 
<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>, meanwhile, was largely favored by academic
sites and developers because of its flexibility, scope, and additional
features.</P
><p class="para">As we describe in <a class="xref" href="ch01_01.htm" title="Introduction">Chapter 1</A
>,
the two main families of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> reunited several
years ago in the form of System V Release 4 (usually referred to
as V.4 or <span class="acronym">SVR4</SPAN
>). Many of the better features
of <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> 4.3 <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> were built
into <span class="acronym">SVR4,</SPAN
> resulting in a system that combines
many of the best features of both systems (as well as a few of the
worst, unfortunately). This now represents the dominant basis for
most modern versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>, with the notable
exception of the &quot;free&quot; versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>: <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> 4.4,
Free<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>, and Linux.</P
><p class="para">This book covers 
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> security as it relates to common versions
of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>. Specifically, we have attempted to present
the material here as it pertains to <span class="acronym">SVR4</SPAN
> and then
note differences with respect to other versions. Because of our
long-standing experience with (and fondness for) the <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>-derived
versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>, we will often refer to feature
differences in terms of &quot;<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>-derived features&quot;
and &quot;AT&amp;T-derived features,&quot; even though <span class="acronym">SVR4</SPAN
> may
be thought of as having both. When you encounter these terms, think
of &quot;<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>-derived&quot; as meaning <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> systems,
Ultrix, SunOS 3.X and 4.X, Solaris 2.x, and <span class="acronym">SVR4</SPAN
>. When
you encounter the term &quot;AT&amp;T-derived,&quot; think of System V Release
3, Solaris 2.x, and, to some extent, <span class="acronym">AIX</SPAN
> and
HP-UX.</P
><p class="para">Particular details in this book concerning specific 
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> commands, options, and side effects are
based upon the authors' experience with AT&amp;T System V Release
3.2 and 4.0, Berkeley <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> Release 4.3 and 4.4, 
<span class="acronym">NEXTSTEP</SPAN
>, Digital <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> (the
new name for <span class="acronym">OSF</SPAN
>/1), SunOS 4.0 and 4.1, Solaris
2.3 and 2.4, and Ultrix 4.0. We've also had the benefit of our technical
reviewers' long experience with other systems, such as <span class="acronym">AIX</SPAN
>, 
<span class="acronym">HP-UX</SPAN
>, and Linux. As these systems are representative
of the majority of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> machines in use, it is
likely that these descriptions will suffice for most machines to which
the reader will have access.</P
><blockquote class="note"><p class="para"><strong>NOTE:</STRONG
> Throughout this book, we generally refer to System V
Release 4 as <span class="acronym">SVR4</SPAN
>. When we refer to SunOS without
a version number, assume that we are referring to SunOS 4.1.x. When
we refer to Solaris without a version number, assume that we are
referring to Solaris 2.x.</P

><p class="para">Many <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> vendors
have modified the basic behavior of some of their system commands,
and there are dozens upon dozens of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> vendors.
As a result, we don't attempt to describe every specific feature
offered in every version issued by every manufacturer-that would only
make the book longer, as well as more difficult to read. It would
also make this book inaccurate, as some vendors change their systems
frequently. Furthermore, we are reluctant to describe special-case
features on systems we have not been able to test thoroughly ourselves.
Whether you're a system administrator or an ordinary user, it's
vital that you read the reference pages of your own particular 
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> system to understand the differences between
what is presented in this volume and the actual syntax of the commands
that you're using. This is especially true in situations in which
you're depending upon the specific output or behavior of a program
to verify or enhance the security of your system.</P

><p class="para">One
of the difficulties in writing a book such as this is that there
are many, many versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>. All of them have
differences: some minor, some significant. Our problem, as you shall see,
is that even apparently minor difference between two operating systems can
lead to dramatic differences in overall security. Simply changing
the protection settings on a single file can turn a secure operating
system into an unsecure one.</P
><p class="para">The Linux operating system
makes things even more complicated. That's because Linux is an anarchic,
moving target. There are many different versions of Linux. Some
have minor differences, such as the installation of a patch or two.
Others are drastically different, with different kernels, different
driver software, and radically different security models. </P
><p class="para">Linux
is not the only free form of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>. After the
release of Berkeley 4.3, the Berkeley Computer Systems Research
Group (<span class="acronym">CSRG</SPAN
>) (and a team of volunteers across
the Internet) worked to develop a final release, <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> 4.4,
which was devoid of all AT&amp;T code. Somewhere along the line the
project split into several factions, eventually producing three
operating systems: <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> 4.4, Net<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>,
and Free<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>. Today there are several versions
of each of these operating systems. There are also systems based
on Mach and employing <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>-like utilities from
a number of sources.</P
><p class="para">Today, the world of free <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> is
a maelstrom. It's as if commercial <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> was being
promoted and developed by several thousand different vendors. Thus, if
you want to run Linux, or Net<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>, or Free<span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>,
or any other such system securely, it is vitally important that
you know exactly what software you are running on your computer. 
<em class="emphasis">Merely reading your manual may not be enough! </EM
>You
may have to read the source code. You may have to verify that the
source code that you are reading actually compiles to produce the binaries
that you are running!</P
><p class="para">Also, please note that<em class="emphasis"> </EM
>we
cannot possibly describe (or even know) all the possible variations
and implications, so don't assume that we have covered all the nuances
of your particular system. When in doubt, check it out.</P

><blockquote class="note"><p class="para"><strong>NOTE:</STRONG
> By writing this book, we hope to provide information
that will help users and system administrators improve the security
of their systems. We have tried to ensure the accuracy and completeness
of everything within this book. However, as we noted previously,
we can't be sure that we have covered everything, and we can't know
about all the quirks and modifications made to every version and
installation of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

so many versions, furthermore, that sometimes it is easy to get
similar but different versions confused. Thus, we can't promise
that your system security will never be compromised if you follow
all our advice, but we can feel sure in promising that attacks will
be less likely. We encourage readers to tell us of significant differences
between their own experiences and the examples presented in this
book; those differences may be noted in future editions.</P

><p class="para">Over time,
several vendors have developed &quot;secure&quot; versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>,
often known as &quot;trusted <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>.&quot; These systems
embody mechanisms, enhancements, and restraints described in various
government standards documents. These enhanced versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

designed to work in <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-406"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-408"></A
>Multi-Level Security (<span class="acronym">MLS</SPAN

and Compartmented-Mode Workstation (<span class="acronym">CMW</SPAN

there are severe constraints designed to prevent the mixing of data
and code with different security classifications, such as Secret
and Top-Secret. Trusted Xenix and System <span class="acronym">V/MLS</SPAN

two of the better-known instances of trusted <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

><p class="para">Secure <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

features added to them including access control lists, data labeling,
and enhanced auditing. They also remove some traditional features
of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

privileges, and access to some device files. Despite these changes,
the systems still bear a resemblance to standard <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

><p class="para">These systems are not in widespread use outside of selected
government agencies. It seems doubtful to us that they will ever
enjoy widely popular acceptance because many of the features only
make sense within the context of a military security policy. On
the other hand, some of these enhancements are useful in the commercial
environment as well, and C2 security features are already common
in many modern versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>. </P
><p class="para">Today
trusted <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> systems are often more difficult
to use in a wide variety of environments, more difficult to port
programs to, and more expensive to obtain and maintain. Thus, we
haven't bothered to describe the quirks and special features of
these systems in this book. If you have such a system, we recommend
that you read the vendor documentation carefully and repeatedly.
If these systems become more commonly accepted, we'll describe them
in a future edition.</P
