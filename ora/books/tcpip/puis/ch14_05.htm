physical protection is often overlooked, protecting the physical

line is physically secure. Lock all junction boxes. Place the telephone
line itself in an electrical conduit, pulled through walls, or at
least located in locked areas. An intruder who gains physical access
to your telephone line can attach his or her own modem to the line
and intercept your telephone calls before they reach your computer.
By spoofing your users, the intruder may learn their login names
and passwords. Instead of intercepting your telephone calls, an
intruder might simply monitor them, making a transcript of all of
the information sent in either direction. In this way, the intruder
might learn passwords not only to your system, but to all of the
systems to which your users connect.</P

If your telephone
can be programmed for call forwarding, an intruder can effectively
transfer all incoming telephone calls to a number of his choosing.
If there is a computer at the new number that has been programmed
to act like your system, your users might be fooled into typing
their usernames and passwords.</P

If all your modem
usage is to a single outside location, consider getting a leased
line. A leased line is a dedicated circuit between two points provided
by the phone company. It acts like a dedicated cable, and cannot
be used to place or receive calls. As such, it allows you to keep
your connection with the remote site, but it does not allow someone
to dial up your modem and attempt a break-in. Leased lines are more
expensive than regular lines in most places, but the security may
outweigh the cost. Leased lines offer another advantage: you can
usually transfer data much faster over leased lines than over standard
telephone lines.</P
