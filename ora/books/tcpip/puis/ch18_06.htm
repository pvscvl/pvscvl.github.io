>It is
impossible to eliminate one's dependence on other individuals
and organizations. Computers need electricity to run, which makes
most computer users dependent on their power company for continued
operations. You can purchase an electrical generator or a solar
power system, but this simply shifts the dependence from the power
company to the firm that supplies the fuel to the generator, or
the firm that makes replacement parts for the solar power system.[7]</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[7] There is also a dependence on the continued operation of Sol
itself.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Most organizations attempt to limit their risk by arranging
for multiple suppliers of their key resources. For example, you
might purchase your electricity from a utility, but have a diesel
generator for backup. If you are a newspaper, you might have several
suppliers for paper. That way, if you have a dispute with one supplier,
you can still publish your newspaper by buying from another.</P
><p class="para">Likewise, it is important to be sure that you have multiple
suppliers for all of your key computer resources. It is unwise to
be in a position where the continued operation of your business
depends on your continued relationship with an outside supplier,
because this gives the supplier control over your business.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-25661"></A
>Today,
there are many choices for organizations that are deploying Web
servers. Web servers can be run on a wide variety of platforms,
including <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>, Windows, and Macintosh. And there
are many different Web servers available for the same hardware.</P
><p class="para">There are fewer choices available when organizations need
to purchase secure Web servers&nbsp;- that is, Web servers that
provide for cryptographic protection of data and authentication
of their users. This restriction is a result of the fact that the
use of <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-25666"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-25668"></A
>
public-key
cryptography in the United States will be covered by patents until
the year 1997 (in the case of the <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-25671"></A
>
Diffie-Hellman and <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-25673"></A
>
Hellman-Merkle
patents) or the year 2000 (in the case of the <span class="acronym">RSA</SPAN
>
patent). Currently, the use of these patents is controlled by two
companies, Cylink, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., and <span class="acronym">RSA</SPAN
>
Data Security, based in Redwood City, California. Because of the
existence of these patents, and because of the widespread adoption
of the <span class="acronym">RSA</SPAN
> technology by the Web community, it
is highly unlikely that a server that implements cryptographic security
will be produced and sold in the United States that is not licensed,
directly or indirectly, by <span class="acronym">RSA</SPAN
> Data Security.</P
><p class="para">One of the primary purposes of encryption is to provide absolute
assurances to consumers that when the consumer contacts a Web server,
the Web server actually belongs to the company to which it claims
to belong. You can't trust the Web server itself. So companies
such as Netscape Communications have turned to a trusted third party,
<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-25680"></A
>
Verisign Inc. Netscape has embedded
Verisign's public key in both its Secure Commerce Server
and its Web browser. The browser will not switch into its secure,
encrypted mode unless it is presented a digital ID from the server
that is signed by Verisign's secret key.</P
><p class="para">And Netscape is not alone. At the time of this writing (December
1995), all secure Web servers and browsers used Verisign as their
trusted certification authority. Although there are plans for other
such authorities, none currently exist.</P
><p class="para">This presents businesses with a dilemma. The reason is that
digital ID's signed by Verisign must be renewed every year
to remain valid. But Verisign is under no legal obligation to renew
the IDs. This means that, should a dispute arise between Verisign
and a company using a secure Web browser, Verisign could simply
choose not to renew the company's key, and the company
would lose the cryptographic capabilities of its program. Note this
is not a problem with Verisign, per se, but with the whole scheme
of certification authorities with whom you have no direct contractual
relationship.</P
><p class="para">There are several solutions to this problem. The obvious one
is for there to be alternative certification authorities, and for
browsers and servers to accept digital identification credentials
from any certification authority, giving the user the choice of
whether or not the authority should be trusted. We have been told
that these changes will be made in a future version of Netscape's
Navigator. But we include this discussion to illustrate the risk
of depending on third parties. Even if these risks are minimized
in the Netscape products, third-party dependencies are likely to
continue in many different forms. Be on the lookout for them!</P
