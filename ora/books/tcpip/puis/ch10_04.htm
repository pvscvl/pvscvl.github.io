>Although
not obvious, there are some files that are kept on a per-user basis
that can be helpful in analyzing when something untoward has happened
on your system. While not real log files, as such, they can be treated
as a possible source of information on user behavior.</P

>history
file</I
>. When the user issues commands, the text of each
command and its arguments are stored into the history file for later
re-execution. If you are trying to recreate activity performed on
an account, possibly by some intruder, the contents of this file
can be quite helpful when coupled with system log information. You
must check the modification time on the file to be sure that it
was in use during the time the suspicious activity occurred. If
it was created and modified during the intruder's activities,
you should be able to determine the commands run, the programs compiled,
and sometimes even the names of remote accounts or machines that
might also be involved in the incident. Be sure of your target,
however, because this is potentially a violation of privacy for
the real user of this account.</P
><p class="para">Obviously, an aware intruder will delete the file before logging
out. Thus, this mechanism may be of limited utility. However, there
are two ways to increase your opportunity to get a useful file.
The first way is to force the logout of the suspected intruder,
perhaps by using a signal or shutting down the system. If a history
file is being kept, this will leave the file on disk where it can
be read. The second way to increase your chances of getting a usable
file is to make a hard link to the existing history file, and to
locate the link in a directory on the same disk that is normally
inaccessible to the user (e.g., in a root-owned directory). Even
if the intruder unlinks the file from the user's directory,
it can still be accessed through the extra link.</P
><p class="para">Also note that this technique can come in handy if you suspect
that an account is being used inappropriately. You can alter the
system profile to create and keep a history file, if none was kept
before. On some systems, you can even designate a named pipe (<span class="acronym">FIFO</SPAN
>)
as the history file, thus transmitting the material to a logging
process in a manner that cannot be truncated or deleted.</P
><p class="para">Even if you were unable to preserve a copy of the history
file, but one was created and then unlinked by the intruder, you
can still gain some useful information if you act quickly enough.
The first thing you must do is to either take the system to single-user
mode, or <em class="emphasis">umount</EM
> the disk with the suspect account
(we recommend going to single-user mode). Then, you can use disk-examination
tools to look at the records on the free list. When a file is deleted,
the contents are not immediately overwritten. Instead, the data
records are added back into the freelist on disk. If they are not
reused yet (which is why you <em class="emphasis">umount</EM
> the disk
or shut the system down), you can still read the contents.</P

user accounts are configured
to make a copy of all outgoing mail in a file. If an intruder sends
mail from a user account where this feature is set (or where you
set it), this feature can provide you with potentially useful information.
In at least one case we know of, a person stealing confidential
information by using a coworker's pirated password was
exposed because of recorded email to his colleagues that he signed
with his own name!</P
><p class="para">Some systems also record a log file of mail sent and received.
This file can be kept per-user, or it may be part of the system-wide
<i class="filename">syslog</I
> audit trail. The contents of this log
can be used to track what mail has come in and left the system.
If nothing else, we have found this information to be useful when
a disk error (or human error) wipes out a whole set of mailboxes&nbsp;- the
people listed in the mail log file can be contacted to resend their
mail.</P

account can have several network configuration files that can be
edited to provide shortcuts for commands, or to assert access rights.
Sometimes, the information in these files will provide a clue as
to the activities of a malefactor. Examples include the <i class="filename">.rhosts</I

file for remote logins, and the <i class="filename">.netrc</I

for <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN

but remember: the presence of information in one of these files
may have been there prior to the incident, or it may have been planted
to throw you off.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-13622"></A
