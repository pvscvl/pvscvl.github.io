Keys are similar to computer passwords: when a piece of information
is encrypted, you need to specify the correct key to access it again.
But unlike a password program, an encryption program doesn't
compare the key you provide with the key you originally used to
encrypt the file, and grant you access if the two keys match. Instead,
an encryption program uses your key to transform the ciphertext
back into the plaintext. If you provide the correct key, you get
back your original message. If you try to decrypt a file with the
wrong key, you get garbage.[7]</P

might wonder why you need encryption if you are already using an

><p class="para">The reason for this limitation is the very difference between
computer security controls based on file permissions and passwords,
and controls based on cryptography. When you protect information

clear.&quot; It is still accessible to your system manager (or
someone else with superuser access), to a malicious computer hacker
