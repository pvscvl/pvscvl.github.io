><p class="para">Most systems for providing <span class="acronym">UNIX </SPAN

we have discussed in this book are designed to protect an individual
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

We
have also explored systems such as Kerberos and Secure <span class="acronym">RPC</SPAN

which allow a set of hosts to communicate securely in a hostile
environment.</P
><p class="para">As an alternative to protecting individual
computers on a network, many organizations have opted for a seemingly
simpler solution: protecting an organization's internal
network from external attack. </P
><p class="para">The simplest way to protect
a network of computers is with <i class="firstterm">physical isolation</I
>.
Avoid the problems of networks by not connecting your host to the
Internet and not providing dial-in modems. Nobody from the outside
will be able to attack your computers without first entering your
physical premises. Although this approach completely ignores the
damage that insiders can do, it is nevertheless a simple, straightforward
policy that has been used by most organizations for years. In many
environments, this is still the best way to approach network security&nbsp;- there
is little to be gained from connection to outside networks, and
much to lose.</P
><p class="para">Recently, however, the growth of the Internet
has made physical isolation more difficult. Employees in organizations
want email, they want access to Usenet news, and they want to browse
the World Wide Web. In addition, organizations want to publish information
about themselves on the Web. To allow partial connection to the
Internet, while retaining some amount of isolation, some organizations
are using firewalls to protect their security.</P
><p class="para">Firewalls
are powerful tools, but they should never be used <em class="emphasis">instead</EM
>
of other security measures. They should only be used <em class="emphasis">in
addition</EM

gives organizations a way to create a middle ground between networks
that are completely isolated from external networks, such as the
Internet, and those that are completely connected. Placed between
an organization's internal network and the external network,
the firewall provides a simple way to control the amount and kinds
of traffic that will pass between the two.</P
><p class="para">The term
<i class="firstterm">firewall </I
>comes from the construction industry.
When apartment houses or office buildings are built, they are often
equipped with firewalls&nbsp;- specially constructed walls that
are resistant to fire. If a fire should start in the building, it
may burn out of control in one portion, but the firewall will stop
or slow the progress of the fire until help arrives. </P
><p class="para">The
same philosophy can be applied to the protection of local area networks
of machines from outside attack. Used within an organization, a
firewall can limit the amount of damage: an intruder may break into
one set of machines, but the firewall will protect others. Erected
between an organizational network and the Internet at large, a firewall
prevents a malicious attacker who has gained control of computers
outside the organization's walls from gaining a foothold
on the inside. Firewalls seem to make sense because there is always
a &quot;fire&quot; burning somewhere on the Internet.</P

The
fundamental function of a firewall is to restrict the flow of information
between two networks. To set up your firewall, you must therefore
define what kinds of data pass and what kinds are blocked. This
is called defining your firewall's <i class="firstterm">policy</I
>.
After a policy is defined, you must then create the actual <i class="firstterm">mechanisms</I
>
that implement that policy.</P
><p class="para">There are two basic strategies
for defining firewall policy: </P
><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term">Default permit</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">With this strategy, you give the firewall the set
of conditions that will result in data being blocked. Any host or
protocol that is not covered by your policy will be passed by default.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Default deny</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">With this strategy, you describe the specific protocols
that should be allowed to cross through the firewall, and the specific
hosts that may pass data and be contacted. The rest are denied.</P
></DD
></DL
><p class="para">There are advantages and disadvantages to both default permit
and default deny. The primary advantage of default permit is that
it is easier to configure: you simply block out the protocols that
are &quot;too dangerous,&quot; and rely on your awareness
to block new dangerous protocols as they are developed (or discovered).
With default deny, you simply enable protocols as they are requested
by your users or management. Any protocol that isn't being
used by your organization might as well be blocked.</P
><p class="para">Neither
default permit nor default deny is a panacea. With both policies,
you can create a firewall that is either secure or unsecure, by
permitting (or failing to deny) &quot;dangerous&quot; protocols.&#13;</P

><p class="para">Firewalls are part
of a good defense in depth strategy. The idea is to place several
layers of protection between your machines and the potential threats.
There are some obvious threats from the outside, so you should naturally
place a firewall between the outside and your internal network(s).&#13;</P
><p class="para">Because a firewall is placed at the intersection of
two networks, it can be used for many other purposes besides simply
controlling access. For example:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Firewalls can be used to block access
to particular sites on the Internet, or to prevent certain users
or machines from accessing certain servers or services.</P

between your internal network and an external network. For example,
you could use the firewall to log the endpoints and amount of data
sent over every <span class="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN

organization and the outside world. </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A firewall can even be used to eavesdrop and record
all communications between your internal network and the outside
world. A 56KB leased line at 100% utilization passes only
605 MB/day, meaning that a week's worth of Internet
traffic can easily fit on a single 8mm digital tape. Such records
can be invaluable for tracking down network penetrations or detecting
internal subversion.[1]</P

privacy questions, and possibly legal ones as well. Investigate
these questions carefully before engaging in such monitoring.</P

location and you have a firewall for each location, you can program
the firewalls to automatically encrypt packets that are sent over
the network between them. In this way, you can use the Internet

><p class="para">Instead of using a single
gate, you can use several gates&nbsp;- one for each protocol.
This approach has the advantage of making the gates easier to administer.
However, this approach also increases the number of machines that
must be carefully watched for unusual activity. A simpler approach
might be to have a single gate, but to create individual servers
within your organization's network for specific services
such as mail, Usenet, World Wide Web, and so forth.</P

><p class="para">Instead of putting
all your organization's machines on a single local network,
you can separate your installation into sets of independent local
area networks. These networks can communicate through gateway machines,
routers, or full-blown firewalls. Alternatively, they can communicate
with each other through independent links to the Internet, using
an appropriate encryption system to prevent eavesdropping by your
<span class="acronym">ISP</SPAN
> and others.</P
><p class="para">Internal firewalls
make a lot of sense in a large organization. After all, there is
no reason to allow your research scientists any privileged access
to a computer that is used for accounting, or to allow people who
are sitting in front of data-entry terminals to try their hand at
breaking into the research and development department's
file servers. With an internal firewall, you can place extra security
where needed.</P
><p class="para">The goal in setting up independent internal
networks should be to minimize the damage that will take place if
one of your internal networks is compromised, either by an intruder
or, more likely, by an insider. By practicing stringent isolation,
you can reduce the chances that an attacker will be able to use
a foothold in one network as a beachhead for breaking into others.</P
><p class="para">A firewall designed for use within an organization is very
similar to one that is used to protect an organization against external
threats. However, because the same management team and structure
may be responsible for many networks within an organization, there
is a great temptation to share information or services via an internal
firewall, when such information services should in fact be blocked.</P

internal networks:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If you use <span class="acronym">NIS</SPAN
