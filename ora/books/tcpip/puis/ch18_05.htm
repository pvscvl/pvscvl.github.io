><p class="para">Most Web browsers can be configured so that certain &quot;helper&quot;
applications are automatically run when files of particular type
are downloaded from the net. Although this is a good way to provide
extensibility, you should not configure your Web browser so that
programs downloaded from the net are automatically executed. Doing
so poses a profound risk, because it provides a way for outsiders
to run programs on your computer without your explicit permission.
(For example, a program could be embedded in an <span class="acronym">HTML</SPAN

page as an included &quot;image.&quot;)</P

><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Do not configure your Web browser to automatically

Java programming language. The creators
of Java have gone to great lengths to make sure that a program written
in Java cannot harm the computer on which it is running. Whether
or not the creators are correct remains to be seen. However, we
have our doubts based on past experiences with complex software.
As this book goes to press, there is no indication that Java has
any significant protections against denial of service attacks. Also,
as this book goes to press, several serious security bugs in Sun's
and Netscape's implementations of Java have been reported.</P

>Most
users run Web browsers that are provided by third parties with whom
the user has no formal relationship or signed contract. Instead,
users are asked to click buttons that say &quot;<span class="acronym">ACCEPT</SPAN

to signify their acceptance of the terms of a non-negotiable license
agreement. These license agreements limit the liability of the companies
that distribute the software.</P
><p class="para">Individuals and organizations using such software should carefully
read the license agreements. They rarely do. In particular, consider
these two clauses in the Netscape Navigator 2.02b license. Interestingly,
these are the only two paragraphs of the Netscape license agreement
that are in all capital letters. They must be important</P

><p class="para">What these paragraphs mean is that Netscape Communications
disclaims any liability for anything that its Navigator software
might do.[5] This means that
the Navigator could scan your computer's disks for interesting
information and send it, encrypted, to a Netscape Commerce Server,
when it is sent an appropriate command. We don't think
that Navigator actually has this code compiled into it, but we don't
know, because Netscape has not published the source code for either
its Navigator or Commerce Server. (Netscape is not alone in keeping
its source code secret.)</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[5] We don't mean to pick on Netscape
here. Other software comes with similar license agreements. Netscape
is used merely as an illustrative example because of its popularity
when this book was being written.</P

Script, renamed Java Script, programming language. A feature in
a beta version of the browser allowed any server to query the Web
browser for the list of <span class="acronym">URLS</SPAN
> that had been visited
by the user.[6]
As <span class="acronym">URLS</SPAN

security issues. Although this feature has been taken out of Navigator,
it is possible that it could be reintroduced in the future through
the use of a programming language such as Java.</P

><p class="para">Indeed, programming languages such as Java create a whole
new layer of security issues. Java is a programming language that
is designed to allow the downloading of applications over the World
Wide Web. Java is designed to be secure: the programs are run on
a virtual machine, and they are not run unless they are approved
by a &quot;verifier&quot; on the Web browser. In the initial
implementation of Java for Web browsers, programs written in Java
are permitted to access the network or to touch the user's
filesystem, but not both. Programs that can touch the filesystem
are permitted to read any file, but only to write in a specially
predetermined directory.</P
><p class="para">Unfortunately, Java's current security model is rather
restrictive, and it is therefore quite likely that users will demand
a more open model that gives Java programs more access to a user's
filesystems <i class="systemitem">and</I
> the
network. This will probably produce a new round of security problems.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-25635"></A
