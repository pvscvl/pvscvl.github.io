><p class="para">Suppose you're a system administrator and John Q.
Random is there with you in your office. Suddenly, an alert window
pops up on your display, triggered by a Swatch rule monitoring the
<i class="filename">syslog</I
> output. The <i class="filename">syslog </I
>message
has indicated that John Q. Random has logged in and has used the
<kbd class="command">su</KBD
> command to become <i class="filename">root</I
>.</P
><p class="para">The user must be an intruder&nbsp;- an intruder who has
become <i class="systemitem">root! </I
></P
><p class="para">Fortunately, in one of the windows on your terminal you have
a superuser shell. You decide that the best course of action is
to bring your system to an immediate halt. To do so, you execute
the commands:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen"># <b class="emphasis.bold">sync</B
> 
# <b class="emphasis.bold">/etc/init 0</B
></PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Alternatively, you can send a <span class="acronym">TERM</SPAN
> signal
to the init process:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen"># <b class="emphasis.bold">sync</B
>
# <b class="emphasis.bold">kill -TERM 1</B
></PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">This method is not the recommended procedure on System V systems,
but is required on <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> systems.</P
><p class="para">Your decision to halt the system was based on the fact that
you had no idea who this intruder was or what he was doing, and
the fact that the intruder had become the superuser. After the intruder
is the superuser, you don't know what parts of the operating
system he is modifying, if any.</P
><p class="para">For example, the intruder may be replacing system programs
and destroying log files. You decide that the best thing you can
do is to shut the system down and go to a protected terminal where
you know that no other intruder is going to be interfering with
the system while you figure out what's going on.</P
><p class="para">The next step is to get a printed copy of all of the necessary
logs that you may have available (e.g., console logs and printed
copies of network logs), and to examine these logs to try to get
an idea of what the unauthorized intruder has done. You will also
want to see if anything unusual has happened on the system since
the intruder logged in. These logs may give you a hint as to what
programs the intruder was running and what actions the intruder
took. Be sure to initial and timestamp these printouts.</P
><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Do not </EM
>confine your examination to today's
logs. If the intruder is now logged in as <i class="filename">root</I
>, he may have also
been on the system under another account name earlier. If your logs
go back for a few days, examine the older versions as well. If they
are on your backup tapes, consider retrieving them from the tapes.</P
><p class="para">If the break-in is something that you wish to pursue further&nbsp;- possibly
with law enforcement&nbsp;- be sure to do a complete backup of
the system to tape. This way, you'll have evidence in the
form of the corrupted system. Also, save copies of the logs. Keep
a written log of everything you've done and are about to
do, and be sure to write the time of day along with each notation.</P
><p class="para">The next step is to determine how the intruder got in and
then to make sure the intruder can't get in again. Examine
the entire system. Check the permissions and the modes on all your
files. Scan for new <span class="acronym">SUID</SPAN
> or <span class="acronym">SGID</SPAN
>
files. Look for additions in <i class="filename">/etc/passwd</I
>. If you
have constructed checklists of your program directories, rerun them
to look for any changes.</P
><p class="para">Remember: the intruder may <em class="emphasis">not</EM
> be an
outsider! The majority of major incidents occur from inside the
organization, either from someone with current access or someone
who recently had legitimate access. When you perform your evaluation,
don't forget to consider the case that the behavior you
saw coming from a user account was not someone breaking a password
and coming in from outside, but was someone on the inside who broke
the password, or perhaps it was the real account owner herself!</P
><p class="para">Only after performing all these steps, and checking all this
information, should you bring the system back up.</P

>If your system is compromised, don't
trust anything that is online. If you discover changes in files
on your system that seem suspicious, don't believe anything
that your system tells you, because a good system cracker can change
anything on the computer. This may seem extreme, but it is probably
better to spend a little extra time restoring files and playing
detective now than it would be to replay the entire incident when
the intruder gets in again.</P
><p class="para">Remember, an attacker who becomes the superuser on your computer
can do <em class="emphasis">anything</EM
> to it, change <em class="emphasis">any</EM
>
byte on the hard disk. The attacker can compile and install new
versions of any system program&nbsp;- so there might be changes,
but your standard utilities might not tell you about them. The attacker
can patch the kernel that the computer is running, possibly disabling
security features that you have previously enabled. The attacker
can even open the raw disk devices for reading and writing. Essentially,
attackers who becomes the superuser can warp your system to their
liking&nbsp;- if they have sufficient skill, motivation, and time.
Often, they don't need (or have) great skill. Instead,
they have access to toolkits put together by others with more skill.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-34052"></A
>For example, suppose
you discover a change in a file and do an ls -l or an ls
-lt. The modification time you see printed for the file
may not be the actual modification time of the file. There are at
least four ways for an attacker to modify the time that is displayed
by this command, all of which have been used in actual system attacks:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The attacker could write a program
that changes the modification time of the file using the <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-34058"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-34060"></A
>
<i class="filename">utimes</I
>()<i class="filename"></I
> system call.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The attacker could have altered the system clock
by using the <kbd class="command">date</KBD
> command. The attacker could then modify your files
and, finally, reset the date back again. This technique has the
advantage for the attacker that the inode access and creation times
also get set.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The attacker could write to the raw disk, changing
saved values of <em class="emphasis">any</EM
> stored time.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The attacker could have modified the <kbd class="command">ls</KBD
> command
to show a predetermined modification time whenever this file is
examined.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">The only limit to the powers of an attacker who has gained
superuser status is that the attacker cannot change something that
has been <em class="emphasis">printed</EM
> on a line printer or a hardcopy
terminal. For this reason, if you have a logging facility that logs
whenever the date is changed, you might consider having the log
made to a hardcopy terminal or to another computer. Then, be sure
to examine this log on a regular basis.</P
><p class="para">It is also the case that we recommend that you have a bootable
copy of your operating system on a removable disk pack so, when
needed, you can boot from a known good copy of the system and do
your examination of the system with uncorrupted tools. Coupled with
a database of message digests of unmodified files such as that produced
by a tool such as Tripwire, you should be able to find anything
that was modified on your system.</P
