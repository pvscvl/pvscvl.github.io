>The next step in handling a break-in
is to restore the system to a working state. How quickly you must
be back in operation, and what you intend to do about the break-in
in the long term, will determine when and how you do this step.</P
><p class="para">In general you have a few options about how to proceed from
this point:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Investigate until you have determined
how the break-in happened, and when. Close up the holes and restore
the system to the state it was prior to the break-in.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Simply patch and repair whatever you think may have
been related to the break-in. Then restore the system to operation
with heightened monitoring.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Do a quick scan and cleanup, and put the system
back into operation.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Call in law enforcement before you do anything else
so they can start an investigation.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Do nothing whatsoever.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">You want to get whatever assurance you can that you have restored
anything damaged on the system, and fixed whatever it was that allowed
the intruder in. Then, if you have been keeping good backups, you
can restore the system to a working state.</P
><p class="para">The difficulty with determining what failed and allowed an
intruder in is complicated by the fact that there is usually little
data in the logs to show what happened, and there are few things
you can execute to reverse-engineer the break-in. Most break-ins
seem to result from either a compromised user password (suspect
this especially if you find that the intruders have installed a
sniffer on your system), or a bug. If it is a bug, you may have
difficulty determining what it is, especially if it is a new one
that has not been widely exploited. If you suspect that it is a
bug in some system software, you can try contacting your vendor
to see if you can get some assistance there. In some cases it helps
if you have a maintenance contract or are a major customer.</P
><p class="para">Another avenue you can explore is to contact the <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-34100"></A
>
<span class="acronym">FIRST</SPAN
> team appropriate for your
site. Teams in <span class="acronym">FIRST</SPAN
> often have some insight
into current break-ins, largely because they see so many reports
of them. Contacting a representative from one of the teams may result
in some good advice for things to check before you put your system
back into operation. However, many teams have rules of operation
that prevent them from giving too much explicit information about
active vulnerabilities until the appropriate vendors have announced
a fix. Thus, you may not be able to get complete information from
this source.</P
><p class="para">As a possible last resort, you might consult recent postings
to the <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-34105"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-34108"></A
>
Usenet security groups, and to some of the
current <span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
> sites and mailing lists. Often, current
vulnerabilities are discussed in some detail in these locations.
This is a mixed blessing, because not only does this provide you
with some valuable information to protect (or restore) your site,
but it also often provides details to hacker wannabes who are looking
for ways to break into systems. It is also the case that we have
seen incorrect and even dangerous advice and analysis given in some
of these forums. Therefore, be very wary of what you read, and consider
these sources as a last resort.</P
