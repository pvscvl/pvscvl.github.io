>Every
potential computer user should undergo fundamental education in
security policy as a matter of course. At the least, this education
should include procedures for password selection and use, physical
access to computers, backup procedures, dial-in policies, and the
policies for divulging information over the telephone. Executives
should not be excluded from these classes because of their status&nbsp;- they
are as likely (or more likely) as other personnel to pick poor passwords
and commit other errors. They, too, must demonstrate their commitment
to security: security consciousness flows from the top down, not
the other way.</P
><p class="para">Education should include written materials
and a copy of the computer-use policy. The education should include
discussion of appropriate and inappropriate use of the computers
and networks, personal use of computing equipment (during and after
hours), policy on ownership and use of electronic mail, and policies
on the import and export of software and papers. Penalties for violations
of these policies should also be detailed.</P
><p class="para">All users
should sign a form acknowledging the receipt of this information,
and their acceptance of its restrictions. These forms should be
retained. Later, if any question arises as to whether the employee
was given prior warning about what was allowed, there will be proof.</P

with refresher information about security and appropriate use of
the computers. This retraining is an opportunity to explain good
practice, remind users of current threats and their consequences,
and provide a forum to air questions and concerns.</P
><p class="para">Your
staff should also be given adequate opportunities for ongoing training.
This training should include support to attend professional conferences
and seminars, to subscribe to professional and trade periodicals,
and to obtain reference books and other training materials. Your
staff must also be given sufficient time to make use of the material,
and positive incentives to master it.</P
><p class="para">Coupled with periodic
education, you may wish to employ various methods of continuing
awareness. These methods could include putting up posters or notices
about good practice,[1] having periodic messages of
the day with tips and reminders, having an &quot;Awareness Day&quot;
every few months, or having other events to keep security from fading
into the background.</P

periodically. A poster or notice that has not changed in many months
becomes invisible.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Of course, the nature of your organization,
the level of threat and possible loss, and the size and nature of
your user population should all be factored into your plans. The
cost of awareness activities should also be considered and budgeted
in advance.</P

>The performance of your staff should
be reviewed periodically. In particular, the staff should be given
credit and rewarded for professional growth and good practice. At

constructive manner. You must encourage staff members to increase
their abilities and enhance their understanding.</P
><p class="para">You
also want to avoid creating situations in which staff members feel
overworked, underappreciated, or ignored. Creating such a working
environment can lead to carelessness and a lack of interest in protecting
the interests of the organization. The staff could also leave for
better opportunities. Or worse, the staff could become involved
in acts of disruption as a matter of revenge. <a class="email" href="mailto:overtimeOvertime must" be an exception and not the rule, and all employees-especially those in critical positions-must be given adequate holiday and vacation time."><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17122"></A

><p class="para">In general, users with privileges
should be monitored for signs of excessive stress, personal problems,
or other indications of difficulties. Identifying such problems
and providing help, where possible, is at the very least humane.
Such practice is also a way to preserve valuable resources&nbsp;- the
users themselves, and the resources to which they have access. A
user under considerable financial or personal stress might spontaneously
take some action that he would never consider under more normal
situations...and that action might be damaging to your operations.</P

>Ensure
that auditing of access to equipment and data is enabled, and is
monitored. Furthermore, ensure that anyone with such access knows
that auditing is enabled. Many instances of computer abuse are spontaneous
in nature. If a possible malefactor knows that the activity and
access are logged, he might be discouraged in his actions.</P

carefully the time-tested principles of least privilege and separation
of duties. These should be employed wherever practical in your operations.</P
><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term">Least privilege</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17142"></A
>This principle
states that you give each person the minimum access necessary to
do his or her job. This restricted access is both logical (access
to accounts, networks, programs) and physical (access to computers,
backup tapes, and other peripherals). If every user has accounts
on every system and has physical access to everything, then all
users are roughly equivalent in level of threat.</P

><dt class="term">Separation of duties </DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17148"></A
>This
principle states that you should carefully separate duties so that
people involved in checking for inappropriate use are not also capable
of making such inappropriate use. Thus, having all the security
functions and audit responsibilities reside in the same person is
dangerous. This practice can lead to a case in which the person
may violate security policy and commit prohibited acts, yet in which
no other person sees the audit trail to be alerted to the problem.</P

></H4
><p class="para">No
one in an organization should be irreplaceable, because no human
is immortal. If your organization depends on the ongoing performance
of a key employee, then your organization is at risk.</P
><p class="para">Organizations
cannot help but have key employees. To be secure, organizations
should have written policies and plans established for unexpected
illness or departure.</P
><p class="para">In one case that we are familiar
with, a small company with 100 employees had spent more than 10
years developing its own custom-written accounting and order entry
system. The system was written in a programming language that was
not readily known, originally provided by a company that had possibly
gone out of business. Two people understood the organization's
system: the <span class="acronym">MIS</SPAN
> director and her programmer.
These two people were responsible for making changes to the account
system's programs, preparing annual reports, repairing
computer equipment when it broke, and even performing backups (which
were stored, off-site, at the <span class="acronym">MIS</SPAN
> director's
home office).</P
><p class="para">What would happen if the <span class="acronym">MIS</SPAN
>
director and her programmer were killed one day in a car accident
on their way to meet with a vendor? What would happen if the <span class="acronym">MIS</SPAN
>
director were offered a better job, at twice the salary?</P
><p class="para">That
key personnel are irreplaceable is one of the real costs associated
with computer systems &nbsp;- one that is rarely appreciated by
an organization's senior management. The drawbacks of this
case illustrate one more compelling reason to use off-the-shelf
software, and to have established written policies and procedures,
so that a newly hired replacement can easily fill another's
shoes.</P

>Personnel leave,
sometimes on their own, and sometimes involuntarily. In either case,
you should have a defined set of actions for how to handle the departure.
This procedure should include shutting down accounts; forwarding
email; changing critical passwords, phone numbers, and combinations;
and otherwise removing access to your systems.</P
><p class="para">In some
environments, this suggestion may be too drastic. In the case of
a university, for instance, graduated students might be allowed
to keep accounts active for months or years after they leave. In
such cases, you must determine exactly what access is to be allowed
and what access is to be disallowed. Make certain that the personnel
involved know exactly what the limits are.</P
><p class="para">In other
environments, a departure is quite sudden and dramatic. Someone
may show up at work, only to find the locks changed and a security
guard waiting with a box containing everything that was in the user's
desk drawers. The account has already been deleted; all system passwords
have been changed; and the user's office phone number is
no longer assigned. This form of separation management is quite
common in financial service industries, and is understood to be
part of the job.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17180"></A
