computer security is a series of technical solutions
to non-technical problems. You can spend an unlimited amount of
time, money, and effort on computer security, but you will never
quite solve the problem of accidental data loss or intentional disruption
of your activities. Given the right set of circumstances&nbsp;- software
bugs, accidents, mistakes, bad luck, bad weather, or a motivated
and well-equipped attacker&nbsp;- any computer can be compromised,
rendered useless, or worse.</P
><p class="para">The job of the security professional is to help organizations
decide how much time and money need to be spent on security. Another
part of that job is to make sure that organizations have policies,
guidelines, and procedures in place so that the money spent is spent
well. And finally, the professional needs to audit the system to
ensure that the appropriate controls are implemented correctly to
achieve the policy's goals. Thus, practical security is
really a question of management and administration more than it
is one of technical skill. Consequently, security must be a priority
of your firm's management.</P
><p class="para">This book divides the process of security planning into six
discrete steps:</P

analysis, and policy-making. Implementation is covered by many of
the chapters of this book. Audit is described in <a class="xref" href="ch10_01.htm" title="Auditing and Logging">Chapter 10, <cite class="chapter">Auditing and Logging</CITE

><p class="para">There are two critical principles implicit in effective policy
and security planning:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1231"></A
>Policy and security awareness must be driven from
the top down in the organization. Security concerns and awareness
by the users are important, but they cannot build or sustain an
effective culture of security. Instead, the head(s) of the organization
must treat security as important, and abide by all the same rules
and regulations as everyone else.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Effective computer security means protecting <em class="emphasis">information</EM
>.
All plans, policies and procedures should reflect the need to protect
information in whatever form it takes. Proprietary data does not
become worthless when it is on a printout or is faxed to another
site instead of contained in a disk file. Customer confidential
information does not suddenly lose its value because it is recited
on the phone between two users instead of contained within an email
message. The information should be protected no matter what its
form.</P

><p class="para">A computer is secure if it behaves the way that you expect
it will.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1241"></A
>There are many different kinds
of computer security, and many different definitions. Rather than
present a formal definition, this book takes the practical approach
and discusses the categories of protection you should consider.
We believe that secure computers are usable computers, and, likewise,
that computers that cannot be used, for whatever the reason, are
not very secure.</P
><p class="para">Within this broad definition, there are many different kinds
of security that both users and administrators of computer systems
need to be concerned about:</P
><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term">Confidentiality </DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1249"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1251"></A
>Protecting
information from being read or copied by anyone who has not been
explicitly authorized by the owner of that information. This type
of security includes not only protecting the information in toto,
but also protecting individual pieces of information that may seem
harmless by themselves but that can be used to infer other confidential
information.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Data integrity </DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1258"></A
>Protecting information
(including programs) from being deleted or altered in any way without
the permission of the owner of that information. Information to
be protected also includes items such as accounting records, backup
tapes, file creation times, and documentation.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Availability </DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1264"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1267"></A
>Protecting your services so they're
not degraded or made unavailable (crashed) without authorization.
If the system is unavailable when an authorized user needs it, the
result can be as bad as having the information that resides on the
system deleted.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Consistency </DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1274"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1276"></A
>Making sure that the system behaves as expected by
the authorized users. If software or hardware suddenly starts behaving
radically differently from the way it used to behave, especially
after an upgrade or a bug fix, a disaster could occur. Imagine if
your <i class="filename">ls</I
> command occasionally deleted files
instead of listing them! This type of security can also be considered
as ensuring the <em class="emphasis">correctness</EM
> of the data and
software you use.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Control </DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1285"></A
>Regulating
access to your system. If unknown and unauthorized individuals (or
software) are found on your system, they can create a big problem.
You must worry about how they got in, what they might have done,
and who or what else has also accessed your system. Recovering from
such episodes can require considerable time and expense for rebuilding
and reinstalling your system, and verifying that nothing important
has been changed or disclosed&nbsp;- even if nothing actually
happened.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Audit </DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1291"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1294"></A
>As well as worrying about unauthorized users,
authorized users sometimes make mistakes, or even commit malicious
acts. In such cases, you need to determine what was done, by whom,
and what was affected. The only way to achieve these results is
by having some incorruptible record of activity on your system that
positively identifies the actors and actions involved. In some critical
applications, the audit trail may be extensive enough to allow &quot;undo&quot;
operations to help restore the system to a correct state.</P
></DD
></DL
><p class="para">Although all of these aspects of security above are important,
different organizations will view each with a different amount of
importance. This variance is because different organizations have
different security concerns, and must set their priorities and policies
accordingly. For example:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">In a <em class="emphasis">banking environment</EM
>,
integrity and auditability are usually the most critical concerns,
while confidentiality and availability are the next in importance.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">In a <em class="emphasis">national defense-related system that
processes classified information</EM
>, confidentiality may
come first, and availability last.[1]</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[1] In some highly
classified environments, officials would prefer to blow up a building
rather than allow an attacker to gain access to the information
contained within that building's walls.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">In a <em class="emphasis">university</EM
>, integrity
and availability may be the most important requirements. The priority
is that students be able to work on their papers, rather than tracking
the precise times that students accessed their accounts.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">If you are a security administrator, you need to thoroughly
understand the needs of your operational environment and users.
You then need to define your procedures accordingly. Not everything
we describe in this book will be appropriate in every environment.</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1314"></A
>Security professionals generally
don't refer to a computer system as being &quot;secure&quot;
or &quot;unsecure.&quot;[2] Instead, we use the
word &quot;trust&quot; to describe our level of confidence
that a computer system will behave as expected. This acknowledges
that absolute security can never be present. We can only try to
approach it by developing enough trust in the overall configuration
to warrant using it for critical applications.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[2] We use the term
<em class="emphasis">unsecure</EM
> to mean having weak security, and
<em class="emphasis">insecure</EM
> to describe the state of mind of people
running unsecure systems.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Developing adequate trust in your computer systems requires
careful thought and planning. Decisions should be based on sound
policy decisions and risk analysis. In the remainder of this chapter,
we&quot;ll discuss the general procedure for creating workable
security plans and policies. The topic is too big, however, for
us to provide an in-depth treatment:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If you are at a company, university,
or government agency, we suggest that you contact your internal
audit and/or risk management department for additional
help (they may already have some plans and policies in place that
you should know about). You can also learn more about this topic
by consulting some of the works referenced in <a class="xref" href="appd_01.htm" title="Paper Sources">Appendix D, <cite class="appendix">Paper Sources</CITE
></A
>.
 You may also wish to enlist a consulting firm. For
example, many large accounting and audit firms now have teams of
professionals that can evaluate the security of computer installations.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If you are with a smaller institution or are dealing
with a personal machine, you may decide that we cover these issues
in greater detail than you actually need. Nevertheless, the information
contained in this chapter will help guide you in setting your priorities.</P
