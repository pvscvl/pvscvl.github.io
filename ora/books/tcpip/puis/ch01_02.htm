>For most people, a
computer is a tool for solving problems. When running a word processor,
a computer becomes a machine for arranging words and ideas. With
a spreadsheet, the computer is a financial planning machine, one
that is vastly more powerful than a pocket calculator. Connected
to an electronic network, a computer becomes part of a powerful
communications system.</P
><p class="para">At the heart of every computer is a master set of programs
called the operating system. This is the software that controls
the computer's input/output systems such as keyboards
and disk drives, and that loads and runs other programs. The operating
system is also a set of mechanisms and policies that help define
controlled sharing of system resources.</P
><p class="para">Along with the operating system is a large set of standard
utility programs for performing common functions such as copying
files and listing the contents of directories. Although these programs
are not technically part of the operating system, they can have
a dramatic impact on a computer system's security.</P
><p class="para">All of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> can be divided into three parts:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-633"></A
>
kernel,
or the heart of the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> system, is the operating
system. The kernel is a special program that is loaded into the
computer when it is first turned on. The kernel controls all of
the computer's input and output systems; it allows multiple
programs to run at the same time, and it allocates the system's
time and memory among them. The kernel includes the filesystem,
which controls how files and directories are stored on the computer's
hard disk. The filesystem is the main mechanism by which computer
security is enforced. Some modern versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
allow user programs to load additional modules, such as device drivers,
into the kernel after the system starts running.</P

><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Standard <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-639"></A

utility
programs are run by users and by the system. Some programs are small
and serve a single function&nbsp;- for example, <kbd class="command">/bin/ls</KBD
>lists files and <kbd class="command">/bin/cp </KBD
>copies them.
Other programs are large and perform many functions&nbsp;- for
example, <kbd class="command">/bin/sh</KBD
> and <kbd class="command">/bin/csh</KBD

shells that
process user commands, are themselves programming languages.</P

database files, most of which are relatively small, are used by
a variety of programs on the system. One file, <i class="filename">/etc/passwd</I
>,
contains the master list of every user on the system. Another file,
<i class="filename">/etc/group</I
>, describes groups of users with
similar access rights.</P

>Security policy, which determines how the computer
is run with respect to the users and system administration. Policy
plays as important a role in determining your computer's
security as the operating system software. A computer that is operated
without regard to security cannot be trusted, even if it is equipped
with the most sophisticated and security-conscious software. For
this reason, establishing and codifying policy plays a very important
role in the overall process of operating a secure system. This is
discussed further in <a class="xref" href="ch02_01.htm" title="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2</A
>.</P
