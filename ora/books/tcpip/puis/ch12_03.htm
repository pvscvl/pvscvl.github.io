>Obviously,
as described above, there is a strong overlap between physical security
and data privacy and integrity. Indeed, the goal of some attacks
is not the physical destruction of your computer system but the
penetration and removal (or copying) of the sensitive information
it contains. This section explores several different types of attacks
on data and discusses approaches for protecting against these attacks.</P

<em class="emphasis">eavesdropping</EM
>
is perhaps the most sinister type of data piracy. Even with modest
equipment, an eavesdropper can make a complete transcript of a victim's
actions&nbsp;- every keystroke, and every piece of information
viewed on a screen or sent to a printer. The victim, meanwhile,
usually knows nothing of the attacker's presence, and blithely
goes about his or her work, revealing not only sensitive information,
but the passwords and procedures necessary for obtaining even more.</P
><p class="para">In many cases, you cannot possibly know if you're
being monitored. Sometimes you will learn of an eavesdropper's
presence when the attacker attempts to make use of the information
obtained: often, by then, you cannot prevent significant damage.
With care and vigilance, however, you can significantly decrease
the risk of being monitored.</P

their very nature, electrical wires are prime candidates for eavesdropping
(hence the name wiretapping). An attacker can follow an entire conversation
over a pair of wires with a simple splice&nbsp;- sometimes he

most voice and RS-232 communications.</P

a packet comes in from a computer connected to the hub that doesn't
match what the hub has been told is correct, it can raise an alarm

of Ethernet spoofing.</P
><p class="para">Increasingly, large organizations
are turning to switched 10Base-T hubs. These hubs do not rebroadcast
all traffic to all ports, as if they were on a shared Ethernet;
instead, they determine the hardware address of each machine on
each line, and only send a computer the packets that it should receive.
Switching 10Base-T hubs are sold as a tool for increasing the capacity
of 10Base-T networks, but they also improve the security of these
networks by minimizing the potential for eavesdropping.</P

kind of tapping that security agencies (in the U.S., these agencies
include the <span class="acronym">FBI</SPAN

<span class="acronym">NSA</SPAN

1980s, a certification system called <span class="acronym">TEMPEST</SPAN

was developed in the U.S. to rate the susceptibility of computer
equipment to such monitoring. Computers that are <span class="acronym">TEMPEST</SPAN

are generally substantially less susceptible to radio monitoring
than computers that are not, but they are usually more expensive

<span class="acronym">TEMPEST</SPAN

the possibility of electronic eavesdropping by radio should not
be discounted. Performing such eavesdropping is much easier than
it would seem at first. For example, the original Heathkit H19 terminal
transmitted a radio signal so strong that it could be picked up
simply by placing an ordinary television set on the same table as
the H19 terminal. All of the characters from the terminal's
screen were plainly visible on the television set's screen.
In another case, information from an H19 on one floor of a house
could be read on a television placed on another floor.</P

a prerequisite of any computer operation&nbsp;- secure or otherwise&nbsp;- but
the information stored on backup tapes is extremely vulnerable.
When the information is stored on a computer, the operating system's

hard disks pose a unique problem for
media sanitizing because of the large amount of hidden and reserved
storage. A typical 1-gigabyte hard disk may have as much as 400
megabytes of additional storage; some of this storage is used for
media testing and bad-block remapping, but much of it is unused
during normal operations. With special software, you can access
this reserved storage area; you could even install &quot;hard
disk viruses&quot; that can reprogram a hard disk controller,
take over the computer's peripheral bus and transfer data
between two devices, or feed faulty data to the host computer. For
these reasons, hard disks must be sanitized with special software
that is specially written for each particular disk drive's
model number and revision level.</P

erasing is necessary to eliminate your data. But be careful: as
the area of recording becomes smaller and smaller, modern hard disks

>As a last resort, you can physically destroy your
backup tapes and disks before you throw them out. Unfortunately,
physical destruction is getting harder and harder to do. While incinerators
do a remarkably good job destroying tapes, stringent environmental
regulations have forced many organizations to abandon this practice.
Organizations have likewise had to give up acid baths. Until recently,
crushing was preferred for hard disk drives and disk packs. But
as disk densities get higher and higher, disk drives must be crushed
into smaller and smaller pieces to frustrate laboratory analysis
of the resulting material. As a result, physical destruction is
losing in popularity when compared with software-based techniques
for declassifying or sanitizing computer media.</P
><p class="para">If you

administrator, you have an additional responsibility to sanitize
your backup tapes before you dispose of them. Although you may not

the tapes, your users may have been storing such information without
your knowledge.</P
><p class="para">One common sanitizing method involves
<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16715"></A

overwriting the entire tape.
If you are dealing with highly confidential or security-related
materials, you may wish to overwrite the disk or tape several times,
because data can be recovered from tapes that have been overwritten
only once. Commonly, tapes are overwritten three times&nbsp;- once
with blocks of 0s, then with blocks of 1s, and then with random
numbers. Finally, the tape may be degaussed&nbsp;- or run through
a bandsaw several times to reduce it to thousands of tiny pieces
of plastic. We recommend that you thoroughly sanitize all media

the last section, we discussed the importance of erasing magnetic
media before disposing of it. However, that media is not the only
material that should be carefully &quot;sanitized&quot;
before disposal. Other material that may find its way into the trash
may contain information that is useful to crackers or competitors.
This includes printouts of software (including incomplete versions),
memos, design documents, preliminary code, planning documents, internal
newsletters, company phonebooks, manuals, and other material.</P
><p class="para">That some program printouts might be used against you is obvious,

Sound farfetched? Think again&nbsp;- there are numerous stories
of such social engineering. The more internal information an outsider
has, the more easily he can obtain sensitive information. By knowing
the names, office numbers, and extensions of company officials and
their staff, he can easily convince an overworked and undertrained
operator that he needs to violate the written policy&nbsp;- or
incur the wrath of the &quot;vice president&quot;&nbsp;- on

computers, serial numbers, patch levels, and other information.
It may include hostnames, IP numbers, account names, and other information
critical to an attacker. We have heard of some firms disposing of

trashing&quot;
is one such way. After hours, someone intent on breaking your security
could be rummaging through your dumpster, looking for useful information.
In one case we heard recounted, a &quot;diver&quot; dressed
up as a street person (letting his beard grow a bit and not bathing
for a few days), splashed a little cheap booze on himself, half-filled
a mesh bag with empty soda cans, and went to work. As he went from
dumpster to dumpster in an industrial office park, he was effectively
invisible: busy and well-paid executives seem to see through the
homeless and unfortunate. If someone began to approach him, he would
pluck invisible bugs from his shirt and talk loudly to himself.
In the one case where he was accosted by a security guard, he was
able to the convince the guard to let him continue looking for &quot;cans&quot;
for spare change. He even panhandled the guard to give him $5
for a meal!</P
