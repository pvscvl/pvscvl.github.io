>You
are free to contact law-enforcement personnel any time you believe
that someone has broken a criminal statute. You start the process
by making a formal complaint to a law-enforcement agency. A prosecutor
will likely decide if the allegations should be investigated and
what (if any) charges should be filed.</P
><p class="para">In some cases
(perhaps a majority of them), criminal investigation will not help
your situation. If the perpetrators have left little trace of their
activity and the activity is not likely to recur, or if the perpetrators
are entering your system through a computer in a foreign country,
you are not likely to trace or arrest the individuals involved.
Many experienced computer intruders will leave little tracing evidence
behind.[2]</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[2] Although few computer intruders are as clever
as they believe themselves to be.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">There
is no guarantee that a criminal investigation will ever result from
a complaint that you file. The prosecutor involved (Federal, state,
or local) will need to decide which, if any, laws have been broken,
the seriousness of the crime, the availability of trained investigators,
and the probability of a conviction. Remember that the criminal
justice system is very overloaded; new investigations are started
only for very severe violations of the law or for cases that warrant
special treatment. A case in which $200,000 worth of data
is destroyed is more likely to be investigated than is a case in
which someone is repeatedly trying to break the password of your
home computer.</P
><p class="para">Investigations can also place you in
an uncomfortable and possibly dangerous position. If unknown parties
are continuing to break into your system by remote means, law-enforcement
authorities may ask you to leave your system open, thus allowing
the investigators to trace the connection and gather evidence for
an arrest. Unfortunately, if you leave your system open after discovering
that it is being misused, and the perpetrator uses your system to
break into or damage another system elsewhere, you may be the target
of a third-party lawsuit. Cooperating with law-enforcement agents
is not a sufficient shield from such liability. Before putting yourself
at risk in this way, you should discuss alternatives with your lawyer.</P

>One
of the first things you must decide is to whom you should report
the crime. Usually, you should deal with local or state authorities,
if at all possible. Every state currently has laws against some
sort of computer crime. If your local law-enforcement personnel
believe that the crime is more appropriately investigated by the
Federal government, they will suggest that you contact Federal authorities.</P
><p class="para">You cannot be sure whether your problem will receive
more attention from local authorities or from Federal authorities.
Local authorities may be more responsive because you are not as
likely to be competing with a large number of other cases (as frequently
occurs at the Federal level). Local authorities may also be more
likely to be interested in your problems, no matter how small the
problems may be. At the same time, local authorities may be reluctant
to take on high-tech investigations where they have little expertise.[3] Many
Federal agencies have expertise that can be brought in quickly to
help deal with a problem. One key difference is that investigation
and prosecution of juveniles is more likely to be done by state
authorities than by Federal authorities.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[3] Although in some venues, there are <em class="emphasis">very</EM

experienced local law-enforcement officers, and they may be more
experienced than a typical Federal officer.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Some local
law-enforcement agencies may be reluctant to seek outside help or
to bring in Federal agents. This may keep your particular case from
being investigated properly.</P
><p class="para">In many areas, because
the local authorities do not have the expertise or background necessary
to investigate and prosecute computer-related crimes, you may find
that they must depend on you for your expertise. In many cases,
you will be involved with the investigation on an ongoing basis&nbsp;- possibly
to a great extent. You may or may not consider this a productive
use of your time.</P
><p class="para">Our best advice is to contact local
law enforcement before any problem occurs, and get some idea of
their expertise and willingness to help you in the event of a problem.
The time you invest up front could pay big dividends later on if
you need to decide who to call at 2 a.m. on a holiday because you
have found evidence that someone is making unauthorized use of your
system.</P

><p class="para">There
are many potential problems in dealing with law-enforcement agencies,
not the least of which is their lack of experience with computer
criminal-related investigations. Sadly, there are still many Federal
agents who are not well versed with computers and computer crime.
In most local jurisdictions, there may be even less expertise. Your
case will be probably be investigated by an agent who has little
or no training in computing.</P
><p class="para">Computer-illiterate agents
will sometimes seek your assistance and try to understand the subtleties
of the case. Other times, they will ignore helpful advice&nbsp;- perhaps
to hide their own ignorance&nbsp;- often to the detriment of the

the court order directs such &quot;expert&quot; involvement.
Otherwise, you may find yourself complicating the case by appearing
as an overzealous victim. You will usually benefit by recommending

Your
equipment might be seized as evidence, or held for an unreasonable
length of time for examination. If you are the victim and are reporting
the case, the authorities will usually make every attempt to coordinate
their examinations with you, to cause you the least amount of inconvenience.
However, if the perpetrators are your employees, or if regulated
information is involved (bank, military, etc.), you might have no
control over the manner or duration of the examination of your systems
and media. This problem becomes more severe if you are dealing with
agents who need to seek expertise outside their local offices to
examine the material. Be sure to keep track of <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35263"></A
>
downtime during an investigation
as it may be included as part of the damage during prosecution and
any subsequent civil suit.</P
><p class="para">An investigation is another
situation in which <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35267"></A
>
backups
can be extremely valuable. You might even make use of your disaster-recovery
plan, and use a standby or spare site while your regular system
is being examined.</P
><p class="para">Heavy-handed or inept investigative
efforts may also place you in an uncomfortable position with respect
to the computer community. Attitudes directed toward law-enforcement
officers can easily be redirected toward you. Such attitudes can
place you in a worse light than you deserve, and may hinder not
only cooperation with the current investigation, but also with other
professional activities. Furthermore, they may make you a target
for electronic attack or other forms of abuse after the investigation
concludes. These attitudes are unfortunate, because there are some
very good investigators, and careful investigation and prosecution
may be needed to stop malicious or persistent intruders.</P
><p class="para">For
these reasons, we encourage you to carefully consider the decision
to involve law-enforcement agencies with any security problem pertaining
to your system. In most cases, we suggest that you may not want
to involve the criminal justice system at all unless a real loss
has occurred, or unless you are unable to control the situation
on your own. In some instances, the publicity involved in a case
may be more harmful than the loss you have sustained. However, be
aware that the problem you spot may be part of a much larger problem
that is ongoing or beginning to develop. You may be risking further
damage and delay if you decide to ignore the situation.</P
><p class="para">We
wish to stress the positive. Law-enforcement agencies are aware
of the need to improve how they investigate computer crime cases,
and they are working to develop in-service training, forensic analysis
facilities, and other tools to help them conduct effective investigations.
In many jurisdictions (especially in high-tech areas of the country),
investigators and prosecutors have gained considerable experience
and have worked to convey that information to their peers. The result
is a significant improvement in law enforcement effectiveness over
the last few years, with a number of successful investigations and
prosecutions. You should very definitely think about the positive
aspects of reporting a computer crime&nbsp;-  not only for yourself,
but for the community as a whole. Successful prosecutions may help
dissuade further misuse of your system and of others' systems.</P

>If law-enforcement officials believe
that your computer system has been used by an employee to break
into other computer systems, to transmit or store controlled information
(trade secrets, child pornography, etc.), or to otherwise participate
in some computer crime, you may find your computers impounded by
a search warrant (criminal cases) or writ of seizure (civil cases).
If you can document that your employee has had limited access to
your systems, and if you present that information during the search,
it may help limit the scope of the confiscation. However, you may
still be in a position in which some of your equipment is confiscated
as part of a legal search.</P

search warrant
if they believe there is evidence to be found concerning a violation
of a law. If the warrant is in order, the judge will almost always
grant the search warrant. Currently, a few Federal investigators
and law-enforcement personnel in some states have a poor reputation
for heavy-handed and excessively broad searches. The scope of the
search is usually detailed in the warrant by the agent in charge
and approved by the judge; most warrants are derived from &quot;boiler
plate&quot; examples that are themselves too broad. These problems
have resulted in considerable ill will, and in the future might
result in evidence not being admissible on Constitutional grounds
because a search was too wide-ranging. How to define the proper
scope of a search is still a matter of some evolution in the courts.</P
><p class="para">Usually, the police seek to confiscate anything connected
with the computer that may have evidence (e.g., files with stolen
source code or telephone access codes). This confiscation might
result in seizure of the computer, all magnetic media that could
be used with the computer, anything that could be used as an external
storage peripheral (e.g., videotape machines and tapes), auto-dialers
that could contain phone numbers for target systems in their battery-backed
memory, printers and other peripherals necessary to examine your
system (in case it is nonstandard in setup), and all documentation
and printouts. In past investigations, even laser printers, answering
machines, and televisions have been seized by Federal agents.</P
><p class="para">Officers are required to give a receipt for what they take.
However, you may wait a very long time before you get your equipment
back, especially if there is a lot of storage media involved, or
if the officers are not sure what they are looking for. Your equipment
may not even be returned in working condition&nbsp;- batteries
discharge, media degrades, and dust works its way into moving parts.</P
><p class="para">You should discuss the return of your equipment during
the execution of the warrant, or thereafter with the prosecutors.
You should indicate priorities (and reasons) for the items to be
returned. In most cases, you can request copies of critical data
and programs. As the owner of the equipment, you can also file suit[4] to have it returned,
but such suits may drag on and may not be productive. Suits to recover
damages may not be allowed against law-enforcement agencies that
are pursuing a legitimate investigation.</P

Rules of Criminal Procedure.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">You can also
challenge the reasons used to file the warrant and seek to have
it declared invalid, forcing the return of your equipment. However,
in some cases, warrants have been sealed to protect ongoing investigations
and informants, so this option can be made much more difficult to
execute. Equipment and media seized during a search may be held
until a trial if they contain material to be used as prosecution
evidence. Some state laws require forfeiture of the equipment on
conviction.</P
><p class="para">At present, a search is not likely to involve
confiscation of a mainframe or even a minicomputer. However, confiscation
of tapes, disks, and printed material could disable your business
even if the computer itself is not taken. Having full backups offsite
may not be sufficient protection, because tapes might also be taken
by a search warrant. If you think that a search might curtail your
legitimate business, be sure that the agents conducting the search
have detailed information regarding which records are vital to your
ongoing operation and request copies from them.</P
><p class="para">Until
the law is better defined in this area, you are well advised to
consult with your attorney if you are at all worried that a confiscation
might occur. Furthermore, if you have homeowners' or business
insurance, you might check with your agent to see if it covers damages
resulting from law-enforcement agents during an investigation. Business
interruption insurance provisions should also be checked if your
business depends on your computer. <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35295"></A

consequence is that the computing milieu becomes incrementally more
dangerous for all of us.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35367"></A
