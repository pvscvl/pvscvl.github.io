><p class="para">For years,
firewalls were strictly a do-it-yourself affair. A big innovation
was the introduction of several firewall toolkits&nbsp;- ready-made
proxies and client programs designed to build a simple, straightforward
firewall system. Lately, a number of companies have started offering
complete firewall &quot;solutions.&quot; </P

there are four basic types of firewalls in use:</P

></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">These firewalls rewrite the contents of the IP packets
as they pass between the internal network and the Internet. From
the outside, all communications appear to be mediated through a
proxy on the firewall. From the inside network, the firewall is
transparent.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Screens</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">These firewalls bisect a single Ethernet with a
pair of Ethernet interfaces. The screen doesn't have an
IP address. Instead, each Ethernet interface listens to all packets
that are transmitted on its segment and forwards the appropriate
packets, based on a complex set of rules, to the other interfaces.
Because the screen does not have an IP address, it is highly resistant
to attack over the network. For optimal security, the screen should
be programmed through a serial interface or removable media (e.g.,
floppy disk), although you can design a screen that would be addressed
through its Ethernet interface directly (speaking a network protocol
other than IP). Some manufacturers of screens provide several network
interfaces, so that you can set up a <span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
> server
or a news server on a separate screened subnet using the same screen.</P

built from a choke and a gate that uses proxies to move information
between the internal network and the external network. We describe
how to build this kind of firewall because the tools are readily
available, and because this type seems to provide adequate security
for many applications.</P

The choke is the bridge between the inside
network and the outside network. It should not forward packets between
the two networks unless the packets have the gate computer as either
their destination or their origination address. You can optionally
further restrict the choke so that it forwards only packets for
particular protocols&nbsp;- for example, packets used for mail
transfer but not for telnet or rlogin. </P

Use
an &quot;intelligent router.&quot; Many of these routers
can be set up to forward only certain kinds of packets and only
between certain addresses. </P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">You can use a standard <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> computer
with two network interfaces. If you do so, do not run the program
/usr/etc/routed (the network routing
daemon) on this computer. Set up the program so that it does not
forward packets from one network interface to the other (usually
by setting the kernel ip forwarding variable to 0).[7]
A computer set up in this fashion is both the choke and the gate.&#13;</P

Linux, IP forwarding is a compile-time option. </P

><li class="listitem"><p class="para">You can alter your operating system's network
driver so that it only accepts packets from the internal network
and the choke. If you are running Linux, you can use the operating
system's kernel-based IP filtering, accessible through
the <kbd class="command">ipfw</KBD

receiving packets from non-approved networks or hosts. In the not
too distant future, other vendors may offer similar features.</P
></LI
></OL
><p class="para">The details of how you set up your choke will vary greatly,
depending on the hardware you use and that hardware's software.
Therefore, the following sections are only general guidelines.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-21-SECT-2.4">21.2.4 Choosing the Choke's Protocols</A
></H3
><p class="para">The
choke is an intelligent filter: it is usually set up so that only
the gate machine can talk to the outside world. All messages from
the outside (whether they're mail, <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>,
or attempts to break in) that are directed to internal machines
other than the gate are rejected. Attempts by local machines to
contact sites outside the <span class="acronym">LAN</SPAN
> are similarly denied.&#13;</P
><p class="para">The gate determines destinations, then handles requests
or forwards them as appropriate. For instance, <span class="acronym">SMTP</SPAN
>
(mail) requests can be sent to the gate, which resolves local aliases
and then sends the mail to the appropriate internal machine. </P
><p class="para">Furthermore, you can set up your choke so that only specific
kinds of messages are sent through. You should configure the choke
to reject messages using unknown protocols. You can also configure
the choke to specifically reject known protocols that are too dangerous
for people in the outside world to use on your internal computers.&#13;</P
><p class="para">The choke software should carefully examine the option
bits that might be set in the header of each IP packet. Option bits,
such as those for IP forwarding, fragmentation, and route recording,
may be valid on some packets. However, they are sometimes set by
attackers in an attempt to probe the state of your firewall or to
get packets past a simple choke. Other options, such as source routing,
are never acceptable; packets that specify them should be blocked.</P
><p class="para">You also want to configure the choke to examine the return
addresses (source addresses) on packets. Packets from outside your
network should not state source addresses from inside your network,
nor should they be broadcast or multicast addresses. Otherwise,
an attacker might be able to craft packets that look normal to your
choke and clients; in such cases, the responses to these packets
are what actually do the damage.</P
><p class="para">The choke can also
be configured to prevent local users from connecting to outside
machines through unrestricted channels. This type of configuration
prevents Trojan-horse programs from installing network back doors
on your local machines. Imagine a public domain data-analysis program
that surreptitiously listens on port 49372 for connections and then
forks off a /bin/csh. The configuration also discourages
someone who does manage to penetrate one of your local machines
from sending information back to the outside world. </P
><p class="para">Ideally,
there should be no way to change your choke's configuration
from the network. An attacker trying to tap into your network will
be stuck if your choke is a PC-based router that can be reprogrammed
only from its keyboard.</P
><blockquote class="note"><p class="para"><strong>NOTE:</STRONG
> The way you configure your choke will depend on the
particular router that you are using for a choke; consult your router's
documentation for detail. </P
