>A backup strategy describes how often you back up
each of your computer's partitions, what kinds of backups
you use, and for how long backups are kept. Backup strategies are
based on many factors, including:</P

><p class="para">Most <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9278"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9280"></A
>
users do not back up their workstations
on a regular basis: they think that backing up their data is too
much effort. Unfortunately, they don't consider the effort
required to retype everything that they've ever done to
recover their records.</P
><p class="para">Here is a simple backup strategy for users with PCs or stand-alone
workstations:</P

></H4
><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term">Full backups </DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Once a month, or after a major software package
is installed, back up the entire system. At the beginning of each
year, make two complete backups and store them in different locations.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Project-related backups </DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Back up current projects and critical files with
specially written Perl or shell scripts. For example, you might
have a Perl script that backs up all of the files for a program
you are writing, or all of the chapters of your next book. These
files can be bundled and compressed into a single tar file, which
can often then be stored on a floppy disk or saved over the network
to another computer.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Home-directory backups</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">If your system is on a network, write a shell script
that backs up your home directory to a remote machine. Set the script
to automatically run once a day, or as often as is feasible. But
beware: if you are not careful, you could easily overwrite your
backup with a bad copy before you realize that something needs to
be restored. Spending a few extra minutes to set things up properly
(for example, by keeping three or four home-directory backups on
different machines, each updated on a different day of the week)
can save you a lot of time (and panic) later.</P
></DD
></DL
><p class="para">This strategy never uses incremental backups; instead, complete
backups of a particular set of files are always created. Such project-related
backups tend to be incredibly comforting and occasionally valuable.</P

backups forever.</P

wish
to perform incremental backups, you can improve their reliability
by using media rotation. In implementing this strategy, you actually
create two complete sets of backup tapes, A and B. At the beginning
of your backup cycle, you perform two complete dumps, first to tape
A, and then on the following day, to tape B. Each day you perform
an incremental dump, alternating tapes A and B. In this way, each
file is backed up in two locations. This scheme is shown graphically
in <a class="xref" href="#PUIS-CHP-7-FIG-2" title="Incremental backup with media rotation">Figure 7.2</A
