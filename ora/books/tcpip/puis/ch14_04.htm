><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17586"></A
>Modems raise a number of security concerns because
they create links between your computer and the outside world. Modems
can be used by individuals inside your organization to remove confidential
information. Modems can be used by people outside your organization
to gain unauthorized access to your computer. If your modems can
be reprogrammed or otherwise subverted, they can be used to trick
your users into revealing their passwords. And, finally, an attacker
can eavesdrop on a modem communication.</P
><p class="para">Today, modems
remain a popular tool for breaking into large corporate networks.
The reason is simple: while corporations closely monitor their network
connections, modems are largely unguarded. In many organizations,
there is no good way to prevent users from putting modems on their
desktop computers and running &quot;remote access&quot;
software.</P
><p class="para">So what can be done? To maximize security,
modems should be provided by the organization and administered in
a secure fashion.</P
><p class="para">The first step is to protect the modems
themselves. Be sure they are located in a physically secure location,
so that no unauthorized individual can access them. This protection
is to prevent the modems from being altered or rewired. Some modems
can have altered microcode or passwords loaded into them by someone
with appropriate access, and you want to prevent such occurrences.
You might make a note of the configuration switches (if any) on
the modem, and periodically check them to be certain they remain
unchanged.</P
><p class="para">Many modems sold these days allow remote
configuration and testing. This capability makes changes simpler
for personnel who manage several remote locations. It also makes
abusing your modems simpler for an attacker. Therefore, be certain
that such features, if present in your modems, are disabled.</P
><p class="para">The next most important aspect of protecting your modems is
to protect their telephone numbers. Treat the telephone numbers
for your modems the same as you treat your passwords: don't
publicize them to anyone other than those who have a need to know.
Making the telephone numbers for your modems widely known increases
the chances that somebody might try to use them to break into your
system. We'll describe some approaches in later sections.</P
><p class="para">Unfortunately, you cannot keep the telephone numbers of your
modems absolutely secret. After all, people do need to call them.
And even if you were extremely careful with the numbers, an attacker
could always discover the modem numbers by dialing every telephone
number in your exchange. For this reason, simple secrecy isn't
a solution; your modems need more stringent protection.[2]</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[2] You
might think about changing your modem phone numbers on a yearly
basis as a basic precaution.</P

></H4
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17636"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17638"></A
>A callback scheme is one in which an outsider
calls your machine, connects to the software, and provides some
form of identification. The system then severs the connection and
calls the outsider back at a predetermined phone number. This scheme
enhances security because the system will dial only preauthorized
numbers, so an attacker cannot get the system to initiate a connection
to his or her modem.</P
><p class="para">Unfortunately, callback can be
subverted if the same modem that the outsider called is used to
call the user back. Many phone systems, and especially some <span class="acronym">PBX</SPAN
>
systems, will not disconnect a call initiated from an outside line
until the outside line is hung up.</P
><p class="para">To subvert such
a callback system, the attacker merely calls the &quot;callback
modem&quot; and then does not hang up when the modem attempts
to sever the connection. The modem tries to hang up, then picks
the phone back up and tries to dial out. The attacker's
modem is then set to answer the callback modem, and the system is
subverted. This type of attack can also be performed on systems
that are not using a callback, but are doing normal dialout operations.
For example, the attack can be used to intercept messages that are
sent over a <span class="acronym">UUCP</SPAN
> connection; the attacker merely
configures a computer system to have the same name and <span class="acronym">UUCP</SPAN
>
login account as the system that is being called.</P
><p class="para">Some
callback systems attempt to get around this problem by waiting for
a dial tone. Unfortunately, these modems can be fooled by an attacker
who simply plays a recording of a dial tone over the open line.</P
><p class="para">The only way to foil an attacker who is attempting
this kind of trick is to have two sets of modems&nbsp;- one set
for dialing in, and one set for dialing out. To make this work,
you should have the telephone company install the lines so that
the incoming lines cannot be used to dial out, and the outgoing
lines have no telephone number for dialing in. This setup costs
more than a regular line, but adds an extra measure of security
for your phone connections.</P
><p class="para">Note that even with these
precautions, there are other ways to subvert a calback. For example,
someone could install call-forwarding on the called-back number
and reroute the call through the switches at the phone company.
Callback schemes can enhance your system's overall security,
but you should not depend on them as your only means of protection.</P

>In many areas, you can purchase
an additional telephone service called Caller-ID. As its name implies,
Caller-ID identifies the phone number of each incoming telephone
call. The phone number is usually displayed on a small box next
to the telephone when the phone starts ringing. (Note that this
feature may not be available to you if you own your own <span class="acronym">PBX</SPAN

the virtues of its privacy and security: by knowing the phone number
of an incoming call, you can make the decision as to whether or
not you wish to answer it.</P

with computers. Several modem makers now support Caller-ID directly.
With one of these modems, you can program the modem to send the
telephone number of the calling instrument to the computer. You
can then write custom software to limit incoming calls to a specified
list of phone numbers, or to only allow certain users to use certain
phones.</P

Services Digital Network (<span class="acronym">ISDN</SPAN

service also provides the phone number of the caller through a similar
service called Automatic Number Identification (<span class="acronym">ANI</SPAN

This service is available to many corporate 800-number subscribers.

are only as secure as the underlying telephone network infrastructure:
if an attacker managed to break into the telephone company's
computers, that attacker could reprogram them to display incorrect
numbers on the Caller-ID display, or to bypass Restricted Calling
Groups. Although there are no officially acknowledged cases of such
attacks, the possibility exists, and many credible but &quot;informal&quot;

telephone line can simply be bridged and fed into a separate surveillance
modem. Cellular telephone modems are even easier to tap, as their

A tap can be placed on your line by employees at the telephone company,

this manner (and, allegedly, have done so).</P

be used to obtain a legal wiretap or even a search warrant. (In
the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was an explosion in the use
of unnamed, paid informants by law enforcement agencies in the United
States.) Information could also be used for extralegal purposes,

and require that the system operator distribute a different key

most organizations. But there is also a growing number of public
key systems, which offer simple-to-use security that is still of
