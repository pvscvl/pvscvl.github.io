><p class="para">We haven't presented the material in this chapter
to induce paranoia in you, gentle reader. Instead, we want to get
across the point that you need to consider carefully who and what
you trust. If you have information or equipment that is of value
to you, you need to think about the risks and dangers that might
be out there. To have security means to trust, but that trust must
be well placed.</P
><p class="para">If you are protecting information that is worth a great deal,
attackers may well be willing to invest significant time and resources
to break your security. You may also think you don't have
information that is worth a great deal; nevertheless, you are a
target anyway. Why? Your site may be a convenient stepping stone
to another, more valuable site. Or perhaps one of your users is
storing information of great value that you don't know
about. Or maybe you simply don't realize how much the information
you have is actually worth. For instance, in the late 1980's,
Soviet agents were willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars
for copies of the <span class="acronym">VMS</SPAN
> operating system source&nbsp;- the
same source that many site administrators kept in unlocked cabinets
in public computer rooms.</P
><p class="para">To trust, you need to be suspicious. Ask questions. Do background
checks. Test code. Get written assurances. Don't allow
disclaimers. Harbor a healthy suspicion of fortuitous coincidences
(the <span class="acronym">FBI</SPAN
> happening to call or that patch tape
showing up by FedEx, hours after you discover someone trying to
exploit a bug that the patch purports to fix). You don't
need to go overboard, butremember that the best way to develop trust
is to anticipate problems and attacks, and then test for them. Then
test again, later. Don't let a routine convince you that
no problems will occur.</P
><p class="para">If you absorb everything we've written in this book,
and apply it, you'll be way ahead of the game. However,
this information is only the first part of a comprehensive security
plan. You need to constantly be accumulating new information, studying
your risks, and planning for the future. Complacency is one of the
biggest dangers you can face. As we said at the beginning of the
book, <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> can be a secure system, but only if
you understand it and deploy it in a monitored environment.</P
><p class="para">You can trust us on that.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35997"></A
