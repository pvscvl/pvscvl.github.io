>Encryption
is subject to the law in the United States for two reasons: public
key cryptography is subject to several patents in the United States;
and U.S. law currently classifies cryptography as munitions, and
as such, regulates it with export control restrictions.</P
><p class="para">While these restrictions have hampered the widespread use
of cryptography within the United States, they have done little
to limit the use of cryptography abroad, one of the putative goals
of the export control restrictions.</P

software patents</EM
>,
are the subject of ongoing controversy in the computer industry
and in parts of Congress. As the number of software patents issued
has steadily grown each year, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
has come under increasing attack for granting too many patents which
are apparently neither new nor novel. There is also some underlying
uncertainty whether patents on software are Constitutional, but
no case has yet been tried in an appropriate court to definitively
settle the matter.</P
><p class="para">Some of the earliest and most important software patents granted
in the United States were in the field of public key cryptography.
In particular, Stanford University was awarded two fundamental patents
on the knapsack and Diffie-Hellman encryption systems, and <span class="acronym">MIT</SPAN
>
was awarded a patent on the <span class="acronym">RSA</SPAN
> algorithm. <a class="xref" href="#PUIS-CHP-6-TAB-4" title="The Public Key Cryptography Patents">Table 6.4</A
>
summarizes the various patents that have been awarded on public
key cryptography.</P
><p class="para">Between 1989 and 1995, all of these patents were exclusively
licensed to Public Key Partners, a small company based in Redwood
City, California. As this book went to press, the partnership was
dissolved, and the patents have apparently reverted to the partners,
Cylink, Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif., and <span class="acronym">RSA</SPAN
> Data
Security of Redwood City, Calif. Exactly what this change in status
means for people wishing to practice the inventions has not yet
been determined.</P

>Under current U.S. law,
cryptography is a munition, akin to nuclear materials and biological
warfare agents. Thus, export of cryptographic machines (such as
computer programs that implement cryptography) is covered by the
Defense Trade Regulations (formerly known as the International Traffic
in Arms Regulation&nbsp;- <span class="acronym">ITAR</SPAN
>). To export
a program in machine-readable format that implements cryptography,
you need a license from the Office of Defense Trade Controls (<span class="acronym">DTC</SPAN
>)
inside the U.S. State Department; publishing the same algorithm
in a book or public paper is not controlled.</P
><p class="para">To get a license to export a program, you disclose the program
to <span class="acronym">DTC</SPAN
>, which then makes an evaluation. (In practice,
these decisions are actually made by the National Security Agency.)
Historically, programs that implement sufficiently weak cryptography
are allowed to be exported; those with strong cryptography, such
as <span class="acronym">DES</SPAN
>, are denied export licenses.</P
><p class="para">A 1993 survey by the Software Publisher's Association,
a U.S.-based industry advocacy group, found that encryption is widely
available in overseas computer products and that availability is
growing. They noted the existence of more than 250 products distributed
overseas containing cryptography. Many of these products use technologies
that are patented in the U.S. (At the time, you could literally
buy high-quality programs that implement <span class="acronym">RSA</SPAN
>
encryption on the streets of Moscow, although Russia has since enacted
stringent restrictions on the sale of cryptographic programs.)</P

><p class="para">Most European countries used to have regulations regarding
software similar to those in force in the U.S. Many were discarded
in the early 1990s in favor of a more liberal policy, which allows
mass-market software to be freely traded.</P
><p class="para">In 1992, the Software Publishers Association and the State
Department reached an agreement which allows the export of programs
containing <span class="acronym">RSA</SPAN
> Data Security's RC2 and
RC4 algorithms, but only when the key size is set to 40 bits or
less. 40 bits is not very secure, and application of a distributed
attack using standard workstations in a good-size lab can break
these in at most a few days. This theory was demonstrated quite
visibly in mid-1995 when two independent groups broke 40-bit keys
used in the export version of the Netscape browser. Although the
effort took many machines and days of effort, both were accomplished
in fairly standard research environments similar to many others
around the world.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8789"></A
>Canada is
an interesting case in the field of export control. Under current
U.S. policy, any cryptographic software can be directly exported
to Canada without the need of an export license. Canada has also
liberalized its export policy, allowing any Canadian-made cryptographic
software to be further exported abroad. But software that is exported
to Canada cannot then be exported to a third country, thanks to
Canada's Rule #5100, which honors U.S. export
prohibitions on &quot;all goods originating in the United States&quot;
unless they have been &quot;further processed or manufactured
outside the United States so as to result in a substantial change
in value, form, or use of the goods or in the production of new
goods.&quot;</P
><p class="para">Several companies are now avoiding the hassle of export controls
by doing their software engineering overseas, and then importing
the products back <em class="emphasis">into</EM
> the United States. We
feel that current regulations only serve to hobble U.S. industry,
and only play a minor role in slowing the spread of encryption use
worldwide.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8793"></A
