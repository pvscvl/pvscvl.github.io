><p class="para">We feel ambivalent about
firewalls. While they are an interesting technology, they are not
a cure-all for network security problems. They also are being used
to connect many networks to the Internet that should not necessarily
be connected. So before you run out and invest your time and money
in a firewall solution, consider these points:</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-21-SECT-6.1">21.6.1 Firewalls Can Be Dangerous</A
></H3
><p class="para">We started
the chapter by pointing out that a firewall is not a panacea. We
will conclude the chapter by making the point again: firewalls can
be a big help in ensuring the security of your network; however,
a misconfigured firewall, or a firewall with poor per-host controls,
may actually be <em class="emphasis">worse</EM
> than no firewall at all.
With no firewall in place, you will at least be more concerned about
host security and monitoring. Unfortunately, at many sites, management
may be lulled into believing that their systems are secure after
they have paid for the installation of a significant firewall&nbsp;- especially
if they are only exposed to the advertising hype of the vendor and
consultants.</P
></DIV
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-21-SECT-6.2">21.6.2 Firewalls Sometimes Fail</A
></H3
><p class="para">The truth of
the matter is that a firewall is only one component of good security.
And it is a component that is only effective against external threats.
Insider attacks are seldom affected in any way by a firewall. Collusion
of an insider and an outsider can circumvent a firewall in short
order. And bugs, misconfiguration problems, or equipment failure
may all result in a temporary failure of the firewall you have in
place. One single user, anywhere &quot;inside&quot; your
network, can also unwittingly compromise the entire firewall scheme
by connecting a modem to a desktop workstation ... and you
will not likely know about the compromise until you are required
to clean up the resulting break in.</P
><p class="para">Does this case sound
unlikely? It isn't. Richard Power of the Computer Security
Institute (<span class="acronym">CSI</SPAN
>) surveyed more than 320 Fortune
500 computer sites about their experiences with firewalls. His survey
results were released in September of 1995 and revealed that 20%
of all sites had experienced a computer security incident. Interestingly,
30% of the Internet security incidents reported by respondents
occurred <em class="emphasis">after</EM
> the installation of a firewall.
This incident rate is probably a combined result of misconfiguration,
unmonitored back door connections, and other difficulties. </P
><p class="para">The <span class="acronym">CSI</SPAN
> study raised a number of questions:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Perhaps the firewall installation
at some sites was faulty, or too permissive.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Perhaps users internal to the organization found
ways to circumvent the firewall by connecting unauthorized modems
to the network, thus creating back doors into the network.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Perhaps the use of firewalls resulted in feelings
of overconfidence and a resulting relaxation of other, more traditional
controls, thus leading to problems.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Perhaps the sites using the firewalls are more attractive
targets than sites without firewalls, and thus attract more attacks.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Perhaps, as suggested by many other studies, the
majority of incidents continue to be caused by insiders, and these
are not stopped by firewalls.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Perhaps the sites didn't really have a
firewall. Over 50% of the companies that claimed to have
a &quot;firewall&quot; merely had a screening router.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">The key conclusion to be drawn from all of this information
is that one or more network firewalls may help your security, but
you should plan the rest of your security so that your systems will
still be protected in the event that your firewall fails.</P

Internet?</A
></H3
><p class="para">Let us conclude by reiterating something
we said earlier&nbsp;- if you have no network connection, you
don't need an external firewall. The question you really
should ask before designing a firewall strategy is: what is to be
gained from having the connection to the outside, and who is driving
the connection? This question revisits the basic issues of policy
and risk assessment discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch02_01.htm" title="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2, <cite class="chapter">Policies and Guidelines</CITE
></A
>.</P
><p class="para">At many
locations, users are clamoring for Internet access because they
want access to Usenet news, entertaining mailing lists, personal
email, and <span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
> on their desktop. However, employees
often do not want access to these services for purposes that are
work related or work enhancing. Indeed, many organizations are now
restricting in-house access to those services because employees
are wasting too much time on them. Rather than having full network
access to your entire corporate network, you might consider using
one approach for users who need Internet access, and a different
approach for users who simply want Internet access. For example:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Have a disconnected network of a small
number of machines that are connected to the Internet. Users who
really need Internet access are given accounts on these machines
for as long as they continue to need access. A tape drive or serial-line
<span class="acronym">UUCP</SPAN
> connection is made available to transfer
files between these machines and the internal network without exposing
all the internal nodes to IP-based attacks.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Use a hard-wired <span class="acronym">UUCP</SPAN
> connection
to transfer email between your internal network and the Internet.
This connection will allow your employees to exchange email with
other sites for work-related purposes, but will not expose your
network to IP-based attacks.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Provide remaining users with some form of account
access through an <span class="acronym">ISP</SPAN
> outside your company. Then,
on their own time, your employees can access the Internet (and possibly
some other special services). If you negotiate with the <span class="acronym">ISP</SPAN
>
for a large block of accounts for your employees, you may be able
to get a very good rate. The rate may be so good, in fact, that
you may wish to use company funds to subsidize the accounts, and
have low-cost personal Internet access (at home) be another benefit
for working at your company. This solution is probably cheaper than
a firewall, a major break-in, and the time lost to employees surfing
the <span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
> at work.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">Remember that the best firewall is still a large air gap between
the network and any of your computers, and that a pair of wire cutters
remains the most effective network protection mechanism.[14]</P
