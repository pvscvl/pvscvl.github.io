could run the <kbd class="command">chown</KBD

they owned to that of any other user on the system. This let them
&quot;give away&quot; a file. The feature made sharing files
back and forth possible, and allowed a user to turn over project
directories to someone else.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-6250"></A
>Allowing
users to give away files can be a security problem because it makes
a miscreant's job of hiding his tracks much easier. If
someone has acquired stolen information or is running programs that
are trying to break computer security, that person can simply change
the ownership of the files to that of another user. If he sets the
permissions correctly, he can still read the results. Permitting
file give-aways also makes file quotas useless: a user who runs
out of quota simply changes the ownership of his larger files to
another user. Worse, perhaps, he can create a huge file and change
its ownership to someone else, exceeding the user's quota
instantly. If the file is in a directory to which the victim does
not have access, he or she is stuck.</P
><p class="para">The <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> development group saw these problems
and changed the behavior of <kbd class="command">chown</KBD
> so that only the superuser could
change ownership of files. This change has led to an interesting
situation. When the <span class="acronym">POSIX</SPAN
> group working on a
standard was faced with the hard choice of which behavior to pick
as standard, they bravely took a stand and said &quot;both.&quot;
Thus, depending on the setting of a system configuration parameter,
your system can use either the old <span class="acronym">AT&T</SPAN
> behavior,
or the <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>-derived behavior. We <em class="emphasis">strongly</EM
>
urge you to choose the <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>-derived behavior.
Not only does it allow you to use file quotas and keep mischievous
users from framing other users, but many software packages you might
download from the net or buy from vendors will not work properly
if run under the old <span class="acronym">AT&T</SPAN
>-style environment.</P
><blockquote class="note"><p class="para"><strong>NOTE:</STRONG
> If your system came to you with the old <kbd class="command">chown</KBD
> behavior, then ensure that the software was written with
that in mind. Be extra careful as you read some of our advice in
this book, because a few things we might recommend won't
work for you on such a system. Also, be especially cautious about
software you might download from the net or buy from a vendor. Most
of this software has been developed under <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>-derived
systems that limit use of <kbd class="command">chown</KBD

might have vulnerabilities when run under your environment.  </P
><p class="para">Do
<em class="emphasis">not </EM

using some form of network filesystem or removable, user-mountable
media. The result can be a compromise of your system. Files created

If your version of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

You should determine how your system behaves under these circumstances
and be alert to combinations of actions that might accidentally
create a <span class="acronym">SUID</SPAN

  <span class="acronym">POSIX</SPAN
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-6293"></A
>
specifies that when <kbd class="command">chown</KBD
> is
executed on a symbolic link, the ownership of the target of the
link is changed instead of the ownership of the link itself. <span class="acronym">POSIX</SPAN
>
further specifies that the <kbd class="command">-R</KBD
> option does not follow symbolic links
if they point to directories (but nevertheless changes the ownership
of these directories). On most modern systems of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>,
there is a <kbd class="command">-h</KBD
> option to <kbd class="command">chown</KBD
> (and <kbd class="command">chgrp</KBD
> and <kbd class="command">chmod</KBD
>) that
instructs the command to not follow the link and to instead change
the permissions on the link itself&nbsp;- or to ignore the symbolic
link and change nothing. You should understand how this behaves
on your system and use it if appropriate.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-6304"></A
