>Besides
criminal law, the courts also offer remedies through civil actions
(lawsuits). The nature of lawsuits is such that you can basically
sue anyone for any reasonable claim of damages or injury. You can
even sue parties unknown, as long as some hope exists of identifying
them at a later time. You can ask for actual and punitive payment
of damages, injunctive relief (cease-and-desist orders), as well
as other remedies for damage. Often, a case is easier to prove in
a civil court than in a criminal court. Civil cases require a less
strict standard of proof to convict than do criminal cases (a &quot;preponderance
of the evidence&quot; as opposed to the &quot;beyond a reasonable
doubt&quot; standard used in criminal cases).</P
><p class="para">Civil
remedies are much easier to get after a criminal conviction is obtained.</P
><p class="para">However, filing civil suits for damages in the case
of break-ins or unauthorized activity may not be a practical course
of action for several reasons:</P
><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Civil suits can be very expensive to
pursue. Criminal cases are prosecuted by a government unit, and
evidence collection and trial preparation are paid for by the government.
In a civil case, the gathering of evidence and the preparation of
trial material is done by your lawyers&nbsp;- and you pay for
it. Good lawyers still charge more than most computer consultants;
therefore, the cost of preparing even a minor suit may be quite
high. If you win your case, you may be able to have your lawyers'
fees included in your award, but don't count on such provisions.
Note, however, that criminal cases may sometimes be used as the
basis for later civil action.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The preparation and scheduling of a lawsuit may
take many years. In the meantime, unless you are able to get temporary
injunctions, whatever behavior that you are seeking to punish may
continue. The delay can also continue to increase the cost of your
preparation.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">You may not win a civil case. Even if you do win,
it's possible that your opponent will not have any resources
with which to pay damages or your lawyer fees, and so you therefore
may be out a considerable sum of money without any satisfaction
other than the moral victory of a court decision in your favor.
What's more, your opponent can always appeal&nbsp;- or
countersue.</P
></LI
></OL
><p class="para">The vast majority
of civil cases are settled out of court. Simply beginning the process
of bringing suit may be sufficient to force your opponent into a
settlement. If all you are seeking is to stop someone from breaking
into your system, or force someone to repay you for stolen computer
time or documents, a lawsuit may be an appropriate course of action.
In many cases, especially those involving juveniles trying to break
into your system, having a lawyer send an official letter of complaint
demanding an immediate stop to the activity may be a cheap and effective
way of achieving your goal.</P
><p class="para">As with other legal matters,
you should consult with a trained attorney to discuss trade-offs
and alternatives. There is a wide range of possibilities available
to you depending on your locale, the nature of your complaint, and
the nature of your opponent (business, individual, etc.).</P
><p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Never
threaten a lawsuit without prior legal advice.</EM
> Such threats
may lead to problems you don't need&nbsp;- or want. <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35397"></A
