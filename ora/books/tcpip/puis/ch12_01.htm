>&quot;Physical security&quot; is almost
everything that happens before you (or an attacker) start typing
commands on the keyboard. It's the alarm system that calls
the police department when a late-night thief tries to break into
your building. It's the key lock on the computer's
power supply that makes it harder for unauthorized people to turn
the machine off. And it's the surge protector that keeps
a computer from being damaged by power surges.</P
><p class="para">This
chapter discusses basic physical security approaches. It's
designed for people who think that this form of security is of no
concern. Unfortunately, physical security is an oft-overlooked aspect
of security that is <em class="emphasis">very</EM
> important. You may
have the best encryption and security tools in place, and your <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
systems may be safely hidden behind a firewall. However, if you
cheerfully hire an industrial spy as your system administrator,
and she walks off with your disk drives, those other fancy defenses
aren't much help.</P
><div class="sect1"><h2 class="sect1"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-12-SECT-1">12.1 One Forgotten Threat</A
></H2
><p class="para">Surprisingly, many
organizations do not consider physical security to be of the utmost
concern. One New York investment house was spending tens of thousands
of dollars on computer security measures to prevent break-ins during
the day, only to discover that its cleaning staff was propping open
the doors to the computer room at night while the floor was being
mopped. In the late 1980s, a magazine in San Francisco had more
than $100,000 worth of computers stolen over a holiday:
an employee had used his electronic key card to unlock the building
and disarm the alarm system; after getting inside, the person went
to the supply closet where the alarm system was located and removed
paper from the alarm system's log printer.</P
><p class="para">Physical
security is one of the most frequently forgotten forms of security
because the issues that physical security encompasses&nbsp;- the
threats, practices, and protections available&nbsp;- are different
for practically every different site. Physical security resists
simple treatment in books on computer security, as different organizations
running the identical system software might have dramatically different
physical-security needs. (Many popular books on <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
system security do not even mention physical security.) Because
physical security must inherently be installed on-site, it cannot
be pre-installed by the operating system vendor, sold by telemarketers,
or <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>'ed over the Internet as part
of a free set of security tools.</P
><p class="para">Anything that we can
write about physical security must therefore be broadly stated and
general. Because every site is different, this chapter can't
give you a set of specific recommendations. It can only give you
a starting point, a list of issues to consider, and a procedure
for formulating your plan.</P

></H3
><p class="para">The first
step to physically securing your installation is to formulate a
written plan addressing your current physical security needs and
your intended future direction&nbsp;- something we discussed in
<a class="xref" href="ch02_01.htm" title="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2, <cite class="chapter">Policies and Guidelines</CITE
></A
>. Ideally, such a plan should be part
of the site security policy, and should include:</P

installation, you should take great
care in formulating this plan. Have it reviewed by an outside firm
that specializes in disaster recovery planning and risk assessment.
You should also consider your security plan a sensitive document:
by its very nature, it contains detailed information on your defenses'
weakest points.</P
><p class="para">Smaller businesses, many educational
institutions, and home systems will usually not need anything so
formal; some preparation and common sense is all that is usually
necessary, although even a day of a consultant's time may
be money well spent.</P
><p class="para">Some organizations may consider
that many of the ideas described in the following sections are overkill.
Before you come to this conclusion, ask yourself five questions:</P
