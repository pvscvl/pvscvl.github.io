>Much of this book
has been devoted to techniques that protect computer systems from
attacks by outsiders. This focus isn't only our preoccupation:
overwhelmingly, companies fear attacks from outsiders more than
they fear attacks from the inside. Unfortunately, such fears are
misplaced. Statistics compiled by the <span class="acronym">FBI</SPAN
> and
others show that the majority of major economic losses from computer
crime appear to involve people on the &quot;inside.&quot;</P
><p class="para">Companies seem to fear attacks from outsiders more than insiders
because they fear the unknown. Few managers want to believe that
their employees would betray their bosses, or the company as a whole.
Few businesses want to believe that their executives would sell
themselves out to the competition. As a result, many organizations
spend vast sums protecting themselves from external threats, but
do little in the way of instituting controls and auditing to catch
and prevent problems from the inside.</P
><p class="para">Not protecting your organization against its own employees
is a short-sighted policy. Protecting against insiders automatically
buys an organization protection from outsiders as well. After all,
what do outside attackers want most of all? They want an account
on your computer, an account from which they can unobtrusively investigate
your system and probe for vulnerabilities. Employes, executives,
and other insiders already have this kind of access to your computers.
And, according to recent computer industry surveys, attacks from
outsiders and from rogue software account for only a small percentage
of overall corporate losses; as many as 80% of attacks
come from employees and former employees who are dishonest or disgruntled.</P
><p class="para">No person in your organization should be placed in a position
of absolute trust. Unfortunately, many organizations implicitly
trust the person who runs the firm's computer systems.
Increasingly, outside auditors are now taking a careful look at
the policies and procedures in Information Systems support organizations&nbsp;- 
making certain that backups are being performed, that employees
are accountable for their actions, and that everybody operates within
a framework of checks and balances.</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35940"></A
>The threat
of a dishonest system administrator should be obvious enough. After
all, who knows better where all the goodies are kept, and where
all the alarms are set? However, before you say that you trust your
support staff, ask yourself a question: they may be honest, but
are they competent?</P
><p class="para">We know of a recent case in which a departmental server was
thoroughly compromised by at least two different groups of hackers.
The system administrator had no idea what had happened, probably
because he wasn't very adept at <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
system administration. How were the intruders eventually discovered?
During a software audit, the system was revealed to be running software
that was inconsistent with what should have been there. What should
have been there was an old, unpatched version of the software.[5] Investigation revealed
that hackers had apparently installed new versions of system commands
to keep their environment up to date because the legitimate administrator
wasn't doing the job.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[5] Actually, the very latest software <em class="emphasis">should</EM
>
have been there. However, the system administrator hadn't
done any updates in more than two years, so we expected the old
software to be in place.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Essentially, the hackers were doing a better job of maintaining
the machine than the hired staff was. The hackers were then using
the machine to stage attacks against other computers on the Internet.</P
><p class="para">In such cases, you probably have more to fear from incompetent
staff than from some outsiders. After all, if the staff bungles
the backups, reformats the disk drives, and then accidentally erases
over the only good copies of data you have left, the data is as
effectively destroyed as if a professional saboteur had hacked into
the system and deleted it.</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35953"></A
>We heard about one case in which
a field service technician for a major computer company was busy
casing sites for later burglaries. He was shown into the building,
was given unsupervised access to the equipment rooms, and was able
to obtain alarm codes and door-lock combinations over time. When
the thefts occurred, police were sure the crime was an inside job,
but no one immediately realized how &quot;inside&quot; the
technician had become.</P
><p class="para">There are cases in which U.S. military and diplomatic personnel
at overseas postings had computer problems and took their machines
in to local service centers. When they got home, technicians discovered
a wide variety of interesting&nbsp;- and unauthorized&nbsp;- additions
to the circuitry.</P
><p class="para">What about the software you get from the vendor? For instance,
AT&amp;T claims that Ken Thompson's compiler modifications
(described earlier under &quot;Trusting Trust&quot;) were
never in any code that was shipped to customers. How do we know
for sure? What's really in the code on <em class="emphasis">your</EM

machines?</P

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-27-SECT-3.4">27.3.4 Your Consultants?</A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35961"></A
>There are currently several
people in the field of computer security consulting whose past is
not quite sterling. These are people who have led major hacking
rings, who brag about breaking into corporate and government computers,
and who may have been indicted and prosecuted for computer crimes.
Some of them have even done time in jail. Now they do security consulting&nbsp;- and
a few even use their past in advertising (although most do not).</P
><p class="para">How trustworthy are these people? Who better to break into
your computer system later on than the person who helped design
the defenses? Think about this issue from a liability standpoint&nbsp;- would
you hire a confessed arsonist to install your fire alarm system,
or a convicted pedophile to run your company day-care center? He'd
certainly know what to protect the children against! What would
your insurance company have to say about that? Your stockholders?</P
><p class="para">Some security consultants are more than simply criminals;
they are compulsive system hackers. Why should you believe that
they are more trustworthy and have more self control now than they
did a few years ago?</P
><p class="para">If you are careful not to hire suspicious individuals, how
about your service provider? Your maintenance organization? Your
software vendor? The company hired to clean your offices at night?
The temp service that provides you with replacements for your secretary
when your secretary goes on leave? Potential computer criminals,
and those with an unsavory past, are as capable of putting on street
clothes and holding down a regular job as anyone else. They don't
have a scarlet &quot;H&quot; tattooed on their foreheads.</P
><p class="para">Can you trust references for your hires or consultants? Consider
the story, possibly apocryphal, of the consultant at the large bank
who found a way to crack security and steal $5 million.
He was caught by bank security personnel later, but they couldn't
trace the money or discover how he did it. So he struck a deal with
the bank: he'd return all but 10% of the money,
forever remain silent about the theft, and reveal the flaw he exploited
in return for no prosecution and a favorable letter of reference.
The bank eagerly agreed, and wrote the loss off as an advertising
and training expense. Of course, with the favorable letter, he quickly
got a job at the next bank running the same software. After only
a few such job changes, he was able to retire with a hefty savings
account in Switzerland.</P
><div class="sidebar"><h4 class="sidebar"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-35967">Bankers Mistrust</A
></H4
><p class="para">Banks and financial institutions have notorious reputations
for not reporting computer crimes. We have heard of cases in which
bank personnel have traced active hacking attempts to a specific
person, or developed evidence showing that someone had penetrated
their systems, but they did not report these cases to the police
for fear of the resulting publicity.</P
><p class="para">In other cases, we've heard that bank personnel have
paid people off to get them to stop their attacks and keep quiet.
Some experts in the industry contend that major banks and trading
houses are willing to tolerate a few million dollars in losses per
week rather than suffer the perceived bad publicity about a computer
theft. To them, a few million a week is less than the interest they
make on investments over a few hours: it's below the noise
threshold.</P
><p class="para">Are these stories true? We don't know, but we haven't
seen too many cases of banks reporting computer crimes, and we somehow
don't think they are immune to attack. If anything, they're
bigger targets. However, we do know that bankers tend to be conservative,
and they worry that publicity about computer problems is bad for
business.</P
><p class="para">Odd, if true. Think about the fact that when some kid with
a gun steals $1000 from the tellers at a branch office,
the crime makes the evening news, pictures are in the newspaper,
and a regional alert is issued. No one loses confidence in the bank.
But if some hacker steals $5 million as the result of a
bug in the software and a lack of ethics...</P

>Your system has been hacked. You have a little
information, but not much. If someone acts quickly, before logs
at remote machines are erased, you might be able to identify the
culprit. You get a phone call from someone claiming to be with the
<span class="acronym">CERT</SPAN
>-CC, or maybe the <span class="acronym">FBI</SPAN
>.
They tell you they learned from the administrator at another site
that your systems might have been hacked. They tell you what to
look for, then ask what you found on your own. They promise to follow
right up on the leads you have and ask you to remain silent so as
not to let on to the hackers that someone is hot on their trail.
You never hear back from them, and later inquiries reveal that no
one from the agency involved ever called you.</P
><p class="para">Does this case sound farfetched? It shouldn't. Administrators
at commercial sites, government sites, and even response teams have
all received telephone calls from people who claim to be representatives
of various agencies but who aren't. We've also
heard that some of these same people have had their email intercepted,
copied, and read on its way to their machines (usually, a hacked
service provider or altered <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> record is all
that is needed). The result? The social engineers working the phones
have some additional background information that makes them sound
all the more official.</P
