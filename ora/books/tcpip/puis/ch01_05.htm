><p class="para">If we can't change <span class="acronym">UNIX </SPAN
>and the
environment in which it runs, the next best thing is to learn about
how to protect the system as best we can. That's the goal
of this book. If we can provide information to users and administrators
in a way that helps them understand the way things work and how
to use the safeguards, then we should be moving in the right direction.
After all, these areas seem to be where many of the problems originate.</P
><p class="para">Unfortunately, knowing how things work on the system is not
enough. Because of the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> design, a single
flaw in a <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> system program can compromise
the security of the operating system as a whole. This is why vigilance
and attention are needed to keep a system running securely: after
a hole is discovered, it must be fixed. Furthermore, in this age
of networked computing, that fix must be made widely available,
lest some users who have not updated their software fall victim
to more up-to-date attackers.</P
><blockquote class="note"><p class="para"><strong>NOTE:</STRONG
> Although this book includes numerous examples of past
security holes in the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> operating system,
we have intentionally not provided the reader with an exhaustive
list of the means by which a machine can be penetrated. Not only
would such information not necessarily help to improve the security
of your system, but it might place a number of systems running older
versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> at additional risk.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Even properly configured <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> systems are
still very susceptible to <i class="firstterm"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1190"></A
>denial of service</I
> attacks, where
one user can make the system unusable for everyone else by &quot;hogging&quot;
a resource or degrading system performance. In most circumstances,
however, administrators can track down the person who is causing
the interruption of service and deal with that person directly.
We'll talk about denial of service attacks in <a class="xref" href="ch25_01.htm" title="Denial of Service Attacks and Solutions">Chapter 25, <cite class="chapter">Denial of Service Attacks and Solutions</CITE
></A
>.</P
><p class="para">First of all, we start by discussing basic issues of policy
and risk in <a class="xref" href="ch02_01.htm" title="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2</A
>. Before you start setting
permissions and changing passwords, make sure you understand what
you are protecting and why. You should also understand what you
are protecting against. Although we can't tell you all
of that, we can outline some of the questions you need to answer
before you design your overall security plan.</P
><p class="para">Throughout the rest of the book, we'll be explaining
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> structures and mechanisms that can affect
your overall security. We concentrate on the fundamentals of the
way the system behaves so you can understand the basic principles
and apply them in your own environment. We have specifically <em class="emphasis">not</EM
>
presented examples and suggestions of where changes in the source
code can fix problems or add security. Although we know of many
such fixes, most <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> sites do not have access
to source code. Most system administrators do not have the necessary
expertise to make the required changes. Furthermore, source code
changes, as do configurations. A fix that is appropriate in March
1996 may not be desirable on a version of the operating system shipped
the following September. Instead, we present principles, with the
hope that they will give you better long-term results than one-time
custom modifications.</P
><p class="para">We suggest that you keep in mind that even if you take everything
to heart that we explain in the following chapters, and even if
you keep a vigilant watch over your systems, you may still not fully
protect your assets. You need to educate every one of your users
about good security and convince them to practice what they learn.
Computer security is a lonely, frustrating occupation if it is practiced
as a case of &quot;us&quot; (information security personnel)
versus &quot;them&quot; (the rest of the users). If you
can practice security as &quot;all of us&quot; (everyone
in the organization) versus &quot;them&quot; (people who
would breach our security), the process will be much easier. You
also need to help convince vendors to produce safer code. If we
all put our money behind our stated concerns, maybe the vendors
will finally catch on.</P
