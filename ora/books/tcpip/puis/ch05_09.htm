><p class="para">In closing, we'll mention two rather unusual ideas
in filesystems. This information is provided partially for completeness,
in the event that one of our readers has such a system. The second
reason is to document some ideas we don't think helped
security very much. We hope we don't encounter anything
like them again any time soon.</P

this
book, you will find that we often mention how the behavior of a
command or action may be different if your version of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
is derived from <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> or <span class="acronym">AT&T</SPAN
>
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>. These differences are not so great as they
once were, as <span class="acronym">SVR4</SPAN
> is the result of a merger
of the majority of these two lines into one system.</P
><p class="para">However, in years gone by, the two systems were separate.
This presented an interesting puzzle for some vendors who wanted
to cater to both markets. Thus, someone came up with the idea of
<i class="firstterm">universes</I
>. The idea itself was fairly simple.
Create a per-process &quot;switch&quot; in memory that would
be set to either <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
> or <span class="acronym">AT&T</SPAN
>.
The behavior of various system calls might depend on the value of
the switch. Furthermore, certain special directories could be set
up so that the directory you'd actually see would depend
on the switch setting. Thus, you could have <i class="filename">/usr/bin</I
>
full of user programs, but it would really be <em class="emphasis">two</EM
>
<i class="filename">/usr/bin</I
> directories &nbsp;-  one of <span class="acronym">BSD</SPAN
>
and one of<span class="acronym"> AT&T</SPAN
>!</P
><p class="para">Several companies adopted variations of the universe concept,
including Pyramid, Apollo, Masccomp, and Sequent. In some of these
systems, the switch from one environment to another was almost seamless,
from the user's point of view. However, the scheme had
several problems:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">It took more disk space for standard
configuration. The standard system needed two copies of libraries,
man pages, commands, and more.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">In most environments all the users stayed in a single
universe. Shops were seldom heterogeneous in environment, so users
preferred to stay with a familiar interface on everything they did.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Patching and maintaining the programs took more
than twice the effort because they required that users consider
interactions between software in each universe.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-6391"></A
>System administration
was often a nightmare. You didn't necessarily know where
all your commands were; you might need to worry about configuring
two different <span class="acronym">UUCP</SPAN
> systems; you couldn't
always tell which version of a program was spawning
jobs; and so on.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">Also important to all of this was the problem of security.
Often, clever manipulation of interactions between programs in the
two universes could be used to break security. Additionally, a bug
discovered in one universe was often mirrored in the software of
the other, but usually only one got fixed (at first).</P
><p class="para">Eventually, everyone supporting a dual-universe system switched
back to a single version of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>. Nevertheless,
Solaris perpetuates some of these problems. For example, Solaris
has two versions of the <kbd class="command">ls</KBD
> command, one in <kbd class="command">/usr/bin/ls</KBD
>,
one in <kbd class="command">/usr/ucb/ls</KBD
>. It also has two versions
of <kbd class="command">head</KBD
>, <kbd class="command">more</KBD
>, <kbd class="command">ln</KBD
>, <kbd class="command">ps</KBD
>, and many other commands. Thus, you need to
check your search path carefully to know which version of a command
you may be using.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-6405"></A

><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">A <span class="acronym">CDF</SPAN

kind of directory, marked by a bit in its mode (see <kbd class="command">chmod</KBD

name of the <span class="acronym">CDF</SPAN

the contents of the directory are files with names that are expected
to match one part of a process context. When such a directory is
encountered during a pathname search, the names of the files in
the directory are compared with each string in the process's
context, in the order in which the strings appear in the context.
The first match is taken to be the desired file. The name of the
directory thus refers to one of the files within it, and the directory
itself is normally invisible to the user. Hence, the directory is
called a hidden directory.</P
><p class="para">When a process with a context that does not match any filenames
in the hidden directory attempts to access a file by the pathname
of the hidden directory, the reference is unresolved; no file with
that pathname appears to exist...</P

the normal selection according to context, by appending the character
`+' to the directory's file

also find an existing <span class="acronym">CDF</SPAN

an existing context, they would probably never be noticed.</P
