invited one of the authors to a casual tour of one of the company's
main sites. The site, located in an office park with several large
buildings, included computers for product design and testing, nationwide
management of inventory, sales, and customer support. It included
a sophisticated, automated voice-response system costing thousands
of dollars a month to operate; hundreds of users; and dozens of
T1 (1.44 Mbits/sec) communications lines for the corporate
network, carrying both voice and data communications.</P

by walking through this company's base of operations, we
discovered that this company would be an easy target for many attacks&nbsp;- both
complicated and primitive. The attacker might be a corporate spy
for a competing firm, or might simply be a disgruntled employee.
Given the ease of stealing computer equipment, the company also
had reason to fear less-than-honest employees. Without adequate
inventory or other controls, the company might not be able to discover
and prove any wide-scale fraud, nor would they be able to recover
insurance in the event of any loss.</P
><p class="para">Furthermore, despite
the fact that the company thought that it had &quot;nothing
to lose,&quot; an internal estimate had put the cost of computer
downtime at several million dollars per hour because of its use
in customer-service management, order processing, and parts management.
An employee, out for revenge or personal gain, could easily put
a serious dent into this company's bottom line with a small
expenditure of effort, and little chance of being caught.</P

the company had a lot to lose.</P
