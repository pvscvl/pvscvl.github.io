><p class="para">There is a certain irony in trying to include a comprehensive
list of electronic resources in a printed book such as this one.
Electronic resources such as Web pages, newsgroups, and mailing
lists are updated on an hourly basis; new releases of computer programs
can be published every few weeks.</P
><p class="para">Books, on the other hand, are infrequently updated. The first
edition of <em class="emphasis">Practical UNIX Security</EM
>, for instance, was written between
1989 and 1990, and published in 1991. This revised edition was started
in 1995 and not published until 1996. Interim reprintings incorporated
corrections, but did not include new material.</P
><p class="para">Some of the programs listed in this appendix appear to be
&quot;dead,&quot; or, in the vernacular jargon of academia,
&quot;completed.&quot; For instance, consider the case of
<span class="acronym">COPS</SPAN
>, developed as a student project by Dan Farmer
at Purdue University under the direction of Gene Spafford. The <span class="acronym">COPS</SPAN
>
program is still referenced by many first-rate texts on computer
security. But as of early 1996, <span class="acronym">COPS</SPAN
> hasn't
been updated in more than four years and fails to install cleanly
on many major versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX;</SPAN
> Dan Farmer has
long since left Gene's tutelage and gone on to fame, fortune,
and other projects (such as the <span class="acronym">SATAN</SPAN
> tool).
<span class="acronym">COPS</SPAN
> rests moribund on the <span class="acronym">COAST</SPAN
>
<span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
> server, apparently a dead project. Nevertheless,
before this book is revised for a third time, there exists the chance
that someone else will take up <span class="acronym">COPS</SPAN
> and put a
new face on it. And, we note that there is still some value in applying
<span class="acronym">COPS</SPAN
>&nbsp;- some of the flaws that it finds
are <em class="emphasis">still</EM
> present in systems shipped by some
vendors (assuming that you can get the program to compile).</P
><p class="para">We thus present the following electronic resources with the
understanding that this list necessarily cannot be complete nor
completely up to date. What we hope, instead, is that it is expansive.
By reading it, we hope that you will gain insight into places to
look for future developments in computer security. Along the way,
you may find some information you can put to immediate use.</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-40602"></A
>There are
many mailing lists that cover security-related material. We describe
a few of the major ones here. However, this is not to imply that
only these lists are worthy of mention! There may well be other
lists of which we are unaware, and many of the lesser-known lists
often have a higher volume of good information.</P
><blockquote class="note"><p class="para"><strong>NOTE:</STRONG
> <em class="emphasis">Never </EM
>place blind faith in anything
you read in a mailing list, especially if the list is unmoderated.
There are a number of self-styled experts on the net who will not
hesitate to volunteer their views, whether knowledgeable or not.
Usually their advice is benign, but sometimes it is quite dangerous.
There may also be people who are providing bad advice on purpose,
as a form of vandalism. And certainly there are times where the
real experts make a mistake or two in what they recommend in an
offhand note posted to the net.</P
><p class="para">There are some real experts on these lists who are (happily)
willing to share their knowledge with the community, and their contributions
make the Internet a better place. However, keep in mind that simply
because you read it on the network does not mean that the information
is correct for your system or environment, does not mean that it
has been carefully thought out, does not mean that it matches your
site policy, and most certainly does not mean that it will help
your security. <em class="emphasis">Always</EM
> evaluate carefully the
information you receive before acting on it.</P

>Many
of the incident response teams (listed in Appendix F) have mailing
lists for their advisories and alerts. If you can be classified
as one of their constituents, you should contact the appropriate
team(s) to be placed on their mailing lists.</P
><p class="para">Many vendors also have mailing lists for updates and advisories
concerning their products. These include computer vendors, firewall
vendors, and vendors of security software (including some freeware
and shareware products). You may wish to contact your vendors to
see if they have such lists, and if so, join.</P

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="PUIS-APP-E-SECT-1.2">E.1.2 A Big Problem With Mailing Lists</A
></H3
><p class="para">The problem with all these lists is that you can easily overwhelm
yourself. If you are on lists from two response teams, four vendors,
and another half-dozen general-purpose lists, you may find yourself
filtering several hundred messages a day whenever a new general
vulnerability is discovered. At the same time, you don't
want to unsubscribe from these lists, because you might then miss
the timely announcement of a special-case fix for your own systems.</P
><p class="para">One method that we have seen others use with some success
is to split the mailing lists up among a group of administrators.
Each person gets one or two lists to monitor, with particularly
useful messages then redistributed to the entire group. Be certain
to arrange coverage of these lists if someone leaves or goes on
vacation, however!</P
><p class="para">Another approach is to feed these messages into Usenet newsgroups
you create locally especially for this purpose. This strategy allows
you to read the messages using an advanced newsreader that will
allow you to kill message chains or trigger on keywords. It may
also help provide an archiving mechanism to allow you to keep several
days or weeks (or more) of the messages.</P
