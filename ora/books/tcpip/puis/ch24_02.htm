>Killing
your computer's power&nbsp;- turning it off&nbsp;- is
the very quickest way to get an intruder off your computer and prevent
him from doing anything else&nbsp;- including possibly further
damage. Unfortunately, this is a drastic action. Not only does it
stop the intruder, but it also interrupts the work of all of your
legitimate users. It may also delete evidence you night need in
court some day, delete necessary evidence of the break-in, such
as running processes (e.g., <kbd class="command">mailrace</KBD
>), and cause the system to be
damaged when you reboot because of the Trojaned startup scripts.
In addition, the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> filesystem does not deal
with sudden power loss very gracefully: pulling the plug might do
significantly more damage than the intruder might ever do.</P
><p class="para">In some cases, you can get rid of an intruder by politely
asking him or her to leave. Inform the person that breaking into
your computer is both antisocial and illegal. Some computer trespassers
have the motivation of a child sneaking across private property;
they often do not stop to think about the full impact of their actions.
However, don't bet on your intruder being so simplistic,
even if he acts that way. (And keep in mind our warning earlier
in this chapter.)</P
><p class="para">If the person refuses to leave, you can forcibly kill his
or her processes with the <kbd class="command">kill</KBD

><p class="para">You are well-advised to change the password on the account
<em class="emphasis">before </EM

if the intruder is logged in as root. If the intruder is a faster
typist than you are, you might find yourself forced off before you
know it! Also bear in mind that most intruders will install a back
door into the system. Thus, even if you change the password, that
may not be sufficient to keep them off: you may need to take the
system to single-user mode and check the system out, first.</P
><p class="para">As a last resort, you can physically break the connection.
If the intruder has dialed in over a telephone line, you can turn
off the modem&nbsp;- or unplug it from the back of the computer.
If the intruder is connected through the network, you can unplug
the network connector&nbsp;- although this will also interrupt
service for all legitimate users. Once the intruder is off your
machine, try to determine the extent of the damage done (if any),
and seal the holes that let the intruder get in. You also should
check for any new holes that the intruder may have created. This

><p class="para">The following story is true. The names and a few details have
been changed to protect people's jobs.</P
><p class="para">Late one night in November 1995, a part-time computer consultant
at a Seattle-based firm logged into one of the computers that he
occasionally used. The system seemed sluggish, so he ran the <kbd class="command">top</KBD
>
command to get an idea of what was slowing down the system. The
consultant noticed that a program called <kbd class="command">vs</KBD
> was consuming a large
amount of system resources. The program was running as superuser.</P
><p class="para">Something didn't look right. To get more information,
the programmer ran the ps command. That's when things got
stranger still&nbsp;- <em class="emphasis">the mysterious program didn't appear
when ps was run.</EM
> So the occasional system manager used the <kbd class="command">top</KBD
> command
again, and, sure enough, the <kbd class="command">vs</KBD
> program was still running.</P
><p class="para">The programmer suspected a break-in. He started looking around
the filesystem using the Emacs <kbd class="command">dired</KBD
> command and found the <kbd class="command">vs</KBD
> program
in a directory called <i class="filename">/var/.e</I
>. That certainly
didn't look right. So the programmer went to his shell
window, did a <kbd class="command">chdir()</KBD
> to
the <i class="filename">/var</I
> directory, and then did an <kbd class="command">ls -a</KBD
>. But the <kbd class="command">ls</KBD
> program
didn't show the directory <i class="filename">/var/.e</I
>. Nevertheless,
the program was definitely there: it was still visible from the
Emacs <kbd class="command">dired</KBD
> command.</P
><p class="para">The programmer was now pretty sure that somebody had broken
into the computer. And the attack seemed sophisticated, because
system commands appeared to have been altered to hide evidence of
the break-in. Not wanting to let the break-in proceed further, the
operator wanted to shut down the computer. But he was afraid that
the attacker might have booby-trapped the <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-33612"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-33615"></A
>
<i class="filename">/etc/halt</I
>
command to destroy traces of the break-in. So before the programmer
shut down the system, he used the <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-33618"></A
>
<kbd class="command">tar</KBD
>
command to make a copy of the directory <i class="filename">/var/.e,</I
>
as well as the directories <i class="filename">/bin</I
> and <i class="filename">/etc</I
>. As soon
as the <i class="filename">tar </I
>file was made, he copied it to another
computer and halted the system.</P
><p class="para">The following morning, the programmer made the following
observations from the <i class="filename">tar </I
>file:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Somebody had broken into the system.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The program <i class="filename">/bin/login</I
> had been
modified so that anybody on the Internet could log into the <i class="filename">root</I
>
account by trying a special password.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The <i class="filename">/var/.e/vs</I
> program
that had been left running was a password sniffing program. It listened
on the company's local area network for users typing their
passwords; these passwords were then sent to another computer elsewhere
on the Internet.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The program <i class="filename">/bin/ls</I
> and <i class="filename">/bin/ps</I
>
had been modified so that they would not display the directory <i class="filename">/var/.e.</I
></P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The inode creation dates and the modification times
on the files <i class="filename">/bin/ls</I
>, <i class="filename">/bin/ps</I
>
and <i class="filename">/bin/login</I
> had been reset to their original
dates before the modifications took place. The checksums for the
modified commands (as computed with the <kbd class="command">sum</KBD
> command) matched those
of the original, unmodified versions. But a comparison of the programs
with a backup made the previous month revealed that the programs
had been changed.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">It was 10:00 p.m. at night when the break-in was discovered.
Nevertheless, the consultant telephoned the system manager at home.
When he did, he discovered something else:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The computer's system manager
had known about the break-in for three days, but had not done anything
about it. The reason: she feared that the intruder had created numerous
holes in their system's security, and was afraid that if
she angered the intruder, that person might take revenge by deleting
important files or shutting down the system.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">In retrospect, this was rather stupid behavior. Allowing the
intruder to stay on the system let him collect more passwords from
users of the system. The delay also allowed for plenty of time to
make yet further modifications to the system. If it was compromised
before, it was certainly compromised now!</P
><p class="para">Leaving the intruder alone also left the company in a precarious
legal position. If the intruder used the system to break in anywhere
else, the company might be held partially liable in a lawsuit because
they left the intruder with free run of the compromised system.</P
><p class="para">So, what should the system manager have done when she first
discovered the break-in? Basically, the same thing as what the outside
consultant did: take a snapshot of the system to tape or another
disk, isolate the system, and then investigate. If the staff was
worried about some significant files being damaged, they should
have done a complete backup right away to preserve whatever they
could. If the system had been booby-trapped and a power failure
occurred, they would have lost everything as surely as if they had
shut down the system themselves.</P
><p class="para">The case above is typical of many break-ins that have occurred
in 1994 and 1995. The attackers have access to one of many &quot;toolkits&quot;
used to break into systems, install password sniffers, and alter
system programs to hide their presence. Many of the users of these
toolkits are quite ignorant of how they work. Some are even unfamiliar
with <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>: we have heard many stories of monitored
systems compromised with these sophisticated toolkits, only to result
in the intruders attempting to use <span class="acronym">DOS</SPAN
