></H2
><p class="para">Policy helps to define what you consider to be valuable, and
it specifies what steps should be taken to safeguard those assets.</P
><p class="para">Policy can be formulated in a number of different ways. You
could write a very simple, general policy of a few pages that covers
most possibilities. You could also craft a policy for different
sets of assets: a policy for email, a policy for personnel data,
and a policy on accounting information. A third approach, taken
by many large corporations, is to have a small, simple policy augmented
with standards and guidelines for appropriate behavior. We'll
briefly outline this latter approach, with the reader's
understanding that simpler policies can be crafted; more information
is given in the references.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.1">2.4.1 The Role of Policy</A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1610"></A
>Policy plays
three major roles. First, it makes clear what is being protected
and why. Second, it clearly states the responsibility for that protection.
Third, it provides a ground on which to interpret and resolve any
later conflicts that might arise. What the policy should <em class="emphasis">not</EM
>
do is list specific threats, machines, or individuals by name&nbsp;- the
policy should be general and change little over time. For example:</P
><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">Information and information processing facilities
are a critical resource for the Big Whammix Corporation. Information
should be protected commensurate with its value to Big Whammix,
and consistent with applicable law. All employees share in the responsibility
for the protection and supervision of information that is produced,
manipulated, received, or transmitted in their departments. All
employees likewise share in the responsibility for the maintenance,
proper operation, and protection of all information processing resources
of Big Whammix.</P
><p class="para">Information to be protected is any information discovered,
learned, derived, or handled during the course of business that
is not generally known outside of Big Whammix. This includes trade
secret information (ours, and that of other organizations and companies),
patent disclosure information, personnel data, financial information,
information about any business opportunities, and anything else
that conveys an advantage to Big Whammix so long as it is not disclosed.
Personal information about employees, customers, and vendors is
also to be considered confidential and protectable.</P
><p class="para">All information at Big Whammix, however stored&nbsp;- on
computer media, on printouts, in microfilm, on CD-<span class="acronym">ROM</SPAN
>,
on audio or video tape, on photographic media, or in any other stored,
tangible form&nbsp;- is the responsibility of the Chief Information
Honcho (<span class="acronym">CIH</SPAN
>). Thus, Big Whammix facilities should
be used only for functions related to the business of Big Whammix,
as determined by the President. The <span class="acronym">CIH</SPAN
> shall
be responsible for the protection of all information and information
processing capabilities belonging to Big Whammix, whether located
on company property or not. He will have authority to act commensurate
with this responsibility, with the approval of the President of
Big Whammix. The <span class="acronym">CIH</SPAN
> shall formulate appropriate
standards and guidelines, according to good business practice, to
ensure the protection and continued operation of information processing.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Key to note in this example policy is the definition of what
is to be protected, who is responsible for protecting it, and who
is charged with creating additional guidelines. This policy can
be shown to all employees, and to outsiders to explain company policy.
It should remain current no matter what operating system is in use,
or who the <span class="acronym">CIH</SPAN
> may happen to be.</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1627"></A
>Standards are
intended to codify successful practice of security in an organization.
They are generally phrased in terms of &quot;shall.&quot;
Standards are generally platform independent, and at least imply
a metric to determine if they have been met. Standards are developed
in support of policy, and change slowly over time. Standards might
cover such issues as how to screen new hires, how long to keep backups,
and how to test <span class="acronym">UPS</SPAN
> systems.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1632"></A
>For
example, consider a standard for backups. It might state:</P
><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">Backups shall be made of all online data and software
on a regular basis. In no case will backups be done any less often
than once every 72 hours of normal business operation. All backups
should be kept for a period of at least six months; the first backup
in January and July of each year will be kept indefinitely at an
off-site, secured storage location. At least one full backup of
the entire system shall be taken every other week. All backup media
will meet accepted industry standards for its type, to be readable
after a minimum of five years in unattended storage.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">This standard does not name a particular backup mechanism
or software package. It clearly states, however, what is to be stored,
how long it is to be stored, and how often it is to be made.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1639"></A
>Consider
a possible standard for authentication:</P
><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">Every user account on each multiuser machine shall
have only one person authorized to use it. That user will be required
to authenticate his or her identity to the system using some positive
proof of identity. This proof of identity can be through the use
of an approved authentication token or smart card, an approved one-time
password mechanism, or an approved biometric unit. Reusable passwords
will not be used for primary authentication on any machine that
is ever connected to a network or modem, that is portable and carried
off company property, or that is used outside of a private office.</P

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.3">2.4.3 Guidelines</A
></H3
><p class="para">Guidelines are the &quot;should&quot; statements in
policies. The intent of guidelines is to interpret standards for
a particular environment&nbsp;- whether that is a software environment,
or a physical environment. Unlike standards, guidelines may be violated,
if necessary. As the name suggests, guidelines are not usually used
as standards of performance, but as ways to help guide behavior.</P
><p class="para">Here is a typical guideline for backups:</P
><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">Backups on <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>-based machines
should be done with the &quot;dump&quot; program. Backups
should be done nightly, in single-user mode, for systems that are
not in 24-hour production use. Backups for systems in 24-hour production
mode should be made at the shift change closest to midnight, when
the system is less loaded. All backups will be read and verified
immediately after being written.</P
><p class="para">Level 0 dumps will be done for the first backup in January
and July. Level 3 backups should be done on the 1st and 15th of
every month. Level 5 backups should be done every Monday and Thursday
night, unless a level 0 or level 3 backup is done on that day. Level
7 backups should be done every other night except on holidays.</P
><p class="para">Once per week, the administrator will pick a file at random
from some backup made that week. The operator will be required to
recover that file as a test of the backup procedures.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1653"></A
></P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Guidelines tend to be very specific to particular architectures
and even to specific machines. Guidelines also tend to change more
often than do standards, to reflect changing conditions.</P

></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1660"></A
>The
role of policy (and associated standards and guidelines) is to help
protect those items you (collectively) view as important. They do
not need to be overly specific and complicated in most instances.
Sometimes, a simple policy statement is sufficient for your environment,
as in the following example.</P
><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">The use and protection of this system is everyone's
responsibility. Only do things you would want everyone else to do,
too. Respect the privacy of other users. If you find a problem,
fix it yourself or report it right away. Abide by all applicable
laws concerning use of the system. Be responsible for what you do
and always identify yourself. Have fun!</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Other times, a more formal policy, reviewed by a law firm
and various security consultants, is the way you need to go to protect
your assets. Each organization will be different. We know of some
organizations that have volumes of policies, standards, and guidelines
for their <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> systems.</P
><p class="para">There are some key ideas to your policy formation, though,
that need to be mentioned more explicitly. These are in addition
to the two we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.</P
><div class="sect3"><h4 class="sect3"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.4.1">2.4.4.1 Assign an owner</A

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1674"></A
>Every
piece of information and equipment to be protected should have an
assigned &quot;owner.&quot; The owner is the person who
is responsible for the information, including its copying, destruction,
backups, and other aspects of protection. This is also the person
who has some authority with respect to granting access to the information.</P
><p class="para">The problem with security in many environments is that there
is important information that has no clear owner. As a result, users
are never sure who makes decisions about the storage of the information,
or who regulates access to the information. Information sometimes
even disappears without anyone noticing for a long period of time
because there is no &quot;owner&quot; to contact or monitor
the situation.</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1680"></A
>People respond better to
positive statements than to negative ones. Instead of building long
lists of &quot;don't do this&quot; statements,
think how to phrase the same information positively. The abbreviated
policy statement above could have been written as a set of &quot;don'ts&quot;
as follows, but consider how much better it read originally:</P
><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">It's your responsibility not to allow
misuse of the system. Don't do things you wouldn't
want others to do, too. Don't violate the privacy of others.
If you find a problem, don't keep it a secret if you can't
fix it yourself. Don't violate any laws concerning use
of the system. Don't try to shift responsibility for what
you do to someone else and don't hide your identity. Don't
have a bad time!</P

></H4
><p class="para">When writing policies, keep users in mind. They will make
mistakes, and they will misunderstand. The policy should not suggest
that users will be thrown to the wolves if an error occurs.</P
><p class="para">Furthermore, consider that information systems may contain
information about users that they would like to keep somewhat private.
This may include some email, personnel records, and job evaluations.
This material should be protected, too, although you may not be
able to guarantee absolute privacy. Be considerate of users'
needs and feelings.</P

>You would
be wise to include standards for training and retraining of all
users. Every user should have basic security awareness education,
with some form of periodic refresher material (even if the refresher
only involves being given a copy of this book!). Trained and educated
users are less likely to fall for scams and social engineering attacks.
They are also more likely to be happy about security measures if
they understand why they are in place.</P
><p class="para">A crucial part of any security system is giving staff time
and support for additional training and education. There are always
new tools and new threats, new techniques, and new information to
be learned. If staff members are spending 60 hours each week chasing
down phantom PC viruses and doing backups, they will not be as effective
as staff given a few weeks of training time each year. Furthermore,
they are more likely to be happy with their work if they are given
a chance to grow and learn on the job, and are allowed to spend
evenings and weekends with their families instead of trying to catch
up on installing software and making backups.</P
