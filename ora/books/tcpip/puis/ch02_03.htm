>Computing
costs can be very difficult. A simple cost calculation can simply
take into account the cost of repairing or replacing a particular
item. A more sophisticated cost calculation can consider the cost
of having equipment out of service, the cost of added training,
the cost of additional procedures resulting from a loss, the cost
to a company's reputation, and even the cost to a company's
clients. Generally speaking, including more factors in your cost
calculation will increase your effort, but will also increase the
accuracy of your calculations.</P
><p class="para">For most purposes, you do not need to assign an exact value
to each possible risk. Normally, assigning a cost range to each
item is sufficient. For instance, the loss of a dozen blank diskettes
may be classed as &quot;under $500,&quot; while
a destructive fire in your computer room might be classed as &quot;over
$1,000,000.&quot; Some items may actually fall into
the category &quot;irreparable/irreplaceable;&quot;
this could include loss of your entire accounts-due database, or
the death of a key employee.</P
><p class="para">You may want to assign these costs based on a finer scale
of loss than simply &quot;lost/not lost.&quot;
For instance, you might want to assign separate costs for each of
the following categories (these are not in rank order):</P

></H3
><p class="para">Finally, you need to calculate the cost of preventing each
kind of loss.</P
><p class="para">For instance, the cost to recover from a momentary power failure
is probably only that of personnel &quot;downtime&quot;
and the time necessary to reboot. However, the cost of prevention
may be that of buying and installing a <span class="acronym">UPS</SPAN
> system.</P
><p class="para">Costs need to be amortized over the expected lifetime of your
approaches, as appropriate. Deriving these costs may reveal secondary
costs and credits that should also be factored in. For instance,
installing a better fire-suppression system may result in a yearly
decrease in your fire insurance premiums and give you a tax benefit
for capital depreciation. But spending money on a fire-suppression
system means that the money is not available for other purposes,
such as increased employee training, or even investing.t</P
><div class="sidebar"><h4 class="sidebar"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-1539">Cost-Benefit Examples</A
></H4
><p class="para">For example, suppose you have a 0.5% chance of a
single power outage lasting more than a few seconds in any given
year. The expected loss as a result of personnel not being able
to work is $25,000, and the cost of recovery (handling
reboots and disk checks) is expected to be another $10,000
in downtime and personnel costs. Thus, the expected loss and recovery
cost per year is (25000+10000) x .005 = $175.
If the cost of a <span class="acronym">UPS</SPAN
> system that can handle all
your needs is $150,000 and it has an expected lifetime
of ten years, then the cost of avoidance is $15,000 per
year. Clearly, investing in a <span class="acronym">UPS</SPAN
> system at this
location is not cost-effective.</P
><p class="para">As another example, suppose that compromise of a password
by any employee could result in an outsider gaining access to trade
secret information worth $1,000,000. There is no recovery
possible, because the trade secret status would be compromised,
and once lost cannot be regained. You have 50 employees who access
your network while traveling, and the probability of any one of
them accidentally disclosing the password (for example, having it
&quot;sniffed&quot; over the Internet; see <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Defending  Your Accounts">Chapter 8, <cite class="chapter">Defending  Your Accounts</CITE
></A
>)
is 2%. Thus, the probability of at least one password being
disclosed during the year is 63.6%.[4] The expected loss is (1000000+0)
x .636 = $636,000. If the cost of avoidance is
buying a $75 one-time password card for each user (see
<a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Defending  Your Accounts">Chapter 8</A
>), plus a $20,000 software cost, and
the system is good for five years, then the avoidance cost is (50*75
+ 20000) / 5 = $4750 per year.
Buying such a system would clearly be indicated.</P

>At
the conclusion of this exercise, you should have a multi-dimensional
matrix consisting of assets, risks, and possible losses. For each
loss, you should know its probability, the predicted loss, and the
amount of money required to defend against the loss. If you are
very precise, you will also have a probability that your defense
will prove inadequate.</P
><p class="para">The process of determining if each defense should or should
not be employed is now straightforward. You do this by multiplying
each expected loss by the probability of its occurring as a result
of each threat. Sort these in descending order, and compare each
cost of occurrence to its cost of defense.</P
><p class="para">This comparison results in a prioritized list of things you
should address. The list may be surprising. Your goal should be
to avoid expensive, probable losses, before worrying about less
likely, low-damage threats. <em class="emphasis">In many environments, fire
and loss of key personnel are much more likely to occur and more
damaging than a virus or break-in over the network</EM
>. Surprisingly,
however, it is break-ins and viruses that seem to occupy the attention
and budget of most managers. This practice is simply not cost effective,
nor does it provide the highest levels of trust in your overall
system.</P
><p class="para">To figure out what you should do, take the figures that you
have gathered for avoidance and recovery to determine how best to
address your high-priority items. The way to do this is to add the
cost of recovery to the expected average loss, and multiply that
by the probability of occurrence. Then, compare the final product
with the yearly cost of avoidance. If the cost of avoidance is lower
than the risk you are defending against, you would be advised to
invest in the avoidance strategy if you have sufficient financial
resources. If the cost of avoidance is higher than the risk that
you are defending against, then consider doing nothing until after
other threats have been dealt <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1559"></A

><div class="sidebar"><h4 class="sidebar"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-1564">Risk Cannot Be Eliminated</A
></H4
><p class="para">You can identify and reduce risks, but you can never eliminate risk
entirely.</P
><p class="para">For example, you may purchase a <span class="acronym">UPS</SPAN
>
to reduce the risk of a power failure damaging your data. But the
<span class="acronym">UPS</SPAN
> may fail when you need it. The power interruption
may outlast your battery capacity. The cleaning crew may have unplugged
it last week to use the outlet for their floor polisher.</P
><p class="para">A careful risk assessment will identify these <em class="emphasis">secondary
risks </EM
>and help you to plan for them as well. You might,
for instance, purchase a second <span class="acronym">UPS</SPAN
>. But, of
course, both of those units could fail at the same time. There might
even be an interaction between the two units that you did not foresee
when you installed them. The likelihood of a power failure gets
smaller and smaller as you buy more backup power supplies and test
the system, but it never becomes zero.</P
><p class="para">Risk assessment
can help you to protect yourself and your organization against human
risks as well as natural ones. For example, you can use risk assessment
to help protect yourself against computer break-ins, by identifying
the risks and planning accordingly. But, as with power failures,
you cannot completely eliminate the chance of someone breaking in
to your computer.</P
><p class="para">This fact is fundamental to computer
security: No matter how secure you make a computer, it can always
be broken into given sufficient resources, time, motivation, and
money.</P
><p class="para">Even systems that are certified according to
the Department of Defense's &quot;<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1576"></A
>
Orange Book&quot; are vulnerable to break-ins.
One reason is that these systems are sometimes not administered
correctly. Another reason is that some people using them may be
willing to take bribes to violate the security. Computer access
controls do no good if they're not administered properly,
exactly as the lock on a building will do no good if it is the night
watchman who is stealing office equipment at 2 a.m.</P
><p class="para">Indeed,
people are often the weakest link in a security system. The most
secure computer system in the world is wide open if the system administrator
cooperates with those who wish to break into the machine. People
can be compromised with money, threats, or ideological appeals.
People can also make mistakes&nbsp;- like accidentally sending
email containing account passwords to the wrong person.</P
><p class="para">Indeed,
people are usually cheaper and easier to compromise than advanced
technological safeguards.</P

>Security is not
free. The more elaborate your security measures become, the more
expensive they become. Systems that are more secure may also be
more difficult to use, although this need not always be the case.[6]
Security can also get in the way of &quot;power users,&quot;
who wish to exercise many difficult and sometimes dangerous operations
without authentication or accountability. Some of these power users
can be politically powerful within your organization.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[6] The converse is also not true. PC operating systems are not
secure, even though some are difficult to use.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">After you have completed your risk assessment and cost-benefit
analysis, you will need to convince your organization's
management of the need to act upon the information. Normally, you
would formulate a policy that is then officially adopted. Frequently,
this process is an uphill battle. Fortunately, it does not have
to be.</P
><p class="para">The goal of risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis is to
prioritize your actions and spending on security. If your business
plan is such that you should not have an uninsured risk of more
than $10,000 per year, you can use your risk analysis to
determine what needs to be spent to achieve this goal. Your analysis
can also be a guide as to what to do first, then second, and can
identify which things you should relegate to later years.</P
><p class="para">Another benefit of risk assessment is that it helps to justify
to management that you need additional resources for security. Most
managers and directors know little about computers, but they do
understand risk and cost/benefit analyses.[7] If you can show that
your organization is currently facing an exposure to risk that could
total $20,000,000 per year (add up all the expected losses
plus recovery costs for what is currently in place), then this estimate
might help convince management to fund some additional personnel
and resources.</P
