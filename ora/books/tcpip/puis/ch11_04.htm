>The most important question that arises
in our discussion of programmed threats is: How do these threats
find their way into your computer system and reproduce? Most back
doors, logic bombs, Trojan horses, and bacteria appear on your system
because they were written there. Perhaps the biggest security threat
to a computer system is its own user group. Users understand the
system, know its weaknesses, and know the auditing and control systems
that are in place. Legitimate users often have access with sufficient
privilege to write and introduce malicious code into the system.
Especially ironic, perhaps, is the idea that at many companies the
person responsible for security and control is also the person who
could cause the most damage if he wished to issue the appropriate
commands.</P
><p class="para">Users also may be unwitting agents of transmission
for viruses, worms, and other such threats. They may install new
software from outside, and install embedded malicious code at the
same time. Software obtained from public domain sources traditionally
has been a source of system infection. Not all public domain software
is contaminated, of course; most of it is not. Commercial products
also have been known to be infected. The real difficulties occur
when employees do not understand the potential problems that may
result from the introduction of software that has not been checked
thoroughly, no matter what its source. Such software includes the
&quot;click-and-download&quot; paradigm of <span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
>
browsers.</P
><p class="para">A third possible method of entry occurs if
a machine is connected to a <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15123"></A
>
network or some other means of computer-to-computer
communication. Programs may be written on the outside and find their
way into a machine through these connections. This is the way worms
usually enter systems. Worms may carry logic bombs or viruses with
them, thus introducing those problems into the computer at the same
time.</P
><p class="para">Programmed threats can easily enter most machines.
Environments with poor controls abound, caused in part by the general
lack of security training and expertise within the computing community.
Few college-level programs in computer science and computer engineering
even offer an elective in computer security (or computer ethics),
so few computer users&nbsp;- even those with extensive training&nbsp;- have
the background to help safeguard their systems.</P
><p class="para">No
matter how the systems initially became infected, the situation
is usually made worse when the software spreads throughout all susceptible
systems within the same office or plant. Most systems are configured
to trust the users, machines, and services in the local environment.
Thus, there are even fewer restrictions and restraints in place
to prevent the spread of malicious software within a local cluster
or network of computers. Because the users of such an environment
often share resources (including programs, diskettes, and even workstations),
the spread of malicious software within such an environment is hastened
considerably. Eradicating malicious software from such an environment
is also more difficult because identifying all sources of the problem
is almost impossible, as is purging all those locations at the same
time.</P
