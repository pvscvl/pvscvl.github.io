>When you operate
a computer, you have more to fear than break-ins and physical disasters.
You also need to worry that the actions of some of your own users
(or yourself) may result in violation of the law, or civil action.
Here, we present a few notable concerns in this area.</P
><p class="para">The
law is changing rapidly in the areas of computer use and abuse.
It is also changing rapidly with regard to networks and network
communication. We cannot hope to provide information here that will
be up-to-date for very long. For instance, one outstanding reference
in this area, Internet &amp; Network Law 1995, by William J.
Cook[5]
summarizes some of the recent rulings in
computer and network law in the year 1995. Mr. Cook's report
has almost 70 pages of case summaries and incidents, all of which
represent recent decisions. As more people use computers and networks,
and as more commercial interests are tied into computing, we can
expect the pace of new legislation, legal decisions, and other actions
to increase. Therefore, as with any other aspect of the law, you
are advised to seek competent legal counsel if you have any questions
about whether these concerns may apply to you.[6]
Keep in mind that the law functions with a logic all its own&nbsp;- one
that is puzzling and confounding to people who work with software.
The law is not necessarily logical and fair, nor does it always
embody common sense.</P

don't make it a one-time visit, either. With the rapid
pace of change, you need to track the changes if there is any chance
that you might be affected by adverse changes in the law.</P

the law and you may encounter problems if you are in violation.</P

encryption
software outside the country, or makes it available to foreign nationals
who are not permanent residents, is in violation of the statutes
unless a license is obtained first; such licenses are notoriously
difficult to obtain. It may also be the case that granting access
to certain forms of advanced supercomputing equipment (even granting
accounts) to foreign nationals is in violation of the law.</P
><p class="para">You
may believe that you are not exporting any prohibited software.
However, stop and think for a moment. Does your anonymous <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN
>
repository contain encryption software of any kind? Does your <span class="acronym">WWW</SPAN
>
server have any pages with encryption software? Do you run a mailing
list or remailer that can be used to send encryption software outside
the U.S.? If the answer to any of those is &quot;yes,&quot;
you should consider seeking legal advice on this issue as you may
be classified as an &quot;exporter.&quot; Violation of the
export control acts are punishable (upon conviction) with hefty
fines and long jail terms.</P

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35442"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35445"></A
>A further potential
violation involves access to the software by non-citizens. If any
of your employees (or students) are not U.S. citizens or permanent
residents, and if they have access to encryption software or advanced
computing hardware, you are likely to be in violation of the law.
Note that one interpretation of the law implies that if you only
provide an account that is used by someone else to obtain controlled
software you may still be liable. (If you do, you are probably in
good company, because nearly all major universities and software
vendors in the country are in the same position. This fact may be
little comfort if Federal agents show up at your door, however.)</P
><p class="para">An even more bizarre and interesting aspect of the law indicates
that you may be in violation of the export control laws if you provide
encryption software to U.S. citizens living and working in the U.S.&nbsp;- provided
that they are working for a company under non-U.S. control. Thus,
even if you are a U.S. citizen, and you download a copy of <span class="acronym">PGP</SPAN
>
or <span class="acronym">DES</SPAN
> to your workstation in your office (in
Washington, Chicago, Atlanta, Houston, Phoenix, Portland, Los Angeles,
Fairbanks, or Honolulu), you are now an international arms exporter
and potential criminal if your company is majority owned or controlled
by parties outside the U.S. This liability is personal, not corporate.</P
><p class="para">The whole matter of export controls on encryption software
is under study by various government groups, and is the subject
of several lawsuits in Federal court. The status of this situation
will undoubtedly change in the next few years. We hope that it will
change to something more reasonable, but you should be sure to stay
informed.</P

Software Publishers Association (<span class="acronym">SPA</SPAN
>)
is one of several organizations funded by major software publishers.
One of its primary goals is to cut down on the huge amount of software
piracy that is regularly conducted worldwide. Although each individual
act of unauthorized software copying and use may only deprive the
vendor of a few hundred dollars at most, the sheer numbers of software
pirates in operation makes the aggregate losses staggering: worldwide
losses are estimated in the billions of dollars per year. Figures
from various sources cited by Mr. Cook in Internet &amp; Network
Law 1995 indicate:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Worldwide losses from software piracy
alone may be as high as $15 billion per year.</P

><li class="listitem"><p class="para">94% of the software in the Peoples Republic

></LI
></UL
><p class="para">Although there are
criminal penalties for unauthorized copying, these penalties are
only employed against organized software piracy organizations. Instead,
<span class="acronym">SPA</SPAN
> and others rely on civil-law remedies. In
particular, the <span class="acronym">SPA</SPAN
> can obtain a court order
to examine your computer systems for evidence of unlicensed copies
of software. Should such copies be found without supporting documentation
to show valid licenses, you may be subject to a lawsuit resulting
in substantial damages. Many companies and universities have settled
with the <span class="acronym">SPA</SPAN

fines totaling in the many hundreds of thousands of dollars. This
amount is in addition to the many thousands of dollars paid to vendors
for any unlicensed software that is found.</P
><p class="para">Although
the <span class="acronym">SPA</SPAN

piracy in the PC domain, they will probably expand their scope into
the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

concern are the new generations of emulators that let your <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

machine operate as a &quot;PC&quot; inside a window on your
workstation. These emulators run PC software as well as (and sometimes
faster than) a plain desktop PC. The danger is having unlicensed
PC software on your workstations for use in these emulators.</P
><p class="para">A further danger involves your users. If some of your users
are running a clandestine &quot;warez&quot; site from your
<span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN

might conceivably seek financial redress from you to help cover
the loss, even if you do not know about the server and otherwise
don't condone the behavior.[7]</P

><p class="para">Your best defense in these
circumstances is to clearly state to your users that no unlicensed
use or possession of software is allowed under any circumstances.
Having internal audits of software is one way you can check compliance
with this policy. If software cannot be documented as paid for and
original, then it should be deleted. Having up-to-date and per-machine
log books is one way to track versions of software.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35536"></A

mentioned patent concerns elsewhere in the book. Firms and individuals
are applying for (and receiving) patents on software and algorithms
at an astonishing rate. Despite the wording of the Constitution
and laws on patents, the Patent Office is continuing to award patents
on obvious ideas, trivial advances, and pure algorithms. In the
middle of 1995, they effectively granted patent protection to a
prime number as well![8]</P

is easier (and more practical) to generate a &quot;random&quot;
prime number than to use this one.</P

by their patent. After a patent is granted, the patent holder controls
the use of the patented item for 20 years from the date of filing&nbsp;- you
aren't even supposed to use it for experimental purposes
without their approval and/or license!</P

is presented, pornography and erotica seem to be distributed using

positions of political and legal influence who believe that they

restrict access to that material. This belief, coupled with the
fact that U.S. standards of acceptability of nudity and erotic language
are more strict than in many places in the world, lead to conflict
on the networks.</P
><p class="para">As this book goes to press, Congress
has passed a law that makes it a criminal offense to put &quot;indecent&quot;
material on a computer where a minor might encounter it. We have
also heard of cases in which people have had their computers confiscated
for having a computer image on disk, which they were unaware was
present, that depicted activities that someone decided violated
&quot;community standards.&quot; There have also been cases
where individuals in one state have been convicted of pornography
charges in another state, even though the material was not considered
obscene in the state where the system was normally accessed. And
last of all, you can be in serious legal trouble for simply <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN

laws are currently being applied selectively. In several cases,
individuals have been arrested for downloading child pornography
from several major online service providers. In the United States,
the mere possession of child pornography is a crime. Yet the online
service providers have not been harassed by law enforcement, even
though the same child pornography resided on the online services'
systems.</P

simply to intimidate and cause economic hardship: this is not prohibited
