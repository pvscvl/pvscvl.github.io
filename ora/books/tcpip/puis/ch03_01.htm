>Good
password security is part of your first line of defenses against
system abuse.[1] People
trying to gain unauthorized access to your system often try to guess
the passwords of legitimate users. Two common and related ways to
do this are by trying many possible passwords from a database of
common passwords, and by stealing a copy of your organization's
password file and trying to <i class="firstterm">crack</I
> the encrypted
passwords that it contains.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[1] Another part of your first line of
defense is physical security, which may prevent an attacker from
simply carting your server through the lobby without being questioned.
See <a class="xref" href="ch12_01.htm" title="Physical Security">Chapter 12, <cite class="chapter">Physical Security</CITE
></A
> for details.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">After an attacker gains initial access, he or she is free
to snoop around, looking for other security holes to exploit to
attain successively higher privileges. The best way to keep your
system secure is to keep unauthorized users out of the system in
the first place. This means teaching your users what good password
security means and making sure they adhere to good security practices.</P
><p class="para">Sometimes even good passwords aren't sufficient.
This is especially true in cases where passwords need to travel
across unprotected networks. With default network protocols and
defenses, these passwords may be <i class="firstterm"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1891"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1894"></A
>sniffed</I
>&nbsp;- read
from the network by someone not authorized to know the passwords.
In cases of this kind, one-time passwords are necessary.</P

>Every
person who uses a <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

<i class="filename">account</I
>. An account is identified by a <i class="firstterm">username.</I
>
Traditionally, each account also has a secret <i class="firstterm">password</I
> associated with it to prevent unauthorized use. Usernames
are sometimes called <i class="firstterm"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1908"></A
>account names</I
>. You need
to know both your username and your password to log into a <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
system. For example, Rachel Cohen has an account on her university's
computer system. Her username is rachel. Her password is &quot;Iluvfred.&quot;
When she wants to log into the university's computer system,
she types:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">login: rachel
password: Iluvfred</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">The username is an <i class="firstterm"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1916"></A

<i class="filename">authenticator</I

system that you are who you claim to be.</P
><p class="para">Standard <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> usernames may be between
one and eight characters long. Within a single <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
computer, usernames must be unique: no two users can have the same
one. (If two people did have the same username, then they would
really be sharing the same account.) <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> passwords
are also between one and eight characters long, although some commercial
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> systems now allow longer passwords. Longer
passwords are usually more secure because they are harder to guess.
More than one user can theoretically have the same password, although
if they do, that indicates that <em class="emphasis">both</EM
> users
have picked a bad password.</P
><p class="para">A single person can have more than one <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
account on the same computer. In this case, each account would have
its own username. A username can be any sequence of characters you
want (with some exceptions), and does not necessarily correspond
to a real person's name.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1929"></A

><blockquote class="note"><p class="para"><strong>NOTE:</STRONG
> Some versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> have problems
with usernames that do not start with a lowercase letter or that
contain special characters such as punctuation or control characters.
Usernames containing certain unusual characters will also cause
problems for various application programs, including some network
mail programs. For this reason, many sites allow only usernames
that contain lowercase letters and numbers and that start with a
lowercase letter.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Your username identifies you to<span class="acronym"> UNIX </SPAN
>the
same way your first name identifies you to your friends. When you
log into the <span class="acronym">UNIX </SPAN
>system, you tell it your username
the same way you might say, &quot;Hello, this is Sabrina,&quot;
when you pick up the telephone.[2]
When somebody sends you electronic mail, they send it addressed
with your username. For this reason, organizations that have more
than one computer often require people to have the same username
on every machine, primarily to minimize confusion with electronic
mail.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[2] Even if you aren't
Sabrina, saying that you are Sabrina identifies you as Sabrina.
Of course, if you are not Sabrina, your voice will probably not
<i class="firstterm">authenticate</I

the person you are speaking with knows what Sabrina sounds like.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">There is considerable flexibility in choosing a username.
For example, John Q. Random might have any of the following usernames;
they are all potentially valid:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">john johnqr johnr jqr jqrandom jrandom random randomjq</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Alternatively, John might have a username that appears totally
unrelated to his real name, like <i class="systemitem.username">avocado</I
>
or <i class="systemitem.username">t42</I
>. Having a username
similar to your own name is merely a matter of convenience.</P
><p class="para">Most organizations require that usernames be at least three
characters long. Usernames that are only one or two characters are
valid, but they are usually discouraged. Single-character usernames
are simply too confusing for most people to deal with, no matter
how easy you might think it would be to be user &quot;i&quot;
or &quot;x&quot;. Usernames that are two characters long
are easily confused between different sites: is <a class="email" href="mailto:mg@unipress.com">mg@unipress.com</A
> the same person
as <a class="email" href="mailto:mg@aol.com">mg@aol.com</A
>? Names
with little intrinsic meaning, such as <i class="systemitem.username">t42</I
>
and <i class="systemitem.username">xp9uu6wl</I
>, can also
cause confusion, because they are more difficult for correspondents
to remember.</P
><p class="para">Some organizations assign usernames consisting of a person's
last name (sometimes with an optional initial). Other organizations
let users pick their own names. A few organizations and online services
assign an apparently random string of characters as the usernames,
although this is not often popular with users or their correspondents:
user <i class="systemitem.username">xp9uu6wl</I
> may get
quite annoyed at continually getting mail misaddressed for <i class="systemitem.username">xp9uu6wi</I
>, assuming that anyone
can remember either username at all.</P
><p class="para"><span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> also has special accounts which are
used for administrative purposes and special system functions. These
accounts are not normally used by individual users, as you will
see shortly. <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1957"></A
