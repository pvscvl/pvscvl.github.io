><p class="para"><span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
> and other distributed filesystems provide
some wonderful functions. They are also a source of continuing headaches.
You should consider the question of whether you really need all
the flexibility and power of <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
> and distributed
systems. By reexamining your fundamental assumptions, you may find
that you can reconfigure your systems to avoid <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
>
problems completely, by eliminating <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
>.</P
><p class="para">For instance, one reason that is often given for having <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
>
is to easily keep software in sync on many machines at once. However,
that argument was more valid before the days of high-speed local
networks and cheap disks. You might be better served by equipping
each workstation in your enterprise with a 2GB or 4GB disk, with
a complete copy of all of your applications residing on each machine.
You can use a facility such as <kbd class="command">rdist</KBD
> (see Chapter
9) to make necessary updates. Not only will this configuration give
you better security, but it will also provide better fault tolerance:
if the server or network goes down, each system has everything necessary
to continue operation. This configuration also facilitates system
customization.</P
><p class="para">A second argument for network filesystems is that they allow
users to access their home accounts with greater ease, no matter
which machine they use. But while this may make sense in a university
student lab, most employees almost always use the same machine,
so there is no reason to access multiple machines as if they were
equivalent.</P
><p class="para">Network filesystems are sometimes used to share large databases
from multiple points. But network filesystems are a poor choice
for this application because locking the database and synchronizing
updates is usually more difficult than sharing a single machine
using remote logins. In fact, with the X Window System, opening
a window on a central database machine is convenient and often as
fast (or faster) than accessing the data via a network filesystem.
Alternatively, you can use a database server, with client programs
that are run locally.</P
><p class="para">The argument is also made that sharing filesystems over the
network results in lower cost. In point of fact, such a configuration
may be <em class="emphasis">more expensive</EM
> than the alternatives.
For instance, putting high-resolution color X display terminals
on each desktop and connecting them with 100MB Ethernet to a multiprocessor
server equipped with <span class="acronym">RAID</SPAN
> disk may be more cost-effective,
provide better security, give better performance, and use less electricity.
The result may be a system that is cheaper to buy, operate, and
maintain. The only loss is the cachet of equipping each user with
a top-of-the-line workstation on his desktop when all he really
needs is access to a keyboard, mouse, and fast display.</P
><p class="para">Indeed, the only argument for network filesystems may be security.
Today most X terminals have no support for encryption.[13] On client/server-based
systems that use Kerberos or <span class="acronym">DCE, </SPAN
>you can avoid
sending unencrypted passwords and user data over the network. But
be careful: you will only get the data confidentiality aspects of
this approach if your remote filesystem encrypts all user data;
most don't.</P
