>A bad password is any password that is easily
guessed.</P
><p class="para">In the movie Real Genius, a computer recluse named Laszlo
Hollyfeld breaks into a top-secret military computer over the telephone
by guessing passwords. Laszlo starts by typing the password <i class="filename">AAAAAA</I
>,
then trying <i class="filename">AAAAAB</I
>, then <i class="filename">AAAAAC</I
>,
and so on, until he finally finds the password that matches.</P
><p class="para">Real-life computer crackers are far more sophisticated. Instead
of typing each password by hand, crackers use their computers to
make phone calls (or opening network connections) and try the passwords,
automatically retrying when they are disconnected. Instead of trying
every combination of letters, starting with <i class="filename">AAAAAA </I
>(or
whatever), crackers use <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2408"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2410"></A
>
hit lists of common passwords such as <i class="systemitem.password">wizard</I
> or <i class="systemitem.password">demo</I
>. Even a modest home computer
with a good password guessing program can try thousands of passwords
in less than a day's time. Some hit lists used by crackers
are several hundred thousand words in length.[8]
Therefore, a password that <em class="emphasis">anybody</EM
> else might
use for his own password is probably a bad choice for you.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[8] In
contrast, if you were to program a home computer to try all 6-letter
combinations from<i class="filename"> AAAAAA</I
> to <i class="filename">ZZZZZZ</I
>,
it would have to try 308,915,776 different passwords. Guessing one
password per second, that would require nearly ten years.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">What's a popular and bad password? Some examples
are your name, your partner's name, or your parents'
names. Other bad passwords are these names backwards or followed
by a single digit. Short passwords are also bad, because there are
fewer of them: they are, therefore, more easily guessed. Especially
bad are &quot;magic words&quot; from computer games, such
as <i class="systemitem.username">xyzzy</I
>. They look
secret and unguessable, but in fact are widely known. Other bad
choices include phone numbers, characters from your favorite movies
or books, local landmark names, favorite drinks, or famous computer
scientists (see the sidebar later in this chapter for still more
bad choices). These words backwards or capitalized are also weak.
Replacing the letter &quot;l&quot; (lowercase &quot;L&quot;)
with &quot;1&quot; (numeral one), or &quot;E&quot;
with &quot;3,&quot; adding a digit to either end, or other
simple modifications of common words are also weak. Words in other
languages are no better. Dictionaries for dozens of languages are
available for download on the Internet and dozens of bulletin board
systems.</P
><p class="para">Many versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> make a minimal attempt
to prevent users from picking bad passwords. For example, under
some versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>, if you attempt to pick
a password with fewer than six letters that are all of the same
case, the <kbd class="command">passwd</KBD
> program will ask the user to &quot;Please use
a longer password.&quot; After three tries, however, the program
relents and lets the user pick a short one. Better versions allow
the administrator to require a minimum number of letters, a requirement
for nonalphabetic characters, and other restrictions. However, some
administrators turn these requirements off because users complain
about them; this is a bad idea. Users will complain more loudly
if their computers are broken into.</P

>Surprisingly, experts believe that a
significant percentage of all computers without password content
controls contain at least one account where the username and the
password are the same. Such accounts are often called &quot;Joes.&quot;
Joe accounts are easy for crackers to find and trivial to penetrate.
Most computer crackers can find an entry point into almost any system
simply by checking every account to see whether it is a Joe account.
This is one reason why it is dangerous for your computer to make
a list of all of the valid usernames available to the outside world.</P

>If you have several computer accounts, you
may wish to have the same password on every machine, so you have
less you need to remember. However, if you have the same password
on many machines and one of those machines is compromised, all of
your accounts are compromised. One common approach used by people
with accounts on many machines is to have a base password that can
be modified for each different machine. For example, your base password

>There is a tired story about a high school student
who broke into his school's academic computer and changed
his grades; he did this by walking into the school's office,
looking at the academic officer's terminal, and writing
down the telephone number, username, and password that were printed
on a Post-It note.</P
><p class="para">Unfortunately, the story is true&nbsp;- hundreds of times
over.</P
><p class="para">Users are admonished to &quot;never write down your password.&quot;
The reason is simple enough: if you write down your password, somebody
else can find it and use it to break into your computer. A password
that is memorized is more secure than the same password written
down, simply because there is less opportunity for other people
to learn it. On the other hand, a password that <em class="emphasis">must</EM
>
be written down to be remembered is quite likely a password that
is not going to be guessed easily. If you write your password on
something kept in your wallet, the chances of somebody who steals
your wallet using the password to break into your computer account
are remote indeed.[10]</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[10] Unless, of course, you happen
to be an important person, and your wallet is stolen or rifled as
part of an elaborate plot. In their book <em class="emphasis">Cyberpunks</EM
>,
authors John Markoff and Katie Hafner describe a woman called &quot;Susan
Thunder&quot; who broke into military computers by doing just
that: she would pick up officers at bars and go home with them.
Later that night, while the officer was sleeping, Thunder would
get up, go through the man's wallet, and look for telephone
numbers, usernames, and passwords.</P

><p class="para">If you must write down your password, then at least follow
a few precautions:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">When you write it down, don't
identify your password as being a password.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Don't include the name of the account,
network name, or the phone number of the computer on the same piece
of paper as your password.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Don't attach the password to your terminal,
keyboard, or any part of your computer.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Don't write your actual password. Instead,
disguise it, by mixing in other characters or by scrambling the
written version of the password in a way that you can remember.
For example, if your password is &quot;Iluvfred&quot;, you
might write &quot;fredIluv&quot; or &quot;vfredxyIu&quot;
or perhaps &quot;Last week, I lost Uncle Vernon's `fried

>Alec Muffett, the author of the Crack program
(discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Defending  Your Accounts">Chapter 8</A

the reuse of passwords, in more than one place, which we paraphrase
here.</P
><p class="para">A student friend of Alec's (call him Bob) spent a
co-op year at a major computer company site. During his vacations
and on holidays, he'd come back to school and play Aber<span class="acronym">MUD</SPAN
>
(a network-based game) on Alec's computer. One of Bob's
responsibilities at the company involved system management. The
company was concerned about security, so all passwords were random
strings of letters with no sensible pattern or order.</P
><p class="para">One day, Alec fed the Aber<span class="acronym">MUD</SPAN
> passwords
into his development version of the Crack program as a dictionary,
because they were stored on his machine as plain text. He then ran
this file against his system user-password file, and found a few
student account passwords. He had the students change their passwords,
and he then forgot about the matter.</P
><p class="para">Some time later, Alec posted a revised version of the Crack
program and associated files to the Usenet. They ended up in one
of the sources newsgroups and were distributed quite widely. Eventually,
after a trip of thousands of miles around the world, they came to
Bob's company. Bob, being a concerned administrator, decided
to download the files and check them against his company's
passwords. Imagine Bob's shock and horror when the widely
distributed Crack promptly churned out a match for his randomly
chosen, super-secret root password!</P
><p class="para">The moral of the story is that you should teach your users
to <em class="emphasis">never</EM

applications or on other systems outside the same administrative
domain. They never know when those passwords might come back to
haunt them! (And programs like Aber<span class="acronym">MUD</SPAN
