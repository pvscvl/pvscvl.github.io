>You may have studied this book diligently
and taken every reasonable step toward protecting your system, yet
someone still abused it. Perhaps an ex-employee has broken in through
an old account and has deleted some records. Perhaps someone from
outside continues to try to break into your system despite warnings
that they should stop. What recourse do you have through the courts?
Furthermore, what are some of the particular dangers you may face
from the legal system during the normal operation of your computer
system? What happens if <em class="emphasis">you</EM
> are the target
of legal action?</P
><p class="para">This chapter attempts to illuminate
some of these issues. The material we present should be viewed as
general advice, and not as legal opinion: for that, you should contact
good legal counsel and have them advise you.</P

>You
have a variety of different recourses under the U.S. legal system
for dealing with a break-in. A brief chapter such as this one cannot
advise you on the subtle aspects of the law. Every situation is
different. Furthermore, there are differences between state and
Federal law, as well as different laws that apply to computer systems
used for different purposes. Laws outside the U.S. vary considerably
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; we won't attempt to
explain anything beyond the U.S. system.[1]</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[1] An excellent
discussion of legal issues in the U.S. can be found in 
<em class="emphasis">Computer Crime: A Crimefighter's Handbook</EM
> (O'Reilly &amp;
Associates. 1995), and we suggest you start there if you need more
explanation than we provide in this chapter.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">You should discuss your specific situation with a competent
lawyer before pursuing <em class="emphasis">any</EM
> legal recourse. As there are difficulties
and dangers associated with legal approaches, you should also be
sure that you want to pursue this course of action before you go
ahead.</P
><p class="para">In some cases, you may have no choice; you
may be required to pursue legal means. For example:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If you want to file a claim against
your <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35060"></A
>
insurance policy to receive
money for damages resulting from a break-in, you may be required
by your insurance company to pursue criminal or civil actions against
the perpetrators.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If you are involved with <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35064"></A
>
classified data processing, you may be required
by government regulations to report and investigate suspicious activity.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If you are aware of criminal activity and you do
not report it (and especially if your computer is being used for
that activity), you may be criminally liable as an accessory.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If your computer is being used for certain forms
of unlawful or inappropriate activity and you do not take definitive
action, you may be named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit seeking
punitive damages for that activity.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If you are an executive and decide not to investigate
and prosecute illegal activity, shareholders in your corporation
can bring suit against you.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">If
you believe that your system is at risk, you should probably seek
legal advice before a break-in actually occurs. By doing so, you
will know ahead of time the course of action to take if an incident
occurs.</P
><p class="para">To give you some starting points for discussion,
this chapter provides an overview of the two primary legal approaches
you can employ, and some of the features and difficulties that accompany
each one.</P
