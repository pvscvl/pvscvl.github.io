1991, the only thing that most Americans knew about <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

the Internet was that it was the venue that had been besieged by
a &quot;computer virus&quot; in 1988. Today, more than 10 million Americans
use the Internet on a regular basis to send electronic mail, cruise
the World Wide Web, and even shop. In 1991, we called the Internet
a &quot;global village.&quot; Today, it is an Information Highway that's getting
larger and more crowded by the minute, with millions of users from
hundreds of countries on all seven continents electronically connected
to each other.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-41"></A

><p class="para">And yet, despite our greater
reliance on network computing, the Internet isn't a safer place
today than it was in 1991. If anything, the Internet is quickly
becoming the Wild West of cyberspace. Although academics and industry
leaders have long known about fundamental vulnerabilities of computers
connected to the Internet, these flaws have been accommodated rather than
corrected. As a result, we have seen many cases within the past
few years of wide-scale security infractions throughout the network;
in one single case, more than 30,000 people had their passwords
stolen and accounts compromised; in another, more than 20,000 credit
card numbers were allegedly stolen from one company in a single
unauthorized access.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-51"></A

and the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young conducted a survey of
major companies in America and found that more than 20 had lost
more than $1 million worth of information as a result of a security
lapse in the previous two years. The survey also found that more
than 80% had a full-time information security director, and nearly
70% thought that the computer security threat to companies had increased
within the past five years. </P
><p class="para">What do all of these numbers mean
for <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

> as
the operating system of choice on the Internet, and its prevalence
in client/server environments, it is undoubtedly the case that many 
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> machines were involved in these incidents.
Because of its continuing use in these environments, <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> may
be involved in the majority of incidents yet to come-the statistics
and trends are disturbing. We hope that this new edition of our
book helps limit the scope and number of these new incidents.</P

><p class="para">When the first version
of this book appeared in 1991, many people thought that the words
&quot;<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> security&quot; were an oxymoron-two words that
appeared to contradict each other, much like the words &quot;jumbo shrimp&quot;
or &quot;Congressional action.&quot; After all, the ease with which a <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> guru
could break into a system, seize control, and wreak havoc was legendary
in the computer community. Some people couldn't even imagine that
a computer running <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> could be made secure. </P
><p class="para">Since then, the whole world of computers has changed. These
days, many people regard <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> as a relatively
secure operating system...at least, they use <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> as
if it were. Today, <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> is used by millions of
people and many thousands of organizations around the world, all
without obvious major mishap. And while <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> was
not designed with military-level security in mind, it was built
both to withstand limited external attacks and to protect users
from the accidental or malicious actions of other users on the system.
Years of constant use and study have made the operating system even
more secure, because most of the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> security
faults are publicized and fixed.</P
><p class="para">But the truth is, 
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> really hasn't become significantly more
secure with its increase in popularity. That's because fundamental
flaws still remain in the interaction of the operating system's design
and its uses. The <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> superuser remains a single
point of attack: any intruder or insider who can become the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> superuser
can take over the system, booby-trap its programs, and hold the
computer's users hostage-sometimes even without their knowledge.</P
><p class="para">One thing that has improved is our understanding of how to
keep a computer relatively secure. In recent years, a wide variety
of tools and techniques have been developed with the single goal
of helping system administrators secure their <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> computers.
Another thing that's changed is the level of understanding of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> by
system administrators: now it is relatively easy for companies and
other organizations to hire a professional system manager who will
be concerned about computer security and make it a top priority.</P

><p class="para">This book is a <em class="emphasis">practical</EM
> guide
to <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

security is, describe some of the dangers that you may face, and
tell you how to keep your data safe and sound. For administrators,
we explain in greater detail how <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

mechanisms work and tell how to configure and administer your computer
for maximum protection. For everybody, we try to teach something
about <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

to keep yourself from getting burned.</P

you will find many tips for running your computer more securely. Even
if you're a casual user of a <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

should read this book. If you are a complete novice at <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

you will benefit from reading this book, because it contains a thorough
overview of the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

(But you might want to read some other O'Reilly books first; consult <a class="xref" href="appd_01.htm" title="Paper Sources">Appendix D, <cite class="appendix">Paper Sources</CITE

><p class="para">What we've
done here has been to collect helpful information concerning how
to secure your <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> system against threats, both internal
and external. Most of the material is intended for a <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> system
administrator or manager. In most cases, we've presented material
and commands without explaining in any detail how they work, and
in several cases we've simply pointed out the nature of the commands
and files that need to be examined; we've assumed that a typical
system administrator is familiar with the commands and files of
his or her system, or at least has the manuals available to study.</P
><div class="sidebar"><h4 class="sidebar"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-165">A Note About Your Manuals</A
></H4
><p class="para">Some people may think that it is a cop-out for a book on computer
security to advise the reader to read his or her system manuals.
But it's not. The fact is, computer vendors change their software
much faster (and with less notice) than publishers bring out new editions
of books. If you are concerned about running <em class="emphasis">your</EM
> computer
securely, then you should spend the extra time to read your manuals
to verify what we say. You should also experiment with your running
system, to make sure that the programs behave the way they are documented.</P
><p class="para">Thus, we recommend that you go back and read through the manuals
every few months to stay familiar with your system. Sometimes rereading
the manuals after gaining new experience gives you added insight.
Other times it reminds you of useful features that you aren't yet
using. Many successful system administrators have told us that they
make it a point to reread all their manuals every 6 to 12 months!</P

than the rest, with a novice user in mind. We have done this for
two reasons: to be sure that important <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

concepts are presented to the fullest and to make important sections
(such as the ones on file permissions and passwords) readable on
their own. That way, this book can be passed around with a note
saying, &quot;Read <a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="Users and Passwords">Chapter 3, <cite class="chapter">Users and Passwords</CITE

mechanisms for <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

a chapter on how to write more secure programs. </P
><p class="para">We've
also tried to minimize the amount of information in this book that
would be useful to people trying to break into computer systems.
If that is your goal, then this book probably isn't for you. </P

><p class="para">The reason has
to do with our definition of <em class="emphasis">practical</EM
>. For
security measures to be effective, they need to be generally applicable.
Most users of commercial systems do not have access to the source
code, and many don't even have access to compilers for their systems.
Public domain sources for some replacement commands are unlikely
to have support for the special features different vendors add to
their systems. If we were to suggest changes, they might not be
applicable to every platform of interest. </P
><p class="para">There is
also a problem associated with managing wide-scale changes. Not
only may changes make the system more difficult to maintain, but
changes may be impossible to manage across dozens of architectures
in different locations and configurations. They also will make vendor
maintenance more difficult-how can vendors respond to bug reports
for software that they didn't provide?</P
><p class="para">Last of all,
we have seen many programs and suggested fixes posted on the Internet
that are incorrect or even dangerous. Many administrators of commercial
and academic systems do not have the necessary expertise to evaluate
the overall security impact of changes to their system's kernel,
architecture, or commands. If you routinely download and install
third-party patches and programs to improve your system's security,
your overall security may well be worse in the long term.</P
><p class="para">For all
of these reasons, our emphasis is on using tools provided with your
operating systems. Where there are exceptions to this rule, we will
explain our reasoning.</P
