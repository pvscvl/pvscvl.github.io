><p class="para">In today's world of international networks and electronic
commerce, every computer system is a potential target. Rarely does
a month go by without news of some major network or organization
having its computers penetrated by unknown computer criminals. Although
some computer &quot;hackers&quot; (see the sidebar below)
have said that such intrusions are merely teenage pranks or fun
and games, these intrusions have become more sinister in recent
years: computers have been rendered inoperable; records have been
surreptitiously altered; software has been replaced with secret
&quot;back doors&quot; in place; proprietary information
has been copied without authorization; and millions of passwords
have been captured from unsuspecting users.</P
><p class="para">Even if nothing is removed or altered, system administrators
must often spend hours or days reloading and reconfiguring a compromised
system to regain some level of confidence in the system's
integrity. There is no way to know the motives of an intruder and
the worst must be assumed. <em class="emphasis">People</EM
> <em class="emphasis">who
break into systems simply to &quot;look around&quot; do real damage, even
if they do not read confidential mail and do not delete any files.</EM
> If computer security was once the subject of fun and
games, those days have long since passed.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-528"></A
>Many different
kinds of people break into computer systems. Some people&nbsp;- perhaps
the most widely publicized&nbsp;- are the equivalent of reckless
teenagers out on electronic joy rides. Like youths who &quot;borrow&quot;
fast cars, their main goal isn't necessarily to do damage,
but to have what they consider to be a good time. Others are far
more dangerous: some people who compromise system security are sociopaths,
joyriding around the networks bent on inflicting damage on unsuspecting
computer systems. Others see themselves at &quot;war&quot;
with rival hackers; woe to innocent users and systems who happen
to get in the way of cyberspace &quot;drive-by shootings!&quot;
Still others are out for valuable corporate information, which they
hope to resell for profit. There are also elements of organized
crime, spies and saboteurs motivated by both greed and politics,
terrorists, and single-minded anarchists using computers and networks.</P

><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">HACKER noun 1. A person who enjoys learning the details of
computer systems and how to stretch their capabilities&nbsp;- as
opposed to most users of computers, who prefer to learn only the
minimum amount necessary. 2. One who programs enthusiastically or
who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.</P

 The Hacker's Dictionary </P
><p class="para">There was a time when computer
security professionals argued over the term &quot;hacker.&quot;<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-536"></A

 Some thought that hackers were
excellent and somewhat compulsive computer programmers, like Richard
Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation. Others thought
that hackers were computer criminals, more like convicted felon
Mark Abene, a.k.a &quot;Phiber Optik.&quot; Complicating
this discussion was the fact that many computer security professionals
had formerly been hackers themselves&nbsp;- of both persuasions.
Some were anxious to get rid of the word, while others wished to
preserve it.</P
><p class="para">Today the confusion over the term hacker has largely been
resolved. While some computer professionals continue to call themselves
&quot;hackers,&quot; most don't. In the mind of
the public, the word &quot;hacker&quot; has been firmly
defined as a person exceptionally talented with computers who often
misuses that skill. Use of the term by members of the news media,
law enforcement, and the entertainment industry has only served
to reinforce this definition.</P
><p class="para">In some cases, we'll refer to people who break into
computers, and present a challenge for computer security, by a variety
of names: &quot;crackers,&quot; &quot;bad guys,&quot;
and occasionally &quot;hackers.&quot; However, in general,
we will try to avoid these labels and use more descriptive terms:
&quot;intruders,&quot; &quot;vandals,&quot; or simply,
&quot;criminals.&quot;</P
></DIV
><p class="para">The most dangerous computer criminals are usually insiders
(or former insiders), because they know many of the codes and security
measures that are already in place. Consider the case of a former
employee who is out for revenge. The employee probably knows which
computers to attack, which files will cripple the company the most
if deleted, what the defenses are, and where the backup tapes are
stored.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-545"></A
></P
><p class="para">Despite the risks, interest in computer networking and the
Internet has never been greater. The number of computers attached
to the Internet has approximately doubled every year for nearly
a decade. By all indications, this growth is likely to continue
for several years to come. With this increased interest in the Internet,
there has been growing interest in <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> as the
operating system of choice for Internet gateways, high-end research
machines, and advanced instructional platforms.</P

>Years ago, <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
was generally regarded as an operating system that was difficult
to secure. This reputation was partially unfounded. Although part
of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>'s poor reputation came from
design flaws and bugs, a bigger cause for blame rested with the
traditional use of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> and with the poor security
consciousness of its users. For its first 15 years, <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
was used primarily in academia, the computing research community,
the telephone company, and the computer industry itself. In most
of these environments, computer security was not a priority (until
perhaps recently). Users in these environments often configured
their systems with lax controls, and even developed philosophies
that viewed strong security as something to avoid. Because they
cater to this community (and hire from it), many <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
vendors have developed a culture that has been slow to incorporate
more practical security mechanisms into their products.[1]</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[1] James
Ellis at <span class="acronym">CERT</SPAN

<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

with the wide-spread availability of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

code, which allows for detailed inspection by potential attackers
for weaknesses. Buffer overflows or coding errors that would be
reported on other systems as merely causing crashes are reported
frequently on <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

break system security.</P

>Perhaps
the best known demonstration of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> vulnerability
to date occurred in November 1988. That was when Robert T. Morris
released his infamous &quot;Internet worm&quot; program,
which spread to thousands of computers in a matter of hours. That
event served as a major wake-up call for many <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
users and vendors. Since then, users, academics, and computer manufacturers
have usually worked together to try to improve the security of the
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> operating system. Many of the results of
those efforts are described in this book.</P
><p class="para">But despite the increasing awareness and the improvements
in defenses, the typical <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> system is still
exposed to many dangers. The purpose of this book is to give readers
a fundamental understanding of the principles of computer security
and to show how they apply to the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> operating
system. We hope to show you practical techniques and tools for making
your system as secure as possible, especially if it is running some
version of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>. Whether you are a user or administrator,
we hope that you will find value in these pages.</P
><div class="sect1"><h2 class="sect1"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-1-SECT-1">1.1 What Is Computer Security?</A

><p class="para">Terms like <i class="firstterm">security</I
>, <i class="firstterm">protection</I
>,
and <i class="firstterm">privacy</I
> often have more than one meaning.
Even professionals who work in information security do not agree
on exactly what these terms mean. The focus of this book is not
formal definitions and theoretical models so much as practical,
useful information. Therefore, we'll use an operational
definition of security and go from there.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-588"></A
>Computer Security:
&quot;A computer is secure if you can depend on it and its software
to behave as you expect.&quot;</P
><p class="para">If you expect the data entered into your machine today to
be there in a few weeks, and to remain unread by anyone who is not
supposed to read it, then the machine is secure. This concept is
often called <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-592"></A
>
trust: you trust the system
to preserve and protect your data.</P
><p class="para">By this definition, <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-595"></A
>
natural
disasters and <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-597"></A
>
buggy software are as much
threats to security as unauthorized users. This belief is obviously
true from a practical standpoint. Whether your data is erased by
a vengeful employee, a random virus, an unexpected bug, or a lightning
strike&nbsp;- the data is still gone.</P
><p class="para">Our practical definition might also imply to some that security
is concerned with issues of testing your software and hardware,
and with preventing user mistakes. However, we don't intend
our definition to be that inclusive. That's why the word
&quot;practical&quot; is in the title of this book&nbsp;- and
why we won't try to be more specific about defining what
&quot;security&quot; is, exactly. A formal definition wouldn't
necessarily help you any more than our working definition, and would
require detailed explanations of risk assessment, asset valuation,
policy formation, and a number of other topics beyond what we are
able to present here.</P
><p class="para">On the other hand, knowing something about these concepts
is important in the long run. If you don't know what you're
protecting, why you're protecting it, and what you are
protecting it from, your task will be rather difficult! Furthermore,
you need to understand how to establish and apply uniform security
policies. Much of that is beyond the scope of what we hope to present
here; thus, we'll discuss a few of these topics in <a class="xref" href="ch02_01.htm" title="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2, <cite class="chapter">Policies and Guidelines</CITE
></A
>, 
Policies and Guidelines. We'll also recommend that you examine some
of the references available. Several good introductory texts in
this area, including Computer Security Basics (Russell and Gangemi),
Computer Crime: A Crimefighter's Handbook (Seger, VonStorch,
and Icove), and Control and Security of Computer Information Systems
(Fites, Kratz, and Brebner) are listed in <a class="xref" href="appd_01.htm" title="Paper Sources">Appendix D, <cite class="appendix">Paper Sources</CITE
></A
>.
Other texts, university courses, and professional organizations
can provide you with more background. Security isn't a
set of tricks, but an ongoing area of specialization.</P
><p class="para">This book emphasizes techniques to help keep your system safe
from other people&nbsp;- including both insiders and outsiders,
those bent on destruction, and those who are simply ignorant or
untrained. The text does not detail every specific security-related
feature that is available only on certain versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
from specific manufacturers: companies that take the time to develop
such software usually deliver it with sufficient documentation.</P
><p class="para">Throughout this book, we will be presenting mechanisms and
methods of using them. To decide which mechanisms are right for
you, take a look at <a class="xref" href="ch02_01.htm" title="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2</A
>. Remember, each site must develop
its own overall security policies, and those policies will determine
which mechanisms are appropriate to use. End users should also read
<a class="xref" href="ch02_01.htm" title="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2</A
>&nbsp;- users should be aware of policy
considerations, too.</P

><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-611"></A
>For
example, if your local policy is that all users can build and install
programs that can be accessed by other users, then you may wish
to set the file permissions on <i class="filename">/usr/local/bin</I
>
to be mode 1777, which allows users to add their own files but does
not generally allow them to delete files placed there by other users.
If you don't wish to take the risk of allowing users to
install publicly accessible programs that might contain Trojan horses
or trap doors,[2]
a more appropriate file permissions setting for /usr/local/bin
might be 755.[3]</P

rogue user who installs a program called <i class="filename">ls </I
