>Physically protecting a computer presents
many of the same problems that arise when protecting typewriters,
jewelry, and file cabinets. Like a typewriter, an office computer
is something that many people inside the office need to access on
an ongoing basis. Like jewelry, computers are very valuable, and
very easy for a thief to sell. But the real danger in having a computer
stolen isn't the loss of the system's hardware
but the value of the loss of the data that was stored on the computer's
disks. As with legal files and financial records, if you don't
have a backup&nbsp;- or if the backup is stolen with the computer&nbsp;- the
data you have lost may well be irreplaceable. Even if you do have
a backup, you will still need to spend valuable time setting up
a replacement system. Finally, there is always the chance that stolen
information itself, or even the mere fact that information was stolen,
will be used against you.</P
><p class="para">Your computers are among
the most expensive possessions in your home or office; they are
also the pieces of equipment that you can least afford to lose.[1]</P

>To
make matters worse, computers and computer media are by far the
most temperamental objects in today's home or office. Few
people worry that their television sets will be damaged if they're
turned on during a lightning storm, but a computer's power
supply can be blown out simply by leaving the machine plugged into
the wall if lightning strikes nearby. Even if the power surge doesn't
destroy the information on your hard disk, it still may make the
information inaccessible until the computer system is repaired.</P
><p class="para">Power surges don't come only during storms:
one of the authors once had a workstation ruined because a vacuum
cleaner was plugged into the same outlet as the running workstation:
when the vacuum was switched on, the power surge fatally shorted
out the workstation's power supply. Because of the age
of the computer involved, it proved to be cheaper to throw out the
machine and lose the data, rather than attempt to salvage the hardware
and information stored on the machine's disk. That was
an expensive form of spring cleaning!</P
><p class="para">There are several
measures that you can take to protect your computer system against
physical threats. Many of them will simultaneously protect the system
from dangers posed by nature, outsiders, and inside saboteurs.</P

Halon fire extinguishers were exceedingly
popular for large corporate computer rooms. Halon is a chemical
that works by &quot;asphyxiating&quot; the fire's
chemical reaction. Unlike water, Halon does not conduct electricity
and leaves no residue, so it will not damage expensive computer
systems.</P
><p class="para">Unfortunately, Halon may also asphyxiate humans
in the area. For this reason, all automatic Halon systems have loud
alarms that sound before the Halon is discharged. Halon has another
problem as well: after it is released into the environment, it slowly
diffuses into the stratosphere, where it acts as a potent greenhouse
gas and contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer. Halon
is therefore being phased out and replaced with systems that are
based on carbon dioxide (CO2), which still asphyxiate fires (and
possibly humans), but which do not cause as much environmental degradation.</P
><p class="para">Here are some guidelines for fire control:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Make sure that you have a hand-held
fire extinguisher by the doorway of your computer room. Train your
computer operators in the proper use of the fire extinguisher. Repeat
the training at least once a year. One good way to do this is to
have your employees practice with extinguishers that need to be
recharged (usually once every year or two). However, don't
practice indoors!</P

that the computer's power is turned off before the water
starts to flow (although disks, tapes, and printouts out in the
open may suffer). Consequently, you should have your computer's
power automatically cut if the water sprinkler triggers.[2]
Be sure that the computer has completely dried out before the power
is restored. If your water has a very high mineral content, you
may find it necessary to have the computer's circuit boards
professionally cleaned before attempting to power up. Remember,
getting sensitive electronics wet is never a good idea.</P

system. In particular, a water system will continue to run long
after a CO2 system is exhausted, so it's more likely to
work against major fires. They also are less expensive to maintain,
and less hazardous to humans.</P
><p class="para">If you choose to have
a water-based sprinkler system installed, be sure it is a &quot;dry-pipe&quot;
system. This keeps water out of the pipes until an alarm is actually
triggered, rather than having the sprinkler heads pressurized all
the time. This may save your system from leaks or misfortune.[3]</P

>Local and wide area networks are
exceedingly vulnerable to vandalism. In many cases, a vandal can
disable an entire subnet of workstations by cutting a single wire
with a pair of wire cutters. Compared with Ethernet, fiber optic
cables are at the same time more vulnerable (because sometimes they
can be more easily damaged), more difficult to repair (because fiber
optics are difficult to splice), and more attractive targets (because
they often carry more information).</P
><p class="para">One simple method
for protecting a network cable is to run it through physically secure
locations. For example, Ethernet cable is often placed in cable
trays or suspended from ceilings with plastic loops. But Ethernet
can also be run through steel conduit between offices. Besides protecting
against vandalism, this practice protects against some forms of
network eavesdropping, and may help protect your cables in the event
of a small fire.</P
><p class="para">Some high-security installations use
double-walled, shielded conduit with a pressurized gas between the
layers. Pressure sensors on the conduit break off all traffic or
sound a warning bell if the pressure ever drops, as might occur
if someone breached the walls of the pipe. It important that you
physically protect your network cables. Placing the wire inside
an electrical conduit when it is first installed can literally save
thousands of dollars in repairs and hundreds of hours in downtime
later.</P
><p class="para">Many universities have networks that rely on
Ethernet or fiber optic cables strung through the basements. A single
frustrated student with a pair of wirecutters or a straight pin

><p class="para">We also have heard stories about fiber optic cable suffering
small fractures because someone stepped on it. A fracture of this
type is difficult to locate because there is no break in the coating.
Be very careful where you place your cables. Note that &quot;temporary&quot;
cable runs often turn into permanent or semi-permanent installations,
