is
the science and art of secret writing&nbsp;- keeping information
secret.[1]
When applied in a computing environment, cryptography can protect
data against unauthorized disclosure; it can authenticate the identity
of a user or program requesting service; and it can disclose unauthorized
tampering. In this chapter, we'll survey some of those
uses, and present a brief summary of encryption methods that are
often available in <span class="acronym">UNIX </SPAN
>systems.</P

></H2
><p class="para">Knowledge of cryptography can be traced back to ancient times.
It's not difficult to understand why: as soon as three
people had mastered the art of reading and writing, there was the
possibility that two of them would want to send letters to each
other that the third could not read.</P
><p class="para">In ancient Greece, the Spartan generals used a form of cryptography
so that the generals could exchange secret messages: the messages
were written on narrow ribbons of parchment that were wound spirally
around a cylindrical staff called a <i class="firstterm"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-6496"></A
>scytale</I
>.
After the ribbon was unwound, the writing on it could only be read
by a person who had a matching cylinder of exactly the same size.
This primitive system did a reasonably good job of protecting messages
from interception and from the prying eyes of the message courier
as well.</P
><p class="para">In modern times, cryptography's main role has been
in securing electronic communications. Soon after Samuel F. B. Morse
publicly demonstrated the telegraph in 1845, users of the telegraph
began worrying about the confidentiality of the messages that were
being transmitted. What would happen if somebody tapped the telegraph
line? What would prevent unscrupulous telegraph operators from keeping
a copy of the messages that they relayed and then divulging them
to others? The answer was to <i class="firstterm">encode </I
>the messages
with a secret code, so that nobody but the intended recipient could
decrypt them.</P
><p class="para">Cryptography became even more important with the invention
of radio, and its use in war. Without cryptography, messages transmitted
to or from the front lines could easily be intercepted by the enemy.</P

>As
long as there have been code makers, there have been code breakers.
Indeed, the two have been locked in a competition for centuries,
with each advance on one side being matched by counter-advances
on the other.</P
><p class="para">For people who use codes, the code-breaking efforts of <i class="firstterm">cryptanalysts</I
>
pose a danger that is potentially larger than the danger of not
using cryptography in the first place. Without cryptography, you
might be reluctant to send sensitive information through the mail,
across a telex, or by radio. But if you think that you have a secure
channel of communication, then you might use it to transmit secrets
that should not be widely revealed.</P
><p class="para">For this reason, cryptographers and organizations that use
cryptography routinely conduct their own code-breaking efforts to
make sure that their codes are resistant to attack. The findings
of these self-inflicted intrusions are not always pleasant. The
following brief story from a 1943 book on cryptography demonstrates
this point quite nicely:</P
><blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">[T]he importance of the part
played by cryptographers in military operations was demonstrated
to us realistically in the First World War. One instructive incident
occurred in September 1918, on the eve of the great offensive against
Saint-Mihiel. A student cryptographer, fresh from Washington, arrived
at United States Headquarters at the front. Promptly he threw the
General Staff into a state of alarm by decrypting with comparative
ease a secret radio message intercepted in the American sector.</P
><p class="para">The smashing of the German salient at Saint-Mihiel was one
of the most gigantic tasks undertaken by the American forces during
the war. For years that salient had stabbed into the Allied lines,
cutting important railways and communication lines. Its lines of
defense were thought to be virtually impregnable. But for several
months the Americans had been making secret preparations for attacking
it and wiping it out. The state was set, the minutest details of
strategy had been determined&nbsp;- when the young officer of
the United States Military Intelligence spread consternation through
our General Staff.</P
><p class="para">The dismay at Headquarters was not caused by any new information
about the strength of the enemy forces, but by the realization that
the Germans must know as much about our secret plans as we did ourselves&nbsp;- even
the exact hour set for the attack. The `intercepted'
message had been from our own base. German cryptographers were as
expert as any in the world, and what had been done by an American
student cryptographer could surely have been done by German specialists.</P
><p class="para">The revelation was even more bitter because the cipher the
young officer had broken, without any knowledge of the system, was
considered absolutely safe and had long been used for most important
and secret communications.[2]</P

digital computers
are, in some senses, the creations of cryptography. Some of the
first digital computers were built by the Allies to break messages
that had been encrypted by the Germans with electromechanical encrypting
machines. Code breaking is usually a much harder problem than code
making; after the Germans switched codes, the Allies often took
several months to discover the new coding systems. Nevertheless,
the codes were broken, and many historians say that World War II
was shortened by at least a year as a result.</P
><p class="para">Things really picked up when computers were turned to the
task of code making. Before computers, all of cryptography was limited
to two basic techniques: <i class="firstterm"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-6532"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-6534"></A
>transposition</I
>,
or rearranging the order of letters in a message (such as the Spartan's
scytale), and <i class="firstterm">substitution</I
>, or replacing
one letter with another one. The most sophisticated pre-computer
cipher used five or six transposition or substitution operations,
but rarely more.</P
><p class="para">With the coming of computers, ciphers could be built from
dozens, hundreds, or thousands of complex operations, and yet could
still encrypt and decrypt messages in a short amount of time. Computers
have also opened up the possibility of using complex algebraic operations
to encrypt messages. All of these advantages have had a profound
impact on cryptography.</P

><p class="para">In recent years, encryption has gone from being an arcane
science and the stuff of James Bond movies, to being the subject
of debate in several nations (but we'll focus on the case
in the U.S. in the next few paragraphs). In the U.S. that debate
is playing itself out on the front pages of newspapers such as <em class="emphasis">The
New York Times </EM
>and the<em class="emphasis"> San Jose Mercury News.</EM
></P
><p class="para">On one side of the debate are a large number of computer professionals,
civil libertarians, and perhaps a majority of the American public,
who are rightly concerned about their privacy and the secrecy of
their communications. These people want the right and the ability
to protect their data with the most powerful encryption systems
possible.</P
><p class="para">On the other side of the debate are the United States Government,
members of the nation's law enforcement and intelligence
communities, and (apparently) a small number of computer professionals,
who argue that the use of cryptography should be limited because
it can be used to hide illegal activities from authorized wiretaps
and electronic searches.</P

escrow</I

usual context is during debate over the ability of private citizens
to have access to strong cryptography. Many government officials
and prominent scientists advocate a form of escrowed encryption
as a good compromise between law enforcement needs and privacy concerns.
In such schemes, a copy of the decryption key for each user is escrowed
by one or more trusted parties, and is available if a warrant is
issued for it.</P
><p class="para">Whatever your feelings are on the matter of law enforcement
access to your decryption keys, <em class="emphasis">consider escrowing your
keys!</EM
> By this, we do not mean making your keys available
to the government. Rather, we mean placing a copy of your keys in
a secure location where they can be retrieved if you or someone
else needs them. You may pick a key so strong that you forget it
a year from now. Or, you might develop amnesia, get food poisoning
from a bad Twinkie, or get kidnapped by aliens to keep Elvis company.
If any of these calamities befall you, how are your coworkers or
family going to decrypt the vital records that you have encrypted?</P
><p class="para">We recommend that you deposit copies of your encryption keys
and passwords in safe locations, such as a safe or safety deposit
box. If you are uncomfortable about leaving the keys all in one
place, there are algorithms with which you can split a key into
several parts and deposit a part with each of several trusted parties.
With key-splitting schemes, one or two parts by themselves are not
enough to recreate the key, but a majority of them is enough to
recover the key. Consult a good book on cryptography for details.</P
