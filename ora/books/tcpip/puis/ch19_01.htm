the mid-1980s, Sun Microsystems developed a series of network protocols&nbsp;- Remote
Procedure Call (<span class="acronym">RPC</SPAN

Network Filesystem
(<span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
>)&nbsp;- that let a network of workstations
operate as if they were a single computer system. <span class="acronym">RPC</SPAN
>,
<span class="acronym">NIS</SPAN
>, and <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
> were largely
responsible for Sun's success as a computer manufacturer:
they made it possible for every computer user at an organization
to enjoy the power and freedom of an individual, dedicated computer
system, while reaping the benefits of using a system that was centrally
administered.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[1] Sun stopped
using the name Yellow Pages when the company discovered that the
name was a trademark of British Telecom in Great Britain. Nevertheless,
the commands continue to start with the letters &quot;yp.&quot;</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Sun was not the first company to develop
a network-based operating system, nor was Sun's approach
technically the most sophisticated. One of the most important features
that was missing was security: Sun's <span class="acronym">RPC</SPAN
>
and <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
> had virtually none, effectively throwing
open the resources of a computer system to the whims of the network's
users.</P
><p class="para">Despite this failing (or perhaps, because of
it), Sun's technology soon became the standard. Soon the
University of California at Berkeley developed an implementation
of <span class="acronym">RPC</SPAN
>, <span class="acronym">NIS</SPAN
>, and <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
>
that interoperated with Sun's. As <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
workstations became more popular, other companies, such as HP, Digital,
and even <span class="acronym">IBM</SPAN
> either licensed or adopted Berkeley's
software, licensed Sun's, or developed their own.</P
><p class="para">Over
time, Sun developed some fixes for the security problems in <span class="acronym">RPC</SPAN
>
and <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
>. Meanwhile, a number of other competing
and complementary systems&nbsp;- for example, Kerberos and <span class="acronym">DCE</SPAN
>&nbsp;- were
developed for solving many of the same problems. As a result, today's
system manager has a choice of many different systems for remote
procedure calls and configuration management, each with its own
trade-offs in terms of performance, ease of administration, and
security. This chapter describes the main systems available today
and makes a variety of observations on system security. For a full
discussion of <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
>, see <a class="xref" href="ch20_01.htm" title="NFS">Chapter 20, <cite class="chapter">NFS</CITE

>Any system
that is designed to provide services over a network needs to have
several fundamental capabilities:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A system for storing information on
a network server</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A mechanism for updating the stored information</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A mechanism for distributing the information to
other computers on the network</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">Early
systems performed these functions and little else. In a friendly
network environment, these are the only capabilities that are needed.</P
><p class="para">However, in an environment that is potentially hostile, or
when an organization's network is connected with an external
network that is not under that organization's control,
security becomes a concern. To provide some degree of security for
network services, the following additional capabilities are required:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><b class="emphasis.bold">Server authentication.</B
> Clients need
to have some way of verifying that the server they are communicating
with is a valid server.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><b class="emphasis.bold">Client authentication.</B
> Servers need to know that
the clients are in fact valid client machines.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><b class="emphasis.bold">User authentication.</B
> There needs to be a mechanism
for verifying that the user sitting in front of a client workstation
is in fact who the user claims to be.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><b class="emphasis.bold">Data integrity.</B
> A system is required for verifying
that the data received over the network has not been modified during
its transmission.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para"><b class="emphasis.bold">Data confidentiality.</B
> A system is required for protecting
information sent over the network from eavesdropping.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">These capabilities are independent from one another. A system
can provide for client authentication and user authentication, but
also require that the clients implicitly trust that the servers
on the network are, in fact, legitimate servers. A system can provide
for authentication of the users and the computers, but send all
information without encryption or digital signatures, making it
susceptible to modification or monitoring <em class="emphasis">en route</EM
>.</P
><p class="para">Obviously, the most secure network systems provide
all five network security capabilities.</P
