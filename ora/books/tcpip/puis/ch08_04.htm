you and arrange to have the password changed to something else.</P

an asterisk in the password field of the user's account.

a potential security problem. They may belong to someone who has

>We
have seen cases where systems had account entries in the password
file for users who had left the organization years before and had
never logged in since. In at least one case, we saw logins for users
that had not been active for more than three years, but the accounts
had ever-expanding mailboxes from system-wide mail and even some
off-site mailing lists! The problem was that the policy for removing
accounts was to leave them until someone told the admin to delete
them&nbsp;- something often overlooked or forgotten.</P
><p class="para">The easiest way to eliminate these historically dormant accounts
on your system is to create every user account with a fixed expiration
time. Users of active accounts should be required to renew their
accounts periodically. In this way, accounts that become dormant
will automatically expire if not renewed and they don't
become a liability.</P

of doing this. If nothing else, you can add an entry to the <em class="emphasis">crontab</EM

must couple this with periodic scans to determine which accounts
are inactive, and then remove them from the system (after archiving
them to offline storage, of course).</P
