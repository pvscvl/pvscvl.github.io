>Local and wide
area computer networks have changed the landscape of computing forever.
Almost gone are the days when each computer was separate and distinct.
Today, networks allow people across a room or across the globe to
exchange electronic messages, share resources such as printers and
disk drives, or even use each other's computers. Networks
have become such an indispensable part of so many people's
lives that one can hardly imagine using modern computers without
them.</P
><p class="para">But networks have also brought with them their
share of security problems, precisely because of their power to
let users easily share information and resources. Networks allow
people you have never met to reach out and touch you&nbsp;- and
erase all of your files in the process. They have enabled individuals
to launch sophisticated electronic attacks against major institutions
as well as desktop computers in home offices. Indeed, networks have
created almost as many risks as they have created opportunities.</P
><p class="para">The next six chapters of this book discuss <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
security issues arising from the deployment of computer networks.
In this chapter we describe local and wide area networks, and show
how they fit into the <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> security picture.</P

computer networks was the <span class="acronym">ARPANET</SPAN

in the early 1970s by universities and corporations working under
contract to the Department of Defense's Advanced Research
Projects Agency (<span class="acronym">ARPA</SPAN

The <span class="acronym">ARPANET</SPAN

and served as a backbone for many other regional and campus-wide
networks that sprang up in the 1980s. In the late 1980s, the <span class="acronym">ARPANET</SPAN

by the National Science Foundation. Funding for the <span class="acronym">NSFNET</SPAN

was cut in the early 1990s as commercial networks grew in number
and scope.</P
><p class="para">Today, the descendent of the <span class="acronym">ARPANET</SPAN

is known as the Internet. The Internet is an IP-based[2] network that encompasses hundreds
of thousands of computers and tens of millions of users throughout
the world. Similar to the phone system, the Internet is well connected.
Any one of those tens of millions of users can send you electronic
mail, exchange files with your <span class="acronym">FTP</SPAN

or try his hand at breaking into your system&nbsp;- if your system
is configured to allow them the access necessary to do so.</P

><p class="para">In the early
days of the <span class="acronym">ARPANET</SPAN
>, the network was primarily
used by a small group of research scientists, students, and administrative
personnel. Security problems were rare: if somebody on the network
was disruptive, tracking him down and having him disciplined was
a simple matter. In extreme cases, people could lose their network
privileges, or even their jobs (which produced the same result).
In many ways, the Internet was a large, private club.</P
><p class="para">These
days the Internet is not so exclusive. The Internet has grown so
large that you can almost never determine the identity of somebody
who is breaking into your system: attackers may appear to be coming
from a university in upstate New York, but the real story can be
quite different. Attackers based in the Netherlands could have broken
into a system in Australia, connected through the Australian system
to a system in South Africa, and finally connected through the South
African system to a New York university. The attackers could then
use the New York account as a base of operations to launch attacks
against other sites, with little chance of being traced back to
their own site. This site hopping is known as <i class="firstterm"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-19952"></A

or <i class="firstterm">connection laundering</I

><p class="para">Even
if you are persistent and discover the true identity of your attacker,
you may have no course of action: the attacks may be coming from
a country that does not recognize breaking into computers as a crime.
Or, the attacks may be coming from an agent of a foreign government,
as part of a plan to develop so-called &quot;information warfare&quot;
capabilities.[3]
There is also a suspected component of activity by organized crime,
and by some multinational corporations. In each of these cases,
there may be considerable resources arrayed against any attempt
to identify and prosecute the perpetrators.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[3] Some authorities speculate (in private)
that as many as a third of break-ins to major corporate and government
computers in the U.S. may be the result of &quot;probe&quot;

from and contributed to the popularity of networking. Berkeley's
