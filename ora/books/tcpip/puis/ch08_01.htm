Many programs that have shell escapes do not document this feature;
several popular games fall into this category. If a program that
can be run by a &quot;restricted&quot; account has the ability
to run subprograms, then the account may not be restricted at all.
For example, if the restricted account can use <em class="emphasis">man</EM

can use <em class="emphasis">man</EM

a shell, and then run programs on the system.</P
><p class="para">For instance, in our above example, all of the commands linked
into the restricted bin will spawn a subshell when presented with
the appropriate input. Thus, although the account appears to be
restricted, it will actually only slow down users who don't

>Another
way to restrict some users on your system is to put them into a
restricted filesystem. You can construct an environment where they
have limited access to commands and files, but can still have access
to a regular shell (or a restricted shell if you prefer). The way
to do this is with the <em class="emphasis">chroot </EM

system call. <em class="emphasis">chroot </EM

has a feature to do this change automatically. If the shell field
(field 7) for a user in the <em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</EM
> file
is a &quot;*&quot; symbol, then the login program
will make a <em class="emphasis">chroot </EM
>() call on the
home directory field (field 6) listed in the entry. It will then
reexecute the login program&nbsp;- only this time, it will be
the <i class="filename">login</I
> program in the reduced filesystem,
and will be using the new <i class="filename">passwd </I
>file found
there (one that has a real shell listed, we would expect). If you
do not have this feature in your version of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

you can easily write a small program to do so (it will need to be
<span class="acronym">SUID</SPAN
> <em class="emphasis">root</EM

>() call to function), and place the program's
pathname in the shell field instead of one of the shells.</P
><p class="para">The restricted filesystem so named must have all the necessary
files and commands for the login program to run and to execute programs
(including shared libraries). Thus, the reduced filesystem needs

do not need to contain all of the files and programs in the standard
directories. Instead, you can copy or link only those files necessary
for the user.[2]
Remember to avoid symbolic
links reaching out of the restricted area, because the associated
directories will not be visible. Using loopback mounts of the filesystem
in read-only mode is one good way to populate these limited filesystems
as it also protects the files from modification. <a class="xref" href="ch01_03.htm" title="Versions of UNIX">Figure 1.1</A

group
account is an account that is used by more than one person. Group
accounts are often created to allow a group of people to work on
the same project without requiring that an account be built for
each person. Other times, group accounts are created when several
different people have to use the same computer for a short period
of time. In many introductory computer courses, for example, there
is a group account created for the course; different students store
their files in different subdirectories or on floppy disks.</P
><p class="para">Group accounts are always a bad idea, because they eliminate
accountability. If you discover that an account shared by 50 people
has been used to break into computers across the United States,
tracking down the individual responsible will be nearly impossible.
Furthermore, a person is far more likely to disclose the password
for a group account than he is to release the password for an account
to which he alone has access. An account that is officially used
by 50 people may in fact be used by 150; you have no way of knowing.</P
><p class="para">Instead of creating group accounts, create an account for
each person in the group. If the individuals are all working on
the same project, create a new <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

make every user who is affiliated with the project part of the group.
