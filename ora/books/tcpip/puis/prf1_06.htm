><p class="para">We have many people
to thank for their help on the original book and on this very substantial
revision of that original book.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-PREFACE-SECT-6.1">First Edition</A
></H3
><p class="para">The first edition of this
book originally began as a suggestion by Victor Oppen-heimer, Deborah
Russell, and Tim O'Reilly at O'Reilly &amp; Associates. </P
><p class="para">Our
heartfelt thanks to those people who reviewed the manuscript of
the first edition in depth: Matt Bishop (UC Davis), Bill Cheswick,
Andrew Odlyzko, and Jim Reeds (AT&amp;T Bell Labs) (thanks also
to Andrew and to Brian LaMacchia for criticizing the section on
network security in an earlier draft as well), Paul Clark (Trusted
Information Systems), Tom Christiansen (Convex Computer Corporation),
Brian Kantor (UC San Diego), Laurie Sefton (Apple), Daniel Trinkle
(Purdue's Department of Computer Sciences), Beverly Ulbrich (Sun
Microsystems), and Tim O'Reilly and Jerry Peek (O'Reilly &amp; Associates).
Thanks also to Chuck McManis and Hal Stern (Sun Microsystems), who
reviewed the chapters on <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
> and <span class="acronym">NIS</SPAN
>.
We are grateful for the comments by Assistant U.S. Attorney William
Cook and by Mike Godwin (Electronic Frontier Foundation) who both
reviewed the chapter on the law. Fnz Jntfgnss (Purdue) provided
very helpful feedback on the chapter on encryption-gunaxf! Steve
Bellovin (AT&amp;T), Cliff Stoll (Smithsonian), Bill Cook, and Dan
Farmer (<span class="acronym">CERT</SPAN
>) all provided moral support and
helpful comments. Thanks to Jan Wortelboer, Mike Sullivan, John Kinyon,
Nelson Fernandez, Mark Eichin, Belden Menkus, and Mark Hanson for
finding so many typos! Thanks as well to Barry Z. Shein (Software
Tool and Die) for being such an icon and <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> historian.
Steven Wadlow provided the pointer to Lazlo Hollyfeld. The quotations
from Dennis Ritchie are from an interview with Simson Garfinkel
that occurred during the summer of 1990.</P
><p class="para">Many people
at O'Reilly &amp; Associates helped with the production of the first
edition of the book. Debby Russell edited the book. Rosanne Wagger
and Kismet McDonough did the copyediting and production. Chris Reilley
developed the figures. Edie Freedman designed the cover and the
interior design. Ellie Cutler produced the index.</P
><p class="para">Special
thanks to Kathy Heaphy, Gene Spafford's long-suffering and supportive
wife, and to Georgia Conarroe, his secretary at Purdue University's
Department of Computer Science, for their support while we wrote
the first edition. </P

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="PUIS-CHP-PREFACE-SECT-6.2">Second Edition</A
></H3
><p class="para">We are grateful to everyone
who helped us develop the second edition of this book. The book,
and the amount of work required to complete it, ended up being much larger
than we originally envisioned. We started the rewrite of this book
in January 1995; we finished it in March 1996, many months later
than we had intended.</P
><p class="para">Our thanks to the people at Purdue
University in the Computer Sciences Department and the <span class="acronym">COAST</SPAN
> Laboratory
who read and reviewed early drafts of this book: Mark Crosbie, Bryn
Dole, Adam Hammer, Ivan Krsul, Steve Lodin, Dan Trinkle, and Keith
A. Watson; Sam Wagstaff also commented on individual chapters.</P
><p class="para">Thanks to our technical reviewers: Fred Blonder (<span class="acronym">NASA</SPAN
>),
Brent Chapman (Great Circle Associates), Michele Crabb (<span class="acronym">NASA</SPAN
>),
James Ellis (<span class="acronym">CERT/CC</SPAN
>), Dan Farmer (Sun), Eric
Halil (<span class="acronym">AUSCERT</SPAN
>), Doug Hosking (Systems Solutions
Group), Tom Longstaff (<span class="acronym">CERT/CC</SPAN
>), Danny Smith
(<span class="acronym">AUSCERT</SPAN
>), Jan Wortelboer (University of Amsterdam), David
Waitzman (<span class="acronym">BBN</SPAN

We would also like to thank our product-specific reviewers, who
made a careful reading of the text to identify problems and add content
applicable to particular <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> versions or products.
They are C.S. Lin (HP), Carolyn Godfrey (HP), Casper Dik (Sun),
Andreas Siegert (<span class="acronym">IBM/AIX</SPAN
>), and Grant Taylor (Linux),</P
><p class="para">Several people reviewed particular chapters. Peter Salus reviewed
the introductory chapter; Ed Ravin (<span class="acronym">NASA</SPAN
> Goddard
Institute for Space Studies) reviewed the <span class="acronym">UUCP</SPAN
> chapter; Adam
Stein and Matthew Howard (Cisco) reviewed the networking chapters;
Lincoln Stein (<span class="acronym">MIT</SPAN
> Whitehead Institute) reviewed
the World Wide Web chapter. Wietse Venema reviewed the chapter on

><p class="para">Æleen Frisch, author of Essential System Administration
(O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 1995) kindly allowed us to excerpt the
section on access control lists from her book.</P
><p class="para">Thanks
to the many people from O'Reilly &amp; Associates who turned our
manuscript into a finished product. Debby Russell did another command
performance in editing this book and coordinating the review process.
Mike Sierra and Norman Walsh provided invaluable assistance in moving
Practical UNIX Security 's original troff files into FrameMaker format
and in managing an increasingly large and complex set of Frame and 
<span class="acronym">SGML</SPAN
> tools. Nicole Gipson Arigo did a wonderful
job as production manager for this job. Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary
assisted with the production process and managed the work of contractors. Kismet
McDonough-Chan performed a quality assurance review, and Cory Willing
proofread the manuscript. Nancy Priest created our interior design.
Chris Reilley developed the new figures. Edie Freedman redesigned
the cover. And Seth Maislin gave us a wonderfully usable index.</P
><p class="para">Thanks to Gene's wife Kathy and daughter Elizabeth for tolerating
continuing mentions of &quot;The Book&quot; and for many nights and weekends
spent editing. Kathy also helped with the proofreading.</P
><p class="para">Between
the first and second editions of this book, Simson was married to
Elisabeth C. Rosenberg. Special thanks are due to her for understanding
the amount of time that this project has taken.</P
