the threat is called, how it enters your system, or what the motives
of the person(s) who wrote it may be, the potential for damage is
your main concern. Any of these problems can result in downtime
and lost or damaged resources. Understanding the nature of a threat
is insufficient to prevent it from occurring.</P
><p class="para">At the
same time, remember that you do not need many special precautions
or special software to protect against programmed threats. The same
simple, effective measures you would take to protect your system
against unauthorized entry or malicious damage from insiders will
also protect your system against these other threats.</P
