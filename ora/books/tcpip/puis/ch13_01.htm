>Consider
a few recent incidents that made the news:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Nick Leeson, an investment trader
at the Barings Bank office in Singapore, and Toshihide Iguchi of
the Daiwa Bank office in New York City each made risky investments
and lost substantial amounts of their bank's funds. Rather
than admit to the losses, each of them altered computer records
and effectively gambled more money to recoup the losses. Eventually,
both were discovered after each bank lost more than one billion
dollars. As a result, Barings was forced into insolvency, and Daiwa
may not be allowed to operate in the United States in the future.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">In the U.S., personnel with the <span class="acronym">CIA</SPAN
>
and armed forces with high-security clearances (Aldrich Ames, Jonathon
Pollard, and Robert Walker) were discovered to have been passing
classified information to Russia and to Israel. Despite several
special controls for security, these individuals were able to commit
damaging acts of espionage.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">If
you examine these cases and the vast number of computer security
violations committed over the past few decades, you will find one
common characteristic: 100% of them were caused by people.
Break-ins were caused by people. Computer viruses were written by
people. Passwords were stolen by people. Without people, we wouldn't
have computer security problems! However, we continue to have people
involved with computers, so we need to be concerned with personnel
security.</P
><p class="para">&quot;Personnel security&quot; is
everything involving employees: hiring them, training them, monitoring
their behavior, and sometimes, handling their departure. Statistics
show that the most common perpetrators of significant computer crime
are those people who have legitimate access now, or who have recently
had access; some studies show that over 80% of incidents
are caused by these individuals. Thus, managing personnel with privileged
access is an important part of a good security plan.</P
><p class="para">People
are involved in computer security problems in two ways. Some people
unwittingly aid in the commission of security incidents by failing
to follow proper procedure, by forgetting security considerations,
and by not understanding what they are doing. Other people knowingly
violate controls and procedures to cause or aid an incident. As
we have noted earlier, the people who knowingly contribute to your
security problems are most often your own users (or recent users):
they are the ones who know the controls, and know what information
of value may be present.</P
><p class="para">You are likely to encounter
both kinds of individuals in the course of administering a <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
>
system. The controls and mechanisms involved in personnel security
are many and varied. Discussions of all of them could fill an entire
book, so we'll simply summarize some of the major considerations.</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17059"></A
>When you hire new employees, check their
backgrounds. You may have candidates fill out application forms,
but then what do you do? At the least, you should check all references
given by each applicant to determine his past record, including
reasons why he left those positions. Be certain to verify the dates
of employment, and check any gaps in the record. One story we heard
involved an applicant who had an eight-year gap in his record entitled
&quot;independent consulting.&quot; Further research revealed
that this &quot;consulting&quot; was being conducted from
inside a Federal prison cell&nbsp;- something the applicant had
failed to disclose, no doubt because it was the result of a conviction
for computer-based fraud.</P
><p class="para">You should also verify any
claims of educational achievement and certification: stories abound
of individuals who have claimed to have earned graduate degrees
from prestigious universities&nbsp;- universities that have no
records of those individuals ever completing a class. Other cases
involve degrees from &quot;universities&quot; that are little
more than a post office box.</P
><p class="para">Consider that an applicant
who lies to get a job with you is not establishing a good foundation
for future trust.</P
><p class="para">In some instances you may want to
make more intensive investigations of the character and background
of the candidates. You may want to:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Have an investigation agency do a
background check.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Get a criminal record check of the individual.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Check the applicant's credit record for
evidence of large personal debt and the inability to pay it. Discuss
problems, if you find them, with the applicant. People who are in
debt should not be denied jobs: if they are, they will never be
able to regain solvency. At the same time, employees who are under
financial strain may be more likely to act improperly.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Conduct a <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17073"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17075"></A
>
polygraph examination of the applicant (if legal).</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Ask the applicant to obtain bonding for his position.</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">In general, we don't recommend these steps for hiring
every employee. However, you should conduct extra checks of any
employee who will be in a position of trust or privileged access&nbsp;- including
maintenance and cleaning personnel.</P
><p class="para">We also suggest
that you inform the applicant that you are performing these checks,
and obtain his or her consent. This courtesy will make the checks
easier to perform and will put the applicant on notice that you
are serious about your precautions.</P
