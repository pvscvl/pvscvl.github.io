><p class="para">Of course, you won't simply say, <span class="quote">"I want to create four
subdomains."</SPAN
> Deciding how many child domains to implement is
really choosing the organizational affiliation of your subdomains. For
example, if your company has four branch offices, you might decide to
create four subdomains, each of which corresponds to a branch
office.</P
><p class="para">Should you create subdomains for each site, for each division,
or even for each department? You have a lot of latitude in your choice
because of <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
>'s scalability. You can create a few
large subdomains or many small subdomains. There are trade-offs
whichever you choose, though.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9350"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9353"></A
>Delegating to a few large subdomains isn't much work for the parent
domain, because there's not much delegation to keep track of. However,
you wind up with larger subdomains, which require more memory and
faster name servers, and administration isn't as distributed. If you
implement site-level subdomains, for example, you may force autonomous
or unrelated groups at a site to share a single name space and a
single point of administration.</P
><p class="para">Delegating to many smaller subdomains can be a headache for the
administrator of the parent.  Keeping delegation data current involves
keeping track of which hosts run name servers and which zones they're
authoritative for.  The data change each time a subdomain adds a new
name server, or when the address of a name server for the subdomain
changes. If the subdomains are all administered by different people,
that means more administrators to train, more relationships for the
parent administrator to maintain, and more overhead for the
organization overall. On the other hand, the subdomains are smaller
and easier to manage, and the administration is more widely
distributed, allowing closer management of subdomain data.</P
><p class="para">Given the advantages and disadvantages of either alternative, it
may seem difficult to make a choice. Actually, though, there's
probably a natural division in your organization. Some companies
manage computers and networks at the site level; others have
decentralized, relatively autonomous workgroups that manage everything
themselves. Here are a few basic rules to help you find the right way
to carve up your name space:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Don't shoehorn your organization into a weird or uncomfortable
domain structure. Trying to fit 50 independent, unrelated
U.S. divisions into 4 regional subdomains may save you work (as the
administrator of the parent zone), but it won't help your
reputation. Decentralized, autonomous operations demand different
domains&nbsp;- that's the <i class="foreignphrase">raison d'être</I
>
of the Domain Name System.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">The structure of your domain should mirror the structure of your
organization, especially your organization's
<em class="emphasis">support</EM
> structure.  If departments run networks,
assign <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> addresses, and manage hosts, then
departments should manage the subdomains.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If you're not sure or can't agree about how the namespace should
be organized, try to come up with guidelines for when a group within
your organization can carve off their own subdomain (e.g., how many
hosts do you need to create a new subdomain, what level of support
must the group provide) and grow the namespace organically, only as
needed.</P
