An experienced domain administrator needs to know how to set the time
to live on his zone's data to his best advantage. The
<i class="firstterm"><span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
></I
> on a resource record,
remember, is the time in seconds any server can cache that record. So
if the <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> for a particular resource record is 3600
(seconds), and a server outside your domain caches that record, it
will have to remove the entry from its cache after an hour. If it
needs the same data after the hour is up, it'll have to query your
name servers again.</P
><p class="para">When we introduced <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>s, we emphasized that
your choice of a <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> would dictate how current
you'd keep copies of your data, at the cost of increased load on your
name servers. A low <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> would mean that name
servers outside your domain would have to get data from your name
servers often, and would therefore keep current. On the other hand,
your name servers would be peppered by their queries.</P
><p class="para">You don't <em class="emphasis">have</EM
> to choose a
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> once and for all, though. You can&nbsp;- and
experienced administrators do&nbsp;- change <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>s
periodically to suit your needs.</P
><p class="para">Suppose we know that one of our hosts is about to be moved to
another network.  This host is the <i class="systemitem.sitename">movie.edu</I
> film library. It houses a large
collection of files our site makes available to hosts on the
Internet. During normal operation, outside name servers cache the
address of our host according to the minimum <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> in
the <span class="acronym">SOA</SPAN
> record. (We set the <i class="systemitem.sitename">movie.edu</I
> <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> to be
one day in our sample files.) A name server caching the old address
record just before the change could have the wrong address for as long
as a day.  A loss of connectivity for a day is unacceptable,
though. What can we do to minimize the loss of connectivity? We can
lower the <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>, so that outside servers cache the
address record for a shorter period. By reducing the
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>, we force the outside servers to update their
data more frequently, which means that any changes we make when we
actually move the system will be propagated to the outside world
quickly. How long can we make the <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>?
Unfortunately, we can't use a <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> of zero, which
should mean <span class="quote">"don't cache this record at all."</SPAN
> Some older
<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> 4 name servers can't return records with a
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> of zero, instead returning null answers or
<span class="acronym">SERVFAIL</SPAN
> errors.  Small <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>s,
like 30 seconds, are okay, though. The easiest change is to lower the
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> in the <span class="acronym">SOA</SPAN
> record in the
<i class="filename">db.movie</I
> file. If you don't place an explicit
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> on resource records in the db files, the name
server applies this <i class="firstterm">minimum
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
></I
> from the <span class="acronym">SOA</SPAN
>
record to each resource record. If you lower the minimum
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> field, though, the new, lower
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> applies to all addresses, not just the address
of the host being moved. The drawback to this approach is that your
name server will be answering a lot more queries, since the querying
servers will cache <em class="emphasis">all</EM
> the data in your zone for
a shorter period. A better alternative is to put a different
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> only on the affected address record.</P
><p class="para">To add an explicit <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> on an individual
resource record, place it before the <span class="acronym">IN</SPAN
> in the
class field. The <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> value is in seconds. Here's an
example of an explicit <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> from
<i class="filename">db.movie</I
>:</P

><p class="para">If you're observant, you may have noticed a potential problem:
the explicit <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> on <i class="systemitem.sitename">cujo</I
>'s address is 3600 seconds, but the
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN

<span class="acronym">SOA</SPAN

<em class="emphasis">minimum</EM

precedence?</P
><p class="para">If <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> followed the <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
>
<span class="acronym">RFC</SPAN
>s, the <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> field in the
<span class="acronym">SOA</SPAN
> record would really define the minimum
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> value for all resource records in the
zone. Thus, you could only specify explicit <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>s
larger than this minimum. <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> name servers don't
work this way, though. In other words, in <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
>,
<span class="quote">"minimum"</SPAN
> is not really minimum. Instead,
<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> implements the minimum <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>
field in the <span class="acronym">SOA</SPAN
> record as a <span class="quote">"default"</SPAN
>
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>. If there is no <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> on a
record, the minimum applies. If there is a <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> on
the resource record, <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> allows it even if it is
smaller than the minimum. That one record is sent out in responses
with the smaller <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>, while all other records are
sent out with the <span class="quote">"minimum"</SPAN
> <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> from
the <span class="acronym">SOA</SPAN
> record.</P
><p class="para">You should also know that when giving out answers, a slave
supplies the same <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> a primary does&nbsp;- that is,
if a primary gives out a <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> of 86400 for a
particular record, a slave will, too. The slave doesn't decrement the
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> according to how long it has been since it
loaded the zone. So, if the <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> of a single
resource record is set smaller than the <span class="acronym">SOA</SPAN
>
minimum, both the primary and slave name servers give out the resource
record with the same, smaller <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>. If the slave
name server has reached the expiration time for the zone, it expires
the whole zone. It will never expire an individual resource record
within a zone.</P
><p class="para">So <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> does allow you to put a small
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> on an individual resource record if you know
that the data is going to change shortly. Thus, any server caching
that data only caches it for a brief time. Unfortunately, while
<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> makes tagging records with a small
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> possible, most domain administrators don't
spend the time to do it. When a host changes address, you often lose
connectivity to it for a while.</P
><p class="para">More often than not, the host having its address changed is not
one of the main hubs on the site, so the outage impacts few people. If
one of the mail hubs or a major <kbd class="command">ftp</KBD
>
repository&nbsp;- like the film library&nbsp;- is moving, though, a
day's loss of connectivity may be unacceptable. In cases like this,
the domain administrator should plan ahead and reduce the
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> on the data to be changed.</P
><p class="para">Remember that the <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> on the affected data
will need to be lowered <em class="emphasis">before</EM
> the change takes
place. Reducing the <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> on a workstation's address
record and changing the workstation's address simultaneously may do
you little or no good; the address record may have been cached minutes
before you made the change, and may linger until the old
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> times out. <em class="emphasis">And</EM
> be sure to
factor in the time it'll take your slaves to load from your
primary. For example, if your minimum <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
> is 12
hours, and your refresh interval is 3 hours, be sure to lower the
<span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>s at least 15 hours ahead of time, so that by
the time you move the host, all the long <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
>
records will have timed out.  Of course, if all of your slaves are
<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> 8 servers that use <span class="acronym">NOTIFY</SPAN
>,
the slaves shouldn't take the full refresh interval to synch
up.</P

><p class="para">Suppose we've decided we want the slaves to pick up new
information every hour instead of every three hours.  We change the
refresh value to 3600 in each of the db files (or with the
<i class="option">-o</I
> option to <kbd class="command">h2n</KBD
>).  Since the
retry is related to refresh, we should probably reduce retry,
too&nbsp;- to every 15 minutes or so. Typically, the retry is less than
the refresh, but that's not required.[10] Although lowering the refresh value will speed up the
distribution of data, it will also increase the load on the server
being loaded from since the slaves will check more often. The added
load isn't much, though; each slave makes a single
<span class="acronym">SOA</SPAN
> query during each zone's refresh interval to
check its master's copy of the zone. So with two slave name servers,
changing the refresh time from three hours to one hour will only
generate four more queries (per zone) to the primary in any three-hour
span.</P

><p class="para">Some older versions of <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

answering queries during a zone load. As a result,
<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

refresh interval, your slaves may not check exactly as often as you

of zone loads and then wait 15 minutes before trying another batch.

refresh <em class="emphasis">more often</EM

number of seconds between one-half the refresh interval and the full
refresh interval to check serial numbers.</P
><p class="para">Expiration times on the order of a week are common&nbsp;- longer
if you frequently have problems reaching your updating source. The
expiration time should always be much larger than the retry and
refresh interval; if the expire time is smaller than the refresh
interval, your slaves will expire their data before trying to load new
data.  <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

time less than refresh plus retry, less than twice retry, less than
seven days or greater than six months.  Choosing an expire time that
meets all <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

situations.</P
><p class="para">If your data don't change much, you might consider raising the
minimum <span class="acronym">TTL</SPAN
