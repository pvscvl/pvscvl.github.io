>I'll bet you're drowsy too, after that looong chapter. Thankfully,
this next chapter discusses a topic that will probably be very
interesting to you system administrators and postmasters: how
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> impacts electronic mail. And even if it isn't
interesting to you, at least it's shorter than the last
chapter.</P
><p class="para">One of the advantages of the Domain Name System over host tables
is its support of advanced mail routing. When mailers only had
the <i class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I
> file (and its derivative,
<i class="filename">/etc/hosts</I
>) to work with, the best they could do
was to attempt delivery to a host's <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> address. If
that failed, they could either defer delivery of the message and try
again later, or bounce the message back to the sender.</P
><p class="para"><span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> offers a mechanism for specifying backup
hosts for mail delivery. The mechanism also allows hosts to assume
mail handling responsibilities for other hosts. This lets diskless
hosts that don't run mailers, for example, have mail addressed to them
processed by their server. Together, these features give
administrators much more flexibility in configuring electronic mail on
their network.</P

><span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> uses a single type of resource record to
implement enhanced mail routing, the
<i class="wordasword"><span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
></I
> record. Originally,
this functionality was split between two records, the
<i class="wordasword"><span class="acronym">MD</SPAN
></I
> (mail destination) and
<i class="wordasword"><span class="acronym">MF</SPAN
></I
> (mail forwarder)
records.  <span class="acronym">MD</SPAN
> specified the final destination to
which a message addressed to a given domain name should be
delivered. <span class="acronym">MF</SPAN
> specified a host that would forward
mail on to the eventual destination, should that destination be
unreachable.</P
><p class="para">Early experience with <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> on the Internet
showed that separating the functionality didn't work very well.  A
mailer needed both the <span class="acronym">MD</SPAN
> and <span class="acronym">MF</SPAN
>
records attached to a domain name (if both existed) to decide where to
send the mail&nbsp;- one or the other alone wouldn't do. But an
explicit lookup of one type or another (either <span class="acronym">MD</SPAN
>
or <span class="acronym">MF</SPAN
>) would cause a name server to cache just that
record type. So mailers either had to do two queries, one for
<span class="acronym">MD</SPAN
> and one for <span class="acronym">MF</SPAN
> data, or they
could no longer accept cached answers. This meant that the overhead of
running mail was higher than that of running other services, and was
eventually deemed unacceptable.</P
><p class="para">The two records were integrated into a single record type,
<span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
>, to solve this problem. Now a mailer just needed
all the <span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
> records for a particular domain name
destination to make a mail routing decision. Using cached
<span class="acronym">MX</SPAN

preference value. The preference value is an unsigned 16-bit number
(between 0 and 65535) that indicates the mail exchanger's
priority. For example, the <span class="acronym">MX</SPAN

><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">peets.mpk.ca.us.    IN    MX    10 relay.hp.com.</PRE

><p class="para">Taken together, the preference values of a host's mail
exchangers determine the order in which a mailer should use them. The
preference value itself isn't important, only its relationship to the
values of other mail exchangers: is it higher or lower than the values
of this host's other mail exchangers? Unless there are other records
involved:</P

></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">Mailers should attempt delivery to the mail exchangers with the
<em class="emphasis">lowest</EM

little counterintuitive at first&nbsp;- the <em class="emphasis">most</EM

preferred mail exchanger has the <em class="emphasis">lowest</EM
>
preference value.  But since the preference value is an unsigned
quantity, this lets you specify a <span class="quote">"best"</SPAN
> mail exchanger
at preference value 0.</P
><p class="para">If delivery to the most preferred mail exchanger(s) fails,
mailers should attempt delivery to less preferred mail exchangers
(those with <em class="emphasis">higher</EM
> preference values), in order
of increasing preference value. That is, mailers should try more
preferred mail exchangers before they try less preferred mail
exchangers.  More than one mail exchanger may share the same
preference value, too. This gives the mailer its choice of which to
send to first.[1] The mailer should try all the mail exchangers at a given
preference value before proceeding to the next higher value,
though.</P

><p class="para">What if a host doesn't have any <span class="acronym">MX</SPAN

Will a mailer simply not deliver mail to that host? Actually, you can
compile recent versions of<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4204"></A
>
<kbd class="command">sendmail</KBD
> to do just that. Most vendors, however,
have compiled their <kbd class="command">sendmail</KBD
>s to be more forgiving:
if no <span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
> records exist, they'll at least attempt
delivery to the host's address. <kbd class="command">sendmail</KBD
> version 8,
compiled <span class="quote">"out of the box,"</SPAN
> will try the address of a mail
destination without <span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
> records. Check your vendor's
documentation if you're not sure which variety your
<kbd class="command">sendmail</KBD
> is.</P
><p class="para">Even though nearly all mailers will deliver mail to a host with
just an address, and no <span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
> records, it's still a
good idea to have at least one <span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
> record for each
host. <kbd class="command">sendmail</KBD
> will request <span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
>
records for a host each time it needs to deliver mail.  If the host
doesn't have any <span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
> records, a name
server&nbsp;- usually one of your authoritative name
servers&nbsp;- still ends up answering that query. If you simply add an
<span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
> record for the host pointing to itself,
<kbd class="command">sendmail</KBD
> will have its first query answered, and
the mailer's local name server will cache the <span class="acronym">MX</SPAN
>
record for future use.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4222"></A
