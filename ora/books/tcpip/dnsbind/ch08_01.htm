are as few as you'll ever want to run. Depending on the size of your
network, you may need to run many more than just two servers.  It is
not uncommon to run from five to seven servers, with one of them
off-site. How many name servers are enough? You'll have to decide that
based on your network. Here are some guidelines to help out:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Have at least one name server available directly on each network
or subnet you have. This removes routers as a point of failure. Make
the most of any multihomed hosts you may have, since they're (by
definition) attached to more than one network.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">If you have a file server and some diskless nodes, run a name
server on the file server to serve this group of machines.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Run name servers near, but not necessarily on, large
time-sharing machines. The users and their processes probably generate
a lot of queries, and, as administrators, you will work harder to keep
a multiuser host up. But balance their needs against the risk of
running a name server&nbsp;- a security-critical server&nbsp;- on a
system that lots of people have access to.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Run one name server<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8350"></A
>
off-site. This makes your data available when your network isn't. You
might argue that it's useless to look up an address when you can't
reach the host. Then again, the off-site name server may be available
if your network is reachable, but your other name servers are down. If
you have a close relationship with an organization on the
Internet&nbsp;- say another university or a business partner&nbsp;- they
may consent to run a slave for you.</P

won't do you any good if the host is mired in some backwater subnet of
your network behind a slow, flaky serial line. Try to find a host
close to your link to the Internet (if you have one), or find a
well-connected Internet host to act as a slave for your zone. And on
your own network, try to run name servers near the hubs of your

tough time getting your vendor to support it. If you don't absolutely

get away with running your vendor's port of older

>Since you would undoubtedly prefer that hackers not commandeer your
name server to assist them in attacking your own hosts or other
networks across the Internet, it's important to run your name server
on a secure host. Don't run a name server on a big, multiuser system
whose users you can't trust. If you have certain computers that are
dedicated to hosting network services, but don't permit general
logins, those are good candidates for running name servers. If you
only have one or a few really secure hosts, consider running the
primary master name server on one of those, since its compromise would
be more significant than the compromise of the slaves.</P

Surfing the web can be name-server-intensive.  Sending electronic

>Once you've found that your name servers are overworked, what then?
First, it's a good idea to make sure that your name servers aren't
being bombarded with queries by a misbehaving program. To do that,
you'll need to find out where all the queries are coming from.</P
><p class="para">If you're running a <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

server, you can find out which resolvers and name servers are querying
your name server just by dumping the statistics. A modern server keeps
statistics on a host-by-host basis, which is really useful in tracking
down heavy users of your name server. For example, take these
statistics:</P
