>Despite the usefulness of the Domain Name System, there are
still some situations in which it doesn't pay to use it. There are
other name resolution mechanisms besides <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
>, some
of which may be standard with your operating system. Sometimes the
overhead involved in managing a domain and its name servers outweighs
the benefits. On the other hand, there are circumstances in which you
have no other choice but to set up and manage a domain. Here are some
guidelines to help you make that decision:</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-686">1.5.1 If you're connected to the Internet...</A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-689"></A
>...<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> is a must. Think of <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> as
the <i class="foreignphrase">lingua franca</I
> of the Internet:
nearly all of the Internet's network services use
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
>. That includes the World Wide Web, electronic
mail, remote terminal access, and file transfer.</P
><p class="para">On the other hand, this doesn't necessarily mean that you have
to set up and run a domain <em class="emphasis">by</EM
> yourself <em class="emphasis">for</EM
> yourself. If you've only
got a handful of hosts, you may be able to find an existing domain to
become part of (see <a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="Where Do I Start?">Chapter 3, <cite class="chapter">Where Do I Start?</CITE
></A
>). Or you may be able
to find someone else to run a domain for you. If you pay an Internet
service provider for your Internet connectivity, ask if they'll manage
a domain for you, too. Even if you aren't already a customer, there
are companies who will help out, for a price.</P
><p class="para">If you have a little more than a handful of hosts, or a lot
more, then you'll probably want your own domain. And if you want
direct control over your domain and your name servers, then you'll
want to manage it yourself. Buy this book and read on!</P

>...it's a good idea to set up a domain. <i class="systemitem.example">user@domain</I
>-style addressing has become
standard on the Internet. Once you've set up a domain, your
correspondents on the Internet will be able to send you mail using
these simpler addresses. You'll also be prepared if you decide later
to get a connection to the Internet.</P
><p class="para">It's a common misconception that you actually need to be
connected to the Internet to set up a domain and use <i class="systemitem.example">user@domain</I
> addresses. You'll need hosts on
the Internet to act as name servers for your domain, but they don't
have to be <em class="emphasis">your</EM
> hosts. You'd be surprised how many people are willing
to <span class="quote">"host"</SPAN
> your domain gratis: the Internet is still a
fairly neighborly place. (And even if you can't find anyone willing,
there are companies who will do it for you for cheap.)</P

don't mean just a single Ethernet of workstations using

you thought that was what we meant); we mean a fairly complex
<span class="quote">"network of networks."</SPAN

Appletalk nets and a handful of Apollo token rings.</P
><p class="para">If your internet is basically homogeneous and your hosts don't
need <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> (say you have a big
<span class="acronym">DEC</SPAN
>net or <span class="acronym">OSI</SPAN

you may be able to do without it. But if you've got a variety of
hosts, especially if some of those run some variety of
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

simplify the distribution of host information and rid you of any
kludgy host table distribution schemes you may have cooked up.</P

using Microsoft's Windows Internet Name Service
