GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS: REGISTERING INVERSE ADDRESSING (NAME MAPPING) WITH ARIN

The Internet uses a special domain to support gateway location and Internet
address to host mapping called In-ADDR.ARPA.  The intent of this domain is to
provide a guaranteed method to perform host address to host name mapping, and to
facilitate queries to locate all gateways on a particular network in the
Internet.  Whenever an application is used that requires user identification,
i.e., ftp, or remote login, the domain must be registered in the IN-ADDR.ARPA
zone or the application will be unable to determine the origin of the IP.

IN-ADDR domains are represented using the network number in reverse.

        EXAMPLE: The IN-ADDR domain for network 123.45.67.0 is represented as

                                67.45.123.IN-ADDR.ARPA.

        NOTE:  Please do not list your network number in reverse on your template.

Use the above template for registering new IN-ADDR entries, making changes to
existing IN-ADDR records, and removing inverse-address mapping from the ARIN
database and root servers.

The IN-ADDR template should be submitted via E-mail to ARIN at:

                hostmaster@arin.net

In order to ensure prompt and accurate processing of IN-ADDR requests, follow
precisely the instructions below.  Please do not modify the template nor remove
the version number.  IN-ADDR templates are automatically parsed.  Errors in a
template result in the template being returned for correction.

Please send only one template per message.  In the Subject of the message, use
the words: NEW IN-ADDR, MODIFY IN-ADDR, or REMOVE IN-ADDR, as appropriate.

Please do not send hardcopy registrations to ARIN.  If you do not have an E-mail
connection, you should arrange for your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to send
E-mail applications to ARIN on your behalf.

When you submit a template, you will receive an auto-reply from ARIN with a
ticket number.  The ticket number format is:

                ARIN -&lt;year&gt;&lt;month&gt;&lt;day&gt;.&lt;queue position&gt;.

Use the ticket number in the Subject of any message you send regarding a
registration action.  When the registration has been completed, you will be
notified via E-mail.

All ISPs receiving from ARIN /16 CIDR blocks (Class B) which are greater than or
equal to (&gt;= )256 Class C's) will be responsible for maintaining all
IN-ADDR.ARPA domain records for their respective customers.  The ISP is
responsible for the maintenance of IN-ADDR.ARPA domain records of all longer
prefixes that have been delegated out of that block.


DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING EACH IN-ADDR TEMPLATE FIELD


Section 0.   Registration Action Type

N) New (M) Modify (D) Delete:

(N)  New:
     For new IN-ADDR registration, place an N after the colon.

(M)  Modify:
     To modify/change an EXISTING record IN-ADDR registration, place an M after
     the colon. When &quot;M&quot; is selected, the current records will be replaced with
     the information listed in the template.  Please provide a complete list of
     name servers in the order in which they should appear on the record.

     If the modification involves first registering a person or name server(s)
     not entered in the database, the instructions for completing Sections 2,
     3, 4 and 5 apply.  Search the WHOIS database for more information if you
     are unsure of the current information for the technical POC or name
     server(s).

     The requested changes will be made if ARIN registry personnel determine
     that the modification request was issued by an authorized source. The
     issuing source may be a listed contact for the domain, others in the same
     organization, the current provider, or a new provider initiating network
     support.

(D)  Delete.
     To delete an existing IN-ADDR from your network record, place a D after
     the colon.  List the IN-ADDR server and IP number and it will be deleted.
     The host entry will still exist in the global host tables.


Section 1.  Network Record Information.

1a.  Network Name.
     Please supply the network name.

        NOTE:  The network name is not the domain name.

     To verify an existing Network Name, use the searchable WHOIS database.

     The Network Name is used as an identifier in Internet name and address
     tables.  To create a network name, supply a short name consisting of a
     combination of up to 12 numbers and letters for the network.  You may use
     a dash (-) as part of the Network Name, but no other special characters.
     Please do not use periods or underscores.

1b./1c.   Start/End of Network Block.

1b.  Start of Network Block.

     If the network record is for a single network, enter the IP address of
     the single network here.  Item 1c is then left blank.  If the record is
     a block of IP addresses, enter the IP address of the start of the
     network block.

1c.  End of Network Block.

     If the network record is a block of IP addresses, Item 1c will be the
     last IP address of the network block.

     If you received a block of IP addresses from your ISP, there may already
     be IN-ADDR servers on the parent block held by that provider.
     Please query your ISP before submitting an IN-ADDR request.


Section 2.  Name and Postal Address of Organization.

2a.  Name of Organization.

     The network is considered to be registered to an organization, even if
     the &quot;organization&quot; is an individual.  If you are an ISP submitting
     this request on behalf of your customer, please provide here the
     name and postal address of the organization that uses the IP address(es).

2b.  Postal Address of Organization.

     This is the physical address of the organization.  Place the city, state,
     and zip code together on the same line below the Street Address or Post
     Office Box.  Use a comma to separate the city and state.  Do not insert
     a period following the state abbreviation.  To change an address, please
     provide the new address information in this item, and flag the change in
     Section 6: Comments.

        EXAMPLE:

                   111 Town Center Drive
                   Herndon, VA 22070

     If the organization is located in a country other than the United States,
     please include the two-letter country code on the last line by itself.

     EXAMPLE:
               161 James Street
               Montreal, QC H2S 2C8
               CA

     For the country entry, please use the two-letter country code found at:

                URL:  [ftp://rs.arin.net/netinfo/iso3166-countrycodes]


     NOTE:  If you wish to make a change to an existing registered physical
            address of an organization, please note the change you want in
            Section 6: Comments.

Section 3.  Technical Contact

     The technical point of contact (POC) is the person responsible for
     the technical aspects of maintaining the network's name servers.
     The POC should be able to answer any utilization questions ARIN may have.

3a.  User Handle (if known)

     Each person in the ARIN database is assigned a user handle, which is a
     unique tag consisting of the user's initials and a serial number.  This
     tag is used in database records indicate a POC for a domain name, network,
     name server or other entity.  Each user should have only one handle.

     If the user handle is known, insert the handle in Item 3a and leave the
     rest of Section 3 blank.  If the user's handle is unknown or the user has
     never been registered, leave Item 3a blank.  The user's database record
     will be updated with any new information on the template.

3b.  Name (Last, First)
     Enter the name of the Technical Contact in the format:

                     Last Name, First Name.

     Separate first and last names by a comma.


3c.  Organization.

     Provide the name of the organization with which the Technical Contact
     is affiliated. Refer to the instructions for Item 2a.

3d.   Postal Address.

     Refer to the instructions for Item 2b.



Section 4.   Primary Name Server.

Networks are required to provide at least two independent servers for
translating address to name mapping for hosts in the domain.  The servers should
be in physically separate locations and on different networks, if possible.  The
servers should be active and responsive to domain name server (DNS) queries
prior to submission of this application.

ARIN requires that you provide complete information on your primary and
secondary servers in order to process your registration request. Incomplete
information in sections 4 and 5, or inactive servers will result in the return
of the registration request.

NOTE:  To change the name or the number of a registered name server, submit
       a separate IN-ADDR template requesting a modification of your IN-ADDR
       registration.  Do this by placing an M after the Modify command in
       Section 0:  Registration Action Type. New IN-ADDR registrations cannot
       be used to change the name or the number of a registered name server.

4a.  Primary Name Server Hostname.
     Please provide the fully-qualified name of the machine that is to be
     the name server.

        EXAMPLE:
                   Use &quot;machine.domainame.com&quot; not just &quot;machine&quot; or just
&quot;domainame.com&quot;
                   Many reverse-authentication programs will not search for the
nameserver if only the domain name is listed.

4b.  Primary Name Server Netaddress.

     It is suggested that the fourth octet of an IP address of a server
     should be neither 0 nor 255.  The remaining 254 numbers in the fourth
     octet of the IP address are valid.


Section 5.  Secondary Name Server(s)

5a./5b.  Secondary Name Server Hostname/Secondary Name Server Netaddress.

     Please refer to the instructions and examples in Items 4a./4b. above.

     Copy Section 5 as needed to include all Secondary Name Servers.
     Do not renumber or change the copied section.  A maximum of six domain
     name servers may be added to a network record.


Section 6.  Comments.

Please use Section 6 to provide ARIN with all comments and any additional
detailed updates relevant to your IN-ADDR registration not provided in Sections
0 through 5. Please provide a brief explanation for changing an organization
name or point of contact information.</PRE
