>One of the tools in your troubleshooting toolchest is the name
server's debugging output. As long as your name server has been
compiled with <span class="acronym">DEBUG</SPAN
> defined, you can get
query-by-query reports of its internal operation. The messages you get
are often quite cryptic; they were meant for someone who has the
source code to follow. We'll explain some of the debugging output in
this chapter. Our goal is to cover enough for you to follow what the
name server is doing; we aren't trying to supply an exhaustive
compilation of debugging messages.</P
><p class="para">As you read through the explanations here, think back to
material covered in earlier chapters. Seeing this information again,
in another context, should help you understand more fully how a name
server works.</P

>The amount of information the name server provides depends on the
debugging level. The lower the debugging level, the less information
you get.  Higher debugging levels give you more information, but they also
fill up your disk faster. After you've read a lot of debugging output,
you'll develop a feel for how much information you'll need to solve
any particular problem. Of course, if you can easily recreate the
problem, you can start at level 1 and increase the debugging level
until you have enough information. For the most basic
problem&nbsp;- why a name can't be looked up&nbsp;- level 1 will often
suffice, so you should start there.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-12902">12.1.1 What Information Is at Each Level?</A
></H3
><p class="para">Here is a list of the information that each debugging level will
give. The debugging information is cumulative; for example, level 2
includes all level 1's debugging information. The data are divided
into the following basic areas: starting up, updating the database,
processing queries, and maintaining zones. We won't cover updating the
name server's internal database&nbsp;- problems always occur
elsewhere. However, <em class="emphasis">what</EM
> the name server adds or deletes from its
internal database can be a problem, as you'll see in <a class="xref" href="ch13_01.htm" title="Troubleshooting DNS and BIND">Chapter 13, <cite class="chapter">Troubleshooting <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> and
<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
></CITE
></A
>.</P
><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term">Level 1</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">The information at this level is necessarily brief.  Name
servers can process <em class="emphasis">lots</EM
> of queries, which can create <em class="emphasis">lots</EM
> of
debugging output. Since the output is condensed, you can collect data
over long periods. Use this debugging level for basic startup
information and for watching query transactions. You'll see some
errors logged at this level, including syntax errors and
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> packet formatting errors. This level will also
show referrals.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Level 2</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Level 2 provides lots of useful stuff: it lists the
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> addresses of remote name servers that are used
during a lookup, along with their round trip time values; it calls out
bad responses; and it tags a response as to which type of query it is
answering, a <span class="acronym">SYSTEM</SPAN
> (sysquery) or a
<span class="acronym">USER</SPAN
> query. When you are tracking down a problem
with a secondary server loading a zone, this level shows you the zone
values&nbsp;- serial number, refresh time, retry time, expire time, and
time left&nbsp;- as the secondary checks if it is up-to-date with its
master.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Level 3</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Level 3 debugging becomes much more verbose because it generates
lots of messages about updating the name server database.  Make sure
you have enough disk space if you are going to collect debugging
output at level 3 or above. At level 3, you'll also see: duplicate
queries called out, system queries generated (sysquery), the names of
the remote name servers used during a lookup, and the number of
addresses found for each server.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Level 4</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Use level 4 debugging when you want to see the query and
response packets <em class="emphasis">received</EM
> by the name server.  This level also shows
the credibility level for cached data.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Level 5</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">There are a variety of messages at level 5, but none of them are
particularly useful for general debugging. This level includes some
error messages, for example, when a <kbd class="command">malloc()</KBD
> fails, and a message when
the name server gives up on a query.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Level 6</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Level 6 shows you the response sent to the original
query.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Level 7</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Level 7 shows you a few configuration and parsing
messages.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Level 8</DT

level.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Level 9</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">There is no significant debugging information at this
level.</P

><dt class="term">Level 10</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Use level 10 debugging when you want to see the query and
response packets <em class="emphasis">sent</EM
> by the name server. The format of these packets
is the same format used in level 4. You wouldn't use this level very
often, since you can see the name server response packet with
<kbd class="command">nslookup</KBD
>.</P
></DD
><dt class="term">Level 11</DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">There are only a couple of debugging messages at this level, and
they are in seldom-traversed code.</P
></DD
></DL
><p class="para">With <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> 8, you can configure the name
server to print out the debug level with the debug message.  Just turn
on the logging option <i class="option">print-severity</I

><p class="para">Keep in mind that this <em class="emphasis">is</EM

information&nbsp;- it was used by the authors of
<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

you might like. You can use it, too, to figure out why the name server
isn't doing what you think it should be doing, or just to learn how
the name server operates&nbsp;- but don't expect nicely designed,
carefully formatted output.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-12969"></A
