>Another relatively recent
development in networking that presents a challenge to <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> is the
dialup Internet connection. When the Internet was young, and <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
>
was born, there was no such thing as a dialup connection. With
the enormous explosion in the Internet's popularity, and the propagation
of Internet service providers who offer dialup Internet connectivity
to the masses, a whole new breed of problems with name service has
been introduced.</P
><p class="para">We'll separate dialup connections
into two categories: simple dialup, by which we mean a single computer
that connects to the Internet occasionally, when a user manually
initiates a connection, and dial-on-demand, which means one or more
computers that connect to the Internet automatically whenever they
generate traffic bound for the Internet. Often, the device that
makes this dial-on-demand connectivity possible is a small dialup
router with an analog modem or <span class="acronym">ISDN</SPAN
> interface, like an Ascend Pipeline
25.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-17352">15.5.1 Simple Dialup</A
></H3
><p class="para">The easiest way to deal
with<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17355"></A
>
simple
dialup is to configure your dialup computer's resolver to use a
name server provided by your Internet service provider (<span class="acronym">ISP</SPAN
>). Most
<span class="acronym">ISP</SPAN
>s run name servers for their subscribers' use. If you're not
sure whether your <span class="acronym">ISP</SPAN
> provides name servers for your use, or if
you don't know what their <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> addresses are, check their web site,
send them email, or give them a call.</P
><p class="para">Some operating systems,
like Windows 95 and <span class="acronym">NT</SPAN
>, will let you define a set of name servers
for a particular dialup provider. So, for example, you can configure
one set of name servers to use when you dial up Netcom, and another
to use when you dial up your office. Unfortunately, defining name
servers for your <span class="acronym">LAN</SPAN
> connection under Windows 95 currently overrides
all your precious dialup settings. See <a class="xref" href="ch06_01.htm" title="Configuring Hosts">Chapter 6, <cite class="chapter">Configuring Hosts</CITE
></A
>,
for details.</P
><p class="para">This configuration is usually adequate
for most casual dialup users. Name resolution will fail unless
the dialup connection is up, but that's not likely to be a problem,
since there's no use for Internet name service without Internet
connectivity. If you have special needs that aren't addressed by
this configuration, take a look at the recommendations in the dial-on-demand section.</P

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="AUTOID-17366">15.5.2 Dial-on-Demand</A
></H3
><p class="para">A more sophisticated dialup
solution is<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17369"></A
>
dial-on-demand.
Dial-on-demand Internet connections often use dedicated hardware,
like a small dialup router, to provide connectivity whenever it's
needed. If you initiate a connection to the Internet from the &quot;remote&quot;
end of a dial-on-demand router, bingo, it dials up another router on
the Internet and routes your packets across. If the connection is
idle for more than a specified amount of time, the router drops
the connection.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-17372"></A
>The challenge with <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> is to keep a local
name server from continuously bringing the demand dial connection up
and down like a yo-yo. This could be costly for you, since you sometimes
pay a premium for connection setup with technologies like <span class="acronym">ISDN</SPAN
>.</P
><p class="para">The most important strategy for minimizing this off-net traffic
is to configure your resolvers to use a minimal search list. Default
search lists with resolvers based on <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> 4.8.3 or earlier search
the ancestors of your local domain, which can cause unnecessary
remote traffic. For instance, say your local domain is <em class="emphasis">tinyoffice.majorcorp.com</EM
>,
and you have a dial-on-demand connection to Majorcorp's enterprise
network. On your older (pre-4.9) hosts, your default search list
is:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">tinyoffice.majorcorp.com
majorcorp.com</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">A user typing <em class="emphasis">telnet foo.tinyoffice.majorcorp.com</EM
> to
log in to the workstation next to him will inadvertently cause lookups
of:</P
><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">foo.tinyoffice.majorcorp.com.tinyoffice.majorcorp.com and
foo.tinyoffice.majorcorp.com.majorcorp.com</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">before the correct domain name, <em class="emphasis">foo.tinyoffice.majorcorp.com</EM
>,
is looked up. Since your local name server is probably authoritative
for <em class="emphasis">tinyoffice.majorcorp.com</EM
>, it can tell that
the first domain name, <em class="emphasis">foo.tinyoffice.majorcorp.com.tinyoffice.majorcorp.com</EM
>,
is bogus. (It ends in <em class="emphasis">com.tinyoffice.majorcorp.com</EM
>,
so it would require the existence of a <em class="emphasis">com</EM
> subdomain
of your local domain, and there isn't one.) But it can't tell about
the second domain name without talking to a <em class="emphasis">majorcorp.com</EM
> name
server first. If there isn't one locally, it'll have to bring up
that dial-on-demand connection.</P
><p class="para">The easiest way to prevent
these unnecessary queries is to trim the parent domain out of your
search list explicitly, using the <em class="emphasis">search</EM
> directive.
Or, if you can, upgrade your resolver to <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> 4.9 or later, which
will check the domain name as is first if it has at least <em class="emphasis">ndots</EM
> dots
in it, and which doesn't put any ancestor domains into the search
list by default.</P
><p class="para">If your name server continues to bring
up the link, try turning on query logging (with <em class="emphasis">options
query-log</EM
> on a 4.9 name server, or <em class="emphasis">ndc query</EM
> with
a <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> 4.9 or 8 name server, or by turning on debugging on an older
name server) and look for the domain names that bring up the link.
If many of them are in your parent zone, you might consider configuring
your local name server as a slave for your parent zone. At least
that way you'll only bring up the link at most once per refresh
interval to resolve names in your parent zone. The same logic could
be applied to nearly any zone your local name server queries often.</P
