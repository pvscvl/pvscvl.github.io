>It's a fact of life on a network that things go wrong. Hardware fails,
software has bugs, and people very occasionally make
mistakes. Sometimes this results in minor inconvenience, like having a
few users lose connections. Sometimes the results are catastrophic
and involve the loss of important data and valuable jobs.</P
><p class="para">Because the Domain Name System relies so heavily on the network,
it is vulnerable to network outages.  Thankfully, the design of
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN

networks: it allows for multiple, redundant name servers,
retransmission of queries, retrying zone transfers, and so on.</P
><p class="para">The Domain Name System doesn't protect itself from every
conceivable calamity, though. There are types of network
failure&nbsp;- some of them quite common&nbsp;- that
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN

small investment of time and money, you can minimize the threat of
these outages.</P

is effectively a black hole. After about 75 seconds of trying, the
resolver will just time out and return a null answer to the
application that called it. Only if the name server host has actually
started networking&nbsp;- but not yet started the name
server&nbsp;- will the resolver get an error: an

><p class="para">Overall, the single name server configuration does work if you
have name servers available on each net, but perhaps not as elegantly
as we might like. If the local name server hasn't come up when a host
on its network reboots, the <kbd class="command">route</KBD

fail.</P

primary network interface has been

through the name servers, querying them until one answers or the
75-plus second timeout is reached.</P
><p class="para">This is especially problematic during bootup. If none of the

without returning an <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN

><p class="para">Our recommendation, as primitive as it sounds, is to hardcode
the <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN

startup file, or to use an external file (many systems use<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9138"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9140"></A
>
<i class="filename">/etc/defaultrouter</I
>). This will ensure that your
host's networking will start correctly.</P
><p class="para">An alternative is to list just a single, reliable name server on
your host's local net in <i class="filename">resolv.conf</I
>. This will
allow you to use the name of the default router in the startup file,
as long as you make sure that the router's name appears in
<i class="filename">/etc/hosts</I
> (in case your reliable name server
isn't running when the host reboots).  Of course, if the host running
the reliable name server isn't running when your host reboots, all
bets are off. You won't fall back to <i class="filename">/etc/hosts</I
>,
because there won't be any networking running to return an error to
your host.</P
><p class="para">If your vendor's version of <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

configuration of the order in which services are queried, or will fall
back from <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN

<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN

In the former case, you can configure the resolver to check&nbsp;<i class="filename">/etc/hosts</I
> first, and then keep a
<span class="quote">"stub"</SPAN
> <i class="filename">/etc/hosts</I
> file on each host,
including the default router and the local host's name. In the latter
situation, just make sure such a <span class="quote">"stub"</SPAN
>
<i class="filename">/etc/hosts</I
> exists; no other configuration should
be necessary.</P
><p class="para">A last, promising prospect is to do away with setting the
default route manually by using<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9158"></A

<i class="firstterm"><span class="acronym">ICMP</SPAN
> Router Discovery
Messages</I

multicast messages to dynamically discover and advertise routers on a
network.  Sun includes an implementation of this protocol in recent
versions of Solaris as <i class="filename">/usr/sbin/in.rdisc</I

newer versions of Cisco's Internetwork Operating System
(<span class="acronym">IOS</SPAN

>The best solution to this problem is to run a name server on a host
with uninterruptible power. If you rarely experience extended power
loss, battery backup might be enough. If your outages are longer, and
name service is critical to you, you should consider an
uninterruptible power system (<span class="acronym">UPS</SPAN
>) with a generator
of some kind.</P
><p class="para">If you can't afford luxuries like these, you might just try to
track down the fastest booting host around and run a name server on
it.  Hosts with filesystem journaling should boot especially quickly,
since they don't need to <kbd class="command">fsck</KBD
>. Hosts with small
filesystems should boot quickly, too, since they don't have as much
filesystem to check.</P
><p class="para">Once you've located the right host, you'll need to make sure the
host's <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> address appears in the
<i class="filename">resolv.conf</I
> files of all the hosts that need
full-time name service. You'll probably want to list the backed-up
host last, since during normal operation, hosts should use the name
server closest to them. Then, after a power failure, your critical
applications will still have name service, albeit at a small sacrifice
in performance.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9187"></A
