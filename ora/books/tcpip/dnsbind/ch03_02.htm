>Choosing a domain name is more involved than it may sound, because it
entails both choosing a name <em class="emphasis">and</EM
> finding a
parent.  In other words, you need to find out where you fit in the
Internet domain name space, and decide what you'd like to call your
particular corner of that name space.</P
><p class="para">The first step in picking a domain name is finding where in the
existing domain name space you belong. It's easiest to start at the
top and work your way down: decide which top-level domain you belong
in, then which of that top-level domain's subdomains you fit
into.</P
><p class="para">Note that in order to find out what the Internet domain name
space looks like (beyond what we've already told you), you'll need
access to the Internet. You don't need access to a host that already
has Domain Name Service configured, but it would help a little. If you
don't have access to a host with <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> configured,
you'll have to <span class="quote">"borrow"</SPAN
> name service from other name
servers (as in our previous <i class="systemitem.sitename">ftp.isc.org</I
> example) to get you
going.</P

>If your organization is attached to the Internet outside of the United
States, you first need to decide whether you'd rather request a domain
under the generic top-level domains, like <i class="systemitem.sitename">com</I
> and <i class="systemitem.sitename">edu</I
>, or under your country's top-level
domain.  The generic top-level domains, even though some are used
largely <em class="emphasis">by</EM
> U.S. organizations, aren't exclusively
<em class="emphasis">for</EM
> U.S. organizations. If your company is a
multi- or transnational company, you may wish to join a generic
top-level domain, or if you'd simply prefer a generic top-level to
your country's top-level domain, you're welcome to ask to join one. If
you choose this route, skip to the section <a class="xref" href="#DNS3-CHP-GTLD" title="The generic top-level domains">Section 3.2.2.2, "The generic top-level domains</A
>&quot; later in this chapter.</P
><p class="para">If you opt for a<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2070"></A
>
subdomain under your country's top level, you
should check whether your country's top-level domain is registered,
and if it is, what kind of structure it has. Consult our list of the
current top-level domains (<a class="xref" href="appc_01.htm" title="Top-Level Domains">Appendix C, <cite class="appendix">Top-Level Domains</CITE
></A
>) if you're not
sure what the name of your country's top-level domain would be.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2075"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-2078"></A
>Some countries' top-level domains, like New Zealand's <i class="systemitem.sitename">nz</I
>, Australia's <i class="systemitem.sitename">au</I
>, and the United Kingdom's <i class="systemitem.sitename">uk</I
>, are divided organizationally into
second-level domains. The names of their second-level domains, like
<i class="systemitem.sitename">co</I
> or <i class="systemitem.sitename">com</I
> for commercial entities, reflect
organizational affiliation. Others, like France's <i class="systemitem.sitename">fr</I
> domain, and Canada's <i class="systemitem.sitename">ca</I
> domain, are divided into a multitude
of subdomains managed by individual universities and companies, like
the University of St. Etienne's domain, <i class="systemitem.sitename">univ-st-etienne.fr</I
> and Bell Northern
Research's <i class="systemitem.sitename">bnr.ca</I
>. You'll
have to use a tool like <kbd class="command">nslookup</KBD
> to grope around
and discover your top-level domain's structure if it isn't
well-known. (If you're uncomfortable with our rushing headlong into
<kbd class="command">nslookup</KBD
> without giving it a proper introduction,
you might skim <a class="xref" href="ch11_01.htm" title="nslookup">Chapter 11, <cite class="chapter">nslookup</CITE

>Once upon a time, when we wrote the first edition of this book,
the Internet's 32-bit address space was divided up into three main
classes of networks: class A, class B, and class C.  Class A networks
were networks in which the first octet (first eight bits) of the
<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> address identified the network, and the
remaining bits were used by the organization assigned the network to
differentiate hosts on the network.  Most organizations with class A
networks also subdivided their networks into subnetworks, or subnets,
adding another level of hierarchy to the addressing scheme.  Class B
networks devoted two octets to the network identifier and two to the
host; class C networks gave three octets to the network identifier and
one to the host.</P
><p class="para">Unfortunately, this small/medium/large system of networks didn't
work well for everyone.  Many organizations were large enough to
require several class C networks, which could accommodate at most 254
hosts, but too small to warrant a full class B network, which could
serve 65534 hosts.  Many of these organizations were allocated class B
networks, anyway.  Consequently, class B networks quickly became
scarce.</P
><p class="para">To help solve this problem, and create networks that were just
the right size for all sorts of organizations, Classless Inter-Domain
Routing, or <span class="acronym">CIDR</SPAN
> (pronounced <span class="quote">"cider"</SPAN
>)
was developed.  As the name implies, <span class="acronym">CIDR</SPAN
> does away
with the old class A, class B, and class C network designations.
Instead of allocating either one, two, or three octets to the network
identifier, the allocator could allocate any number of contiguous bits
of the <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> address to the network identifier.  So,
for example, if an organization needed an address space roughly four
times as large as a class B network, the powers-that-be could assign
it a network identifier of 14 bits, leaving 18 bits (four class Bs'
worth) of space to use.</P
><p class="para">Naturally, the advent of <span class="acronym">CIDR</SPAN
> made the
<span class="quote">"classful"</SPAN
> terminology outdated&nbsp;- although it's still used
a good deal in casual conversation.  Now, to designate a particular
<span class="acronym">CIDR</SPAN
> network, we specify the particular high-order
bit value assigned to an organization, expressed in dotted octet
notation, and how many bits identify the network.  The two terms are
separated by a slash.  So 15/8 is the old, class A-sized network that
begins with the bit pattern 00001111.  The old, class B-sized network
128.32.0.0 is now 128.32/16.  And the network 192.168.0.128/25
consists of the 128 <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> addresses from 192.168.0.128
to 192.168.0.255.</P

<span class="acronym">ARIN</SPAN

<span class="acronym">APNIC</SPAN
