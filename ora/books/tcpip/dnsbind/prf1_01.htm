Domain Name System&nbsp;- yet&nbsp;- but whenever you use the Internet,
you use <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
>.  Every time you send electronic mail
or surf the World Wide Web, you rely on the Domain Name System.</P
><p class="para">You see, while you, as a human being, prefer to remember the
<em class="emphasis">names</EM
> of computers, computers like to address each other by number. On
an internet, that number is 32 bits long, or between zero and four
billion or so.[1] That's easy for a computer to remember, because computers
have lots of memory ideal for storing numbers, but it isn't nearly as
easy for us humans. Pick ten phone numbers out of the phone book at
random, and then try to remember them. Not easy? Now flip to the front
of the book and attach random area codes to the phone numbers. That's
about how difficult it would be to remember ten arbitrary internet
addresses.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[1]  And, with <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> version 6, it's soon to be a
whopping 128 bits long, or between zero and a decimal number with 39
digits.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">This is part of the reason we need the Domain Name
System. <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> handles mapping between host names,
which we humans find convenient, and internet addresses, which
computers deal with.  In fact, <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> is the standard
mechanism on the Internet for advertising and accessing all kinds of
information about hosts, not just addresses.  And
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> is used by virtually all internetworking
software, including electronic mail, remote terminal programs such as
<kbd class="command">telnet</KBD
>, file transfer programs such as
<kbd class="command">ftp</KBD
>, and web browsers such as Netscape Navigator
and Microsoft Internet Explorer.</P
><p class="para">Another important feature of <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> is that it
makes host information available <em class="emphasis">all over</EM
> the Internet. Keeping
information about hosts in a formatted file on a single computer only
helps users on that computer. <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> provides a means
of retrieving information remotely, from anywhere on the
network.</P
><p class="para">More than that, <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> lets you distribute the
management of host information among many sites and organizations.
You don't need to submit your data to some central site or
periodically retrieve copies of the <span class="quote">"master"</SPAN
>
database. You simply make sure your section, called a
<i class="firstterm">zone</I
>, is up to date on your <i class="firstterm">name
servers</I
>. Your name servers make your zone's data available
to all the other name servers on the network.</P
><p class="para">Because the database is distributed, the system also needs the
ability to locate the data you're looking for by searching a number of
possible locations. The Domain Name System gives name servers the
intelligence to navigate through the database and find data in any
zone.</P
><p class="para">Of course, <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> does have a few problems. For
example, the system allows more than one name server to store data
about a zone, for redundancy's sake. But inconsistencies can crop up
between copies of the zone data.</P
><p class="para">But the <em class="emphasis">worst</EM
> problem with
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> is that despite its widespread use on the
Internet, there's really very little<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-54"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-57"></A
>
documentation about managing and maintaining it. Most administrators
on the Internet make do with the documentation their vendors see fit
to provide, and with whatever they can glean from following the
Internet mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups on the subject.</P
><p class="para">This lack of documentation means that the understanding of an
enormously important internet service&nbsp;- one of the linchpins of
today's Internet&nbsp;- is either handed down from administrator to
administrator like a closely-guarded family recipe, or relearned
repeatedly by isolated programmers and engineers. New administrators
of domains suffer through the same mistakes made by countless
others.</P
><p class="para">Our aim with this book is to help remedy this situation. We
realize that not all of you have the time or the desire to become
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> experts. Most of you, after all, have plenty to
do besides managing a domain or a name server: system administration,
network engineering, or software development. It takes an awfully big
institution to devote a whole person to <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
>. We'll
try to give you enough information to allow you to do what you need to
do, whether that's running a small domain or managing a multinational
monstrosity, tending a single name server or shepherding a hundred of
them. Read as much as you need to know now, and come back later if you
need to know more.</P
><p class="para"><span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> is a big topic&nbsp;- big enough to
require two authors, anyway&nbsp;- but we've tried to present it as
sensibly and understandably as possible.  The first two chapters give
you a good theoretical overview and enough practical information to
get by, and later chapters fill in the nitty-gritty details. We
provide a roadmap up front, to suggest a path through the book
appropriate for your job or interest.</P
><p class="para">When we talk about actual <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> software, we'll
concentrate almost exclusively on <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
>, the
Berkeley Internet Name Domain software, which is the most popular
implementation of the <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> specs (and the one we
know best). We've tried to distill our experience in managing and
maintaining a domain with <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> into this
book&nbsp;- a domain, incidentally, that is one of the largest on the
Internet. (We don't mean to brag, but we can use the credibility.)
Where possible, we've included the real programs that we use in
administration, many of them rewritten into Perl for speed and
efficiency.</P
><p class="para">We hope that this book will help you get acquainted with
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> and <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> if you're just
starting out, let you refine your understanding if you're already
familiar with them, and provide valuable insight and experience even
if you know 'em like the back of your hand.</P

>This book deals with the new 8.1.2 version of <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
>
as well as the older 4.9 versions. While 8.1.2 is the most recent
version as of this writing, it hasn't made its way into many vendors'
versions of <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> yet, partly because 8.1.2 has only
recently been released, and many vendors are wary of using such new
software.  We will also occasionally mention other versions of
<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
>, especially 4.8.3, because many vendors
continue to ship code based on this older software as part of their
<span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN
> products.  Whenever a feature is available
only in the 4.8.3, 4.9, or 8.1.2 version, or there is a difference in
the behavior of the versions, we try to point out which version does
what.</P
><p class="para">We use<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-88"></A
>
<kbd class="command">nslookup</KBD
>, a name server utility program, a great
deal in our examples. The version of <kbd class="command">nslookup</KBD
> we
use is the one shipped with the 8.1.2 <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
>
code. Older versions of <kbd class="command">nslookup</KBD
> provide much, but
not quite all, of the functionality in the 8.1.2
<kbd class="command">nslookup</KBD
>. We have tried to use commands common to
most <kbd class="command">nslookup</KBD
>s in our examples; when this was not
possible, we tried to note it.</P
