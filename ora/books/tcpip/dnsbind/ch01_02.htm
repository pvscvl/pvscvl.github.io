in general, is in order. In print, the difference between the two
seems slight: one is always capitalized, one isn't. The distinction
between their meanings, however, <em class="emphasis">is</EM
> significant. The Internet, with a
capital <span class="quote">"I,"</SPAN

the <span class="acronym">ARPA</SPAN
>net and continues today as, roughly, the
confederation of all <span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
>/<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>
networks directly or indirectly connected to commercial
U.S. backbones. Seen close up, it's actually quite a few different
networks&nbsp;- commercial <span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
>/<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>
backbones, regional <span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
>/<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN

networks, corporate and U.S. government
<span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
>/<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN

<span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
>/<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> networks in other
countries&nbsp;- interconnected by high-speed digital circuits.</P
><p class="para">A lowercase internet, on the other hand, is simply any network
made up of multiple smaller networks using the same internetworking
protocols. An internet (little <span class="quote">"i"</SPAN

connected to the Internet (big <span class="quote">"I"</SPAN
>), nor does it
necessarily use <span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN
>/<span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
> as its
internetworking protocol.  There are isolated corporate internets, and
there are Xerox <span class="acronym">XNS</SPAN

><p class="para">The new term<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-419"></A

term for a <span class="acronym">TCP</SPAN

<span class="quote">"little i"</SPAN
> internet, used to emphasize the use of
technologies developed and introduced on the Internet within a
company's internal corporate network. An <span class="quote">"extranet,"</SPAN

the other hand, is an internet that connects partner companies, or a
company to its distributors, suppliers, and customers.</P

>Through the 1970s, the <span class="acronym">ARPA</SPAN

friendly community of a few hundred hosts.  A single file,
<i class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I

needed to know about those hosts: it held a name-to-address mapping
for every host connected to the <span class="acronym">ARPA</SPAN

familiar <span class="acronym">UNIX</SPAN

<i class="filename">/etc/hosts</I

current <i class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I

into a new <i class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I

<span class="acronym">ARPA</SPAN

unworkable.  The size of <i class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I
> grew in
proportion to the growth in the number of <span class="acronym">ARPA</SPAN
>net
hosts. Moreover, the traffic generated by the update process increased
even faster: every additional host meant not only another line in
<i class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I
>, but potentially another host updating
from <i class="systemitem.sitename"><span class="acronym">SRI-NIC</SPAN
></I

addresses in a way that guaranteed uniqueness, it had no authority
over host names. There was nothing to prevent someone from adding a
host with a conflicting name and breaking the whole scheme. Someone
adding a host with the same name as a major mail hub, for example,
could disrupt mail service to much of the
<span class="acronym">ARPA</SPAN

changed addresses, or a new host had sprung up that users wanted to

><p class="para">The essential problem was that the
<i class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I

well. Ironically, the success of the <span class="acronym">ARPA</SPAN

experiment led to the failure and obsolescence of
<i class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I

><p class="para">The <span class="acronym">ARPA</SPAN
>net's governing bodies chartered an
investigation into a successor for
<i class="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I
>. Their goal was to create a system that
solved the problems inherent in a unified host table system. The new
system should allow local administration of data, yet make that data
globally available. The decentralization of administration would
eliminate the single-host bottleneck and relieve the traffic
problem. And local management would make the task of keeping data
up-to-date much easier. It should use a hierarchical name space to
name hosts.  This would ensure the uniqueness of names.</P

Mockapetris, then of <span class="acronym">USC</SPAN

Sciences Institute, was responsible for designing the architecture of
the new system. In 1984, he released <span class="acronym">RFC</SPAN
>s 882 and
883, which describe the Domain Name System.  These
<span class="acronym">RFC</SPAN
>s were superseded by <span class="acronym">RFC</SPAN
>s
1034 and 1035, the current specifications of the Domain Name
System.[2] <span class="acronym">RFC</SPAN
>s 1034 and 1035 have now been
augmented by many other <span class="acronym">RFC</SPAN
>s, which describe
potential <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN
> security problems, implementation
problems, administrative gotchas, mechanisms for dynamically updating
name servers and for securing domain data, and more.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[2] <span class="acronym">RFC</SPAN

of the relatively informal procedure for introducing new technology on
the Internet. <span class="acronym">RFC</SPAN

intended for implementors.</P
