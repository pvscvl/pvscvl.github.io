></H2
><p class="para">The authors would like to thank Ken Stone, Jerry McCollom, Peter
Jeffe, Christopher Durham, Hal Stern, Bill Wisner, Dave Curry, Jeff
Okamoto, Brad Knowles, K. Robert Elz, and Paul Vixie for their
invaluable contributions to this book. We'd also like to thank our
reviewers, Eric Pearce, Jack Repenning, Andrew Cherenson, Dan Trinkle,
Bill LeFebvre, and John Sechrest for their criticism and
suggestions. Without their help, this book would not be what it is
(it'd be much shorter!).</P
><p class="para">For the second edition, the authors would like to add their
thanks to their sterling review team: Dave Barr, Nigel Campbell, Bill
LeFebvre, Mike Milligan, and Dan Trinkle.</P
><p class="para">For the third edition, the authors salute their technical review
Dream Team: Bob Halley, Barry Margolin and Paul Vixie.</P
><p class="para">Cricket would particularly like to thank his former manager,
Rick Nordensten, who is the very model of a modern
<span class="acronym">HP</SPAN
> manager, on whose watch the first version of
this book was written; his neighbors, who bore his occasional
crabbiness for many months; and of course his wife, Paige, for her
unflagging support and for putting up with his tap-tap-tapping during
her nap-nap-napping.  For the second edition, Cricket would like to
add a thank you to his former managers, Regina Kershner and Paul
Klouda, for their support of Cricket's work with the Internet. For the
third edition, Cricket acknowledges a debt of gratitude to his
partner, Matt Larson, for his co-development of the Acme Razor.</P
><p class="para">Paul would like to thank his wife Katherine for her patience,
for many review sessions, and for proving that she could make a quilt
in her spare time more quickly than her spouse could write his half of
a book.</P
><p class="para">We would also like to thank the folks at O'Reilly &amp;
Associates for their hard work and patience. Credit is especially due
our editor, Mike Loukides; our production editor for the second
edition, Nancy Kotary; Ellie Fountain Maden (third edition), Robert
Romano (third edition), Steven Abrams; our production copy editor,
Kismet McDonough-Chan; our indexers, Seth Maislin (second and third
editions) and Ellie Cutler (first edition); our production tools
specialists, Mike Sierra and Lenny Muellner; and our illustrator,
Chris Reilley (second edition). Thanks besides to Jerry Peek, for all
sorts of miscellaneous help, and to Tim O'Reilly, for inspiring us to
put it all in print.</P
><p class="para">And thanks, Edie, for the cricket on the cover!</P
