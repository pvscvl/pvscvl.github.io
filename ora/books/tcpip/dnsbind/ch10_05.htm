multihomed host is local and shares a network with your host, one of

multihomed host is remote, you <em class="emphasis">may</EM

performance by using one of the interfaces instead of another, but
often it doesn't matter much which address is used. In days past, net
10 (the former <span class="acronym">ARPA</SPAN

>) was
always closer than any other remote address. The Internet has improved
drastically since those days, so you won't often see a marked
improvement by preferring one network over another for remote
multihomed hosts, but we'll cover that case anyway.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-10965"></A
>Before we get into address sorting by a name server, you should
first look at whether address sorting by the resolver better suits
your needs. (See the section called <span class="quote">"The sortlist
Directive"</SPAN
> in <a class="xref" href="ch06_01.htm" title="Configuring Hosts">Chapter 6, <cite class="chapter">Configuring Hosts</CITE
></A
>.) Since your resolver
and name server may be on different networks, it often makes more
sense for the resolver to sort addresses optimally for its
host. Address sorting at the name server works fairly well, but it
won't be optimal for every resolver it services.  Resolver address
sorting was added at 4.9. If your resolver (not your name server) is
older than 4.9, you are out of luck. You'll have to make do with
address sorting at the name server, which was introduced in
4.8.3.</P
><p class="para">We should also mention that address sorting is not supported in
<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> 8.  For <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> 8, the
developers removed address sorting because they believed that it had
no place in the server.</P

>Let's deal with the local multihomed host first. Suppose you have a
source host (i.e., a host that keeps your master sources) on two
networks, cleverly called network A and network B, and this host uses
<span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
> to export filesystems to hosts on both
networks. Hosts on network A will experience better performance if
they use the source host's interface to network A. Likewise, hosts on
network B would benefit from using the source host's interface to
network B for the address of the <span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN

<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> returns all the addresses for a multihomed
host. There was no guarantee of the order in which a
<span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN

assigned aliases (<i class="systemitem.sitename">wh249</I

<i class="systemitem.sitename">wh253</I

interfaces. If one interface was preferable, you (or more
realistically, a <span class="acronym">DNS</SPAN

appropriate alias to get the correct address. You
<em class="emphasis">can</EM

<span class="quote">"closer"</SPAN

<span class="acronym">NFS</SPAN
> mounts), but because of address sorting, they
are not always necessary.</P
><p class="para"><span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN
> 4 servers, by default, sort addresses if
one condition holds: if the host that sent the query to the name
server <em class="emphasis">shares</EM

(e.g., both are on network A), then <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

addresses in the response. How does <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

it shares a network with the querier? It knows because when
<span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

addresses of the host it is running on. <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

extracts the network numbers from these addresses to create the
default sort list. When a query is received, <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

checks if the sender's address is on a network in the default sort
list. If it is, then the query is local and <span class="acronym">BIND</SPAN

sorts the addresses in the response.</P
><p class="para">In <a class="xref" href="#DNS3-CHP-10-FIG-3" title="Communicating with a local multihomed host">Figure 10.3</A

hosts are on network B. In both of these cases, the name server sorts
the addresses in the response because the hosts share a network with

case, you'd have to run an additional name server on network B for

><p class="para">As you can see, you benefit by running a name server on each

down, it also sorts addresses of multihomed hosts. Because the name
server sorts addresses, you do not need to specify aliases for

for special reasons it has a network 26 connection. Since the router
to network 26 is always overloaded, you'll get better performance by
using the remote host's net 10 address. <a class="xref" href="#DNS3-CHP-10-FIG-4" title="Communicating with a remote multihomed host">Figure 10.4</A
