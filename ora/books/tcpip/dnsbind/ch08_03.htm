>When you get around to setting up more and more name servers, a
question may strike you&nbsp;- must I register <em class="emphasis">all</EM
>
of my primary and slave name servers with my parent zone? No, only
those servers you want to make available to servers outside of your
zone need to be registered with the parent. For instance, if you run
nine name servers for your zone, you may choose to tell the parent
zone about only four of them. Within your zone, all nine servers are
used. Five of those nine servers, however, are only queried by
resolvers on hosts that are configured to query them (in
<i class="filename">resolv.conf</I
>, for example). Their parent name
servers will never delegate to them, since they're not registered in
the domain name space. Only the four servers registered with your
parent zone are queried by other name servers, including caching-only
and partial-slave name servers within your domain. This setup is shown
in <a class="xref" href="#DNS3-CHP-8-FIG-2" title="Registering only some of your name servers">Figure 8.2</A
>.</P

><img class="graphic" src="figs/dns3_0802.gif" alt="Figure 8.2"><p class="para">Besides being able to pick and choose which of your name servers
are hammered by outside queries, there's a technical motivation for
registering only some of your zone's name servers: there is a limit to
how many servers will fit in a<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8800"></A

<span class="acronym">UDP</SPAN
> response packet. In practice, around ten name
server records should fit. Depending on the data (how many servers are
in the same domain), you could get more or fewer.[9] There's not much point in registering more than ten
servers, anyway&nbsp;- if none of the ten servers can be reached, it's
unlikely the destination host can be reached.</P

>If you've set up a new authoritative name server, and you decide it
should be registered, make a list of the parents of the zones it's
authoritative for. You'll need to contact the administrators for each
of these parent zones. For example, let's say we want to register the
name server we set up on <i class="systemitem.sitename">zardoz</I
> above.  In order to get this slave
registered in all the right zones, we'll need to contact the
administrators of <i class="systemitem.sitename">edu</I

<i class="systemitem.sitename">in-addr.arpa</I

><p class="para">When you contact the administrators of a parent zone, be sure to
fill out the form they specify (if any) on their web site.  If there's
no standard form, give them the domain name of the zone the new name
server is authoritative for. If the new name server is in the new
zone, you'll also need to give them the <span class="acronym">IP</SPAN
>
address(es) of the new name server. In fact, if there's no official
format for submitting the information, it's often best just to send
your parent the complete list of registered name servers for the zone,
plus any addresses necessary, in data file format. That avoids any
potential confusion.</P

I've just set up a new slave name server on
zardoz.movie.edu for the 249.249.192.in-addr.arpa
and 253.253.192.in-addr.arpa zones.  Would you
please add NS records for this name server to the
in-addr.arpa zone?  That would make our delegation
information look like:

253.253.192.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN NS terminator.movie.edu.
253.253.192.in-addr.arpa. 86400 IN NS wormhole.movie.edu.

don't need to keep track of which name servers are authoritative for
which zones. All of your parent zones can delegate to the same set of

>Caching-only name servers, on the other hand, must
<em class="emphasis">never</EM

rarely has complete information for any given zone, just the bits and
pieces of it that it has looked up recently. If a parent name server
were mistakenly to refer a foreign name server to a caching-only name
server, the foreign name server would send the caching-only name
server a nonrecursive query.  The caching-only name server might have
the data cached, but then again, it might not. If it didn't have the
data, it would refer the querier to the best name servers it knew
(those closest to the domain in the query)&nbsp;- which might include
the caching-only name server itself! The poor foreign name server
might never get an answer.  This kind of
misconfiguration&nbsp;- actually, delegating a zone to any name server
not authoritative for that zone&nbsp;- is known as<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8851"></A
