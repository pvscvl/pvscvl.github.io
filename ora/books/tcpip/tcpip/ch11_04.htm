incoming connections, can run for a long time with the wrong address
without its user noticing the problem. Additionally, the system that
suffers the ill effects may not be the one that is misconfigured. It
is possible for someone to accidentally use your IP address on his
system, and for his mistake to cause your system intermittent
communications problems. An example of this problem is discussed
later. This type of configuration error cannot be discovered by

held in the table for a finite lifetime and are deleted when that
lifetime expires. New values are then obtained via the ARP protocol.
Therefore, if some remote interfaces change,
the local table adjusts and communications continue. Usually this is a
good idea, but if someone is using the wrong IP address, that bad
address can keep reappearing in the ARP table even if it is deleted.
However,  manually entered values are permanent; they stay in the table
and can only be deleted manually. This allowed us to install a correct

didn't. From the first three bytes of this address, 0:0:c0, we knew
that the device was a Western Digital card. Since our network has only
UNIX workstations and PCs, we assumed the Western Digital card was
installed in a PC. We also guessed that the problem address was
recently installed because the user had never had the problem
before. We sent out an urgent announcement to all users asking if
anyone had recently installed a new PC, reconfigured a PC, or
installed TCP/IP software on a PC. We got one response. When we
checked his system, we found out that he had entered the address
172.16.180.130 when he should have entered 172.16.180.138. The address
was corrected and the problem did not recur.</P

><p class="para">The most effective way to subdivide an Ethernet is to install an
Ethernet switch. Each port on the switch is essentially a separate
Ethernet. So a 16-port switch gives you 16 Ethernets to work
with when balancing the load. On most switches the
ports can be used in a variety of ways (see 
<a class="xref" href="#TCP2-CH-11-FIG-0" title="Subdividing an Ethernet with switches">Figure 11.1</A
>
Lightly used
systems can be attached to a hub that is then attached to one of the
switch ports to allow the systems to share a single segment. Servers<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15838"></A
>
and demanding systems can be given dedicated ports so that they don't
need to share a segment with anyone. Additionally, some switches<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15841"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15844"></A
>
provide a few Fast Ethernet 100 Mbps ports. These are called asymmetric
switches because different ports operate at different speeds. Use the
Fast Ethernet ports to connect heavily used servers. If you're buying a<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15847"></A
>
new switch, buy a 10/100 switch with auto-sensing ports. This allows
every port to be used at either 100 Mbps or at 10 Mbps, which give you
the maximum configuration flexibility.</P

shows an 8-port 10/100 Ethernet switch. Ports 1 and 2 are<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15852"></A
>
wired to Ethernet hubs. A few systems are connected to each hub. When
new systems are added they are distributed evenly among the hubs to
prevent any one segment from becoming overloaded. Additional hubs can
be added to the available switch ports for future expansion. Port 4
attaches a demanding system with its own private segment. Port 6
operates at 100 Mbps and attaches a heavily used server. A port can be
reserved for a future 100 Mbps connection to a second 10/100 Ethernet
switch for even more expansion.</P

><img class="graphic" src="figs/tcp2_1101.gif" alt="Figure 11.1"><p class="para">Before allocating the ports on your switch, evaluate what services are
in demand, and who talks to whom. Then develop a plan that reduces the
amount of traffic flowing over any segment. For example, if the
demanding system on Port 4 uses lots of bandwidth because it is
constantly talking to one of the systems on Port 1, all of the systems
on Port 1 will suffer because of this traffic. The computer that the
demanding system communicates with should be moved to one of the vacant
ports or to the same port (4) as the demanding system. Use your switch
to the greatest advantage by balancing the load.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15859"></A

Don't sit on a problem expecting it to go away. It could easily get
worse.</P
><p class="para">If the problem is in your local area network, you will have to handle
it yourself. Some tools, such as the cable tester described above, can
help. But frequently the only way to approach a hardware problem is by
brute force&nbsp;- disconnecting pieces of hardware until you find the one
causing the problem. It is most convenient to do this at the switch or hub. If you identify a device causing the problem, repair<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15886"></A

or replace it. Remember that the problem can be the cable itself, rather
than any particular device.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15889"></A
