address class. The class A address is 10.104.0.19. The first bit of
this address is 0, so the address is interpreted as host 104.0.19 on
network 10. One byte specifies the network and three bytes specify the
host. In the address 172.16.12.1, the two high-order bits are 1 0 so
the address refers to host 12.1 on network 172.16. Two bytes identify the
network and two identify the host. Finally, in the class C example,
192.168.16.1, the three high-order bits are 1 1 0, so this is the
address of host 1 on network 192.168.16&nbsp;- three network bytes and one
host byte.</P

protocol suite. However, the original class structure of the IP address
has weaknesses. The TCP/IP designers did not envision the enormous
scale of today's network. When TCP/IP was being designed, networking
was limited to large organizations that could afford substantial
computer systems. The idea of a powerful UNIX system on every desktop
did not exist. At that time, a 32-bit address seemed so large that
it was divided into classes to reduce the processing load on routers,
even though dividing the address into classes sharply reduced the number
of host addresses actually available for use. For example, assigning a
large network a single class B address, instead of six class C addresses,
reduced the load on the router because the router needed to keep only one
route for that entire organization. However, an organization that was
given the class B address probably did not have 64,000 computers, so most
of the host addresses available to the organization were never assigned.</P
><p class="para">The class-structured address design was critically strained by the
rapid growth of the Internet.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1583"></A

At one point it appeared that all class
B addresses might be rapidly exhausted.

>The rapid depletion of the class B addresses showed that three primary
address classes were not enough: class A was much too large and class
C was much too small. Even a class B address was too large for many

><p class="para">The obvious solution to the class B address crisis was to force
organizations to use multiple class C addresses. There were millions
of these addresses available and they were in no immediate danger of

>
As is often the case, the obvious solution is not as simple as it may
seem. Each class C address requires its own entry within the routing
table. Assigning thousands or millions of class C addresses would
cause the routing table to grow so rapidly that the routers would soon
be overwhelmed. The solution required a new way of assigning addresses
and a new way of looking at addresses.</P
><p class="para">Originally network addresses were assigned in more or less sequential
order as they were requested. This worked fine when the network was
small and centralized. However, it did not take network topology into
account.  Thus only random chance would determine if the same
intermediate routers would be used to reach network 195.4.12.0 and
network 195.4.13.0, which makes it difficult to reduce the size of the
routing table.  Addresses can only be aggregated if they are
contiguous numbers and are reachable through the same route. For
example, if addresses are contiguous for one service provider, a
single route can be created for that aggregation because that service
provide will have a limited number of routes to the Internet. But if
one network address is in France and the next contiguous address is in
Australia, creating a consolidated route<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1601"></A
>
for these addresses does not work.</P
><p class="para">Today, large, contiguous blocks<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1605"></A
>
of addresses are assigned to
large network service providers in a manner that better reflects the
topology of the network.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1609"></A
>
The service providers then allocate chunks of
these address blocks to the organizations to which they provide network
services. This alleviates the short-term shortage of class B addresses
and, because the assignment of addressees reflects the topology of the
network, it permits route aggregation. Under this new scheme, we know that
network 195.4.12.0 and network 195.4.13.0 are reachable through the same
intermediate routers. In fact, both of these addresses are in the range
of the addresses assigned to Europe, 194.0.0.0 to 195.255.255.255.
Assigning addresses that reflect the topology of the network enables
route aggregation, but does not implement it. As long as network
195.4.12.0 and network 195.4.13.0 are interpreted as separate class
C addresses, they will require separate entries in the routing table.
A new, flexible way of defining addresses is needed.</P
><p class="para">Evaluating addresses according to the class rules discussed above
limits the length of network numbers to 8, 16, or 24 bits&nbsp;- 1, 2, or
3 bytes. The IP address, however, is not really byte-oriented. It is
32 contiguous bits. A more flexible way to interpret the network and
host portions of an address is with a <em class="emphasis">bit mask</EM
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1614"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1616"></A
>
An address bit mask works in this way: if a bit is on in the mask,
that equivalent bit in the address is interpreted as a network bit; if
a bit in the mask is off, the bit belongs to the host part of the
address. For example, if address 195.4.12.0 is interpreted as a class
C address, the first 24 bits are the network number and the last 8
bits are the host address. The network mask that represents this is
255.255.255.0, 24 bits on and 8 bits off.  The bit mask that is
derived from the traditional class structure is called the <em class="emphasis">default
mask</EM
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1619"></A
>
or the <em class="emphasis">natural mask</EM
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1623"></A
>
However, with bit masks we are no
longer limited by the address class structure.  A mask of 255.255.0.0
can be applied to network address 195.4.0.0.  This mask includes all
addresses from 195.4.0.0 to 195.4.255.255 in a single network
number. In effect, it creates a network number as large as a class B
network in the class C address space. Using bit masks to create
networks larger than the natural mask is called <em class="emphasis">supernetting</EM

easily be interpreted as a host address.  RFC 1878 list all 32
possible prefix values. But little documentation is needed because the
CIDR prefix is much easier to understand and remember than are address
classes. I know that 10.104.0.19 is a class A address, but writing it
as 10.104.0.19/8 shows me that this address has 8 bits for the network

remember anything about the class A address structure.</P
