>Proxy servers provide many of the same advantages as NAT boxes. In
fact, these terms are often used interchangeably. But there are
differences. Proxy servers are application gateways originally created
as part of firewall systems to improve security. Internal systems
connect to the outside world through the proxy server, and external
systems respond to the proxy server. Unlike routers, even routers with
network address translation, the external systems do not see a network
of internal systems. They see only one system&nbsp;- the proxy server. All

IP address: the address of the proxy server. Therefore, the difference
between NAT boxes and proxy servers is that NAT uses a pool of IP
addresses to differentiate the connection between internal and external
systems. The true proxy server has only one address and therefore must
use protocol numbers and port numbers to differentiate the connections.</P

subnetting. It can be just an organizational device for delegating
authority. Delegating authority for groups of addresses is often very
convenient for large networks, while small networks tend to assign host
addresses one at a time. No matter how addresses are assigned,
someone must retain sufficient central control to prevent duplication
and to ensure that the addresses are recorded correctly on

are always handled by a server, such as PPP or DHCP. Before installing a
server for dynamic addressing, make sure it is useful for your purposes.
Dynamic PPP addressing is useful for servers that handle many remote
dial-in clients that connect for a short duration. If the PPP server
is used to connect together various parts of the enterprise network and
has long-lived connections, dynamic addressing is probably unnecessary.
Likewise, the dynamic address assignment features of DHCP are of most
use if you have mobile systems in your network that move between subnets

configuration of network interfaces; and automatically, through routing
protocols. Old routing protocols cannot distribute subnet masks, and
old operating systems cannot store the masks in the routing table. In an
environment that contains these old systems, every device on the network
must use the same subnet mask because every computer believes that the
entire network is subnetted in exactly the same way as its local subnet.</P

Using variable-length subnet masks increases the flexibility and power of 
subnetting. Assume you wanted to divide 192.168.5.0/24 into three networks: 
one network of 110 hosts, one network of 50 hosts, and one network of 60 hosts.
Using traditional subnet masks, a single subnet mask would have to be
chosen and applied to the entire address space. At best this would be
a compromise. With variable length subnet masks you could use a mask
of 255.255.255.128, which creates subnets of 126 hosts, for the large
subnet and a mask of 255.255.255.192 to create subnets of 62 hosts for
the smaller subnets. VLSMs, however, require UNIX kernels<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4342"></A
