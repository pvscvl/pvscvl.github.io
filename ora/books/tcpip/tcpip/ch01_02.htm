>To discuss computer networking, it is necessary to use terms that have
special meaning. Even other computer
professionals may not be familiar with all the terms in the
networking alphabet soup. As is always the case, English and
computer-speak are not equivalent (or even necessarily compatible)
languages. Although descriptions and examples<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-350"></A
>
should make the meaning
of the networking jargon more apparent, sometimes terms are ambiguous.
A common frame of reference is necessary for understanding data
communications terminology.</P
><p class="para">An architectural model developed by the International Standards<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-353"></A
>
Organization (ISO) is frequently used to describe the structure and
function of data communications protocols.<a class="indexterm" name="TCP2-CH-1-IX-OPEN-SYSTEMS-INTERCONNECT-OSI-REFERENCE-MODEL"></A
>
This architectural model,
which is called the <em class="emphasis">Open Systems Interconnect Reference Model</EM
> (OSI),
provides a common reference for discussing communications. The terms
defined by this model are well understood and widely used in the data
communications community&nbsp;- so widely used, in fact, that it is difficult
to discuss data communications without using OSI's terminology.</P
><p class="para">The OSI Reference Model contains seven <em class="emphasis">layers</EM
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-360"></A
>
that define the
functions of data communications protocols. Each layer of the OSI model
represents a function performed when data is transferred between
cooperating applications across an intervening network.
<a class="xref" href="#TCP2-CH-1-FIG-0" title="The OSI Reference Model">Figure 1.1</A
>
identifies each layer by name and provides a short functional
description for it. Looking at this figure, the protocols are like a
pile of building blocks stacked one upon another. Because of this
appearance, the structure is often called a <em class="emphasis">stack</EM
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-364"></A
>
or <em class="emphasis">protocol stack</EM
>.</P
><h4 class="figure"><a class="title" name="TCP2-CH-1-FIG-0">Figure 1.1: The OSI Reference Model</A
></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/tcp2_0101.gif" alt="Figure 1.1"><p class="para">A layer does not define a single protocol&nbsp;- it defines a data
communications function that may be performed by any number of
protocols. Therefore, each layer may contain multiple protocols, each
providing a service suitable to the function of that layer. For
example, a file transfer protocol and an electronic mail protocol both
provide user services, and both are part of the Application Layer.</P
><p class="para">Every protocol communicates with its peer. A <em class="emphasis">peer</EM
> is an
implementation of the same protocol in the equivalent layer on a remote
system; i.e., the local file transfer protocol is the peer of a remote
file transfer protocol. Peer-level communications<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-374"></A
>
must be standardized
for successful communications to take place. In the abstract, each
protocol is concerned only with communicating to its peer; it does not
care about the layer above or below it.</P
><p class="para">However, there must also be agreement on how to pass data between the
layers on a single computer, because every layer is involved in sending
data from a local application to an equivalent remote application. The
upper layers rely on the lower layers
to transfer the data over the underlying network. Data is passed down
the stack from one layer to the next, until it is transmitted over the
network by the Physical Layer protocols. At the remote end, the data is
passed up the stack to the receiving application. The individual layers
do not need to know how the layers above and below them function; they
only need to know how to pass data to them. Isolating network
communications functions in different layers minimizes the impact of
technological change on the entire protocol<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-378"></A
>
suite. New applications can
be added without changing the physical network, and new network hardware
can be installed without rewriting the application software.</P
><p class="para">Although the OSI model is useful, the TCP/IP protocols don't
match its structure exactly.  
Therefore, in our discussions of TCP/IP, we use
the layers of the OSI model in the following way:</P
><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Application&nbsp;Layer</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-388"></A
>The Application Layer is the level of the protocol hierarchy where
user-accessed network processes reside. In this text, a TCP/IP
application is any network process that occurs above the Transport
Layer. This includes all of the processes that users directly interact
with, as well as other processes at this level that users are not
necessarily aware of.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Presentation&nbsp;Layer</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-395"></A
>For cooperating applications to exchange data, they must agree about
how data is represented. In OSI, this layer provides standard data
presentation routines. This function is frequently handled within the
applications in TCP/IP, though increasingly TCP/IP protocols such as<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-397"></A
>
XDR and MIME<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-399"></A
>
perform this function.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Session&nbsp;Layer</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-406"></A
>As with the Presentation Layer, the Session Layer is not identifiable
as a separate layer in the TCP/IP protocol hierarchy. The OSI Session
Layer manages the sessions (connection) between cooperating
applications. In TCP/IP, this function largely occurs in the Transport
Layer, and the term &quot;session&quot; is not used. For TCP/IP, the terms<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-408"></A
>
&quot;socket&quot; and &quot;port&quot;<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-410"></A
>
are used to describe the path over which
cooperating applications communicate.</P

><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Transport&nbsp;Layer</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-417"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-419"></A
>Much of our discussion of TCP/IP is directed to the protocols that
occur in the Transport Layer. The Transport Layer in the OSI reference
model guarantees that
the receiver gets the data exactly as it was sent. In TCP/IP this
function is performed by the <em class="emphasis">Transmission Control Protocol</EM
>
(TCP). However, TCP/IP offers a second Transport Layer service,
<em class="emphasis">User Datagram Protocol</EM
> (UDP),<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-424"></A
>
that does not perform the
end-to-end reliability checks.</P

><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Network&nbsp;Layer</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-431"></A
>The Network Layer manages connections across the network and isolates
the upper layer protocols from the details of the underlying network.
The Internet Protocol (IP), which isolates the upper layers from the
underlying network and handles the addressing and delivery of data, is
usually described as TCP/IP's Network Layer.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Data&nbsp;Link&nbsp;Layer</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-438"></A
>The reliable delivery of data across the underlying physical network
is handled by the Data Link Layer. TCP/IP rarely creates protocols in
the Data Link Layer. Most RFCs that relate to the Data Link Layer discuss how IP can make use of existing data link protocols.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Physical&nbsp;Layer</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-445"></A
>The Physical Layer defines the characteristics of the hardware needed to carry
the data transmission signal. Features such as voltage levels,<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-447"></A
>
and the
number and location of interface pins, are defined in this layer.
Examples of standards at the Physical Layer are interface connectors<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-449"></A
>
such as RS232C<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-452"></A
>
and V.35,<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-454"></A
>
and standards for local area network wiring
such as IEEE 802.3.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-456"></A
>
TCP/IP does not define physical standards&nbsp;- it
makes use of existing standards.</P
