><p class="para">The protocol wars are over and TCP/IP won. TCP/IP is now universally
recognized as the pre-eminent communications protocol for linking
together diverse computer systems. The importance of interoperable data
communications and global computer networks is no longer debated. But
that was not always the case. When I wrote the first edition of this book,
IPX was far and away the leading PC communications
protocol. Microsoft did not bundle communications protocols in their
operating system. Corporate networks were so dependent on SNA that
many corporate network administrators had not even heard of TCP/IP.
Even UNIX, the mother of TCP/IP, nursed a large number of pure UUCP
networks. Back then I felt compelled to tout the importance of TCP/IP
by pointing out that it was used on thousands of networks and hundreds of
thousands of computers. How times have changed! Today we count the hosts
and users connected to the Internet in the tens of millions. And the
Internet is only the tip of the TCP/IP iceberg. The largest market for
TCP/IP is in the corporate<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-20"></A
>
&quot;intranet.&quot; An intranet is a private TCP/IP
network used to disseminate information within the enterprise. The
competing network technologies have shrunk to niche markets where they
fill special needs&nbsp;- while TCP/IP has grown to be the communications
software that links the world.</P
><p class="para">The acceptance of TCP/IP as a worldwide standard and the size of its
global user base are not the only things that have changed. In 1991 I
lamented the lack of adequate documentation. At the time it was difficult
for a<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-24"></A
>
network administrator to find the information he or she needed
to do the job. Since that time there has been an explosion of books
about TCP/IP and the Internet. However, there are still too few books 
that concentrate on what a system administrator really needs to know 
about TCP/IP administration and too many books that try to tell you 
how to surf the Web. In this book I strive to focus on TCP/IP 
and UNIX, and not to be distracted by the phenomenon of the Internet.</P
><p class="para">I am very proud of the first edition of <em class="emphasis">TCP/IP Network
Administration</EM
>. In the second edition, I have done everything I can
to maintain the essential character of the book while making it better.
The Domain Name Service material has been updated to cover the latest
version of the<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-30"></A
>
BIND 4 software. The email configuration is now based on
sendmail<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-32"></A
>
version 8, and the operating system examples are from the current
versions of Solaris and Linux. The routing protocol coverage has been
expanded to include<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-35"></A
>
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Border Gateway<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-37"></A
>
Protocol (BGP). I have also added new topics such as<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-39"></A
>
one-time passwords and configuration servers based on Dynamic Host<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-42"></A
>
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Bootstrap Protocol<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-44"></A
>
(BOOTP). Despite the additional topics, the book has been kept to a reasonable length.</P
><p class="para">The bulk of this edition is derived directly from the first edition of
the book. To emphasize both that times have changed and that my focus
on practical information has not, I have left the introductory paragraphs
from the first edition intact.</P

><p class="para">The Internet, the world's largest network, grew from fewer than 6,000
computers at the end of 1986 to more than 600,000 computers five years
later.
[1]
This explosive growth demonstrates<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-53"></A
>
the incredible demand for network
services. This growth has taken place despite a lack of practical
information for network administrators. Most administrators have
been forced to content themselves with <b class="emphasis.bold">man</B
> pages, or protocol
documents and scholarly texts written from the point of view of the
protocol designer. For practical information, most of us have relied
on the advice of friends who had already networked their computers.
This book addresses the lack of information by providing practical,
detailed network information for the<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-57"></A
>
UNIX system administrator.</P

><p class="para">Networks have grown so extravagantly because they provide an important
service. It is in the nature of computers to generate and process
information, but this information is frequently useless unless it can
be shared with the people who need it. The network is the vehicle that
enables data to be easily shared. Once you network your computer,
you'll never want to be stuck on an isolated system again.</P
><p class="para">The common thread that ties the enormous Internet together is TCP/IP
network software. TCP/IP is a set of communications protocols that
define how different types of computers talk to each other. This is<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-62"></A
>
a book about building your own network based on TCP/IP. It is both
a tutorial covering the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; of TCP/IP networking, and a
reference manual for the details about specific network programs.</P
