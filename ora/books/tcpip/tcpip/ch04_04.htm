When you are reasonably sure the domain name is still available, start
your primary name server running. If you don't want to run your own
server, ask your ISP if they offer this service. If they don't, you
must either find a new ISP that does, or run the service yourself.</P
><p class="para">Having the primary server up and running doesn't mean that your
entire domain must be fully operational, but it does mean that a server
must be running to respond to basic queries. When asked,
the server should answer that it is the name server for your domain.
Configure the primary server as described in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring DNS Name Service ">Chapter 8</A
>. Test it with
<b class="emphasis.bold">nslookup</B

about itself, register the domain name.</P

tracking number that you use to monitor the status of your domain
registration.</P
><p class="para">Use the domain name registration form to change or delete your existing
domain name registration. Just fill in the form with the corrected
information and mail it to <a class="email" href="mailto:hostmaster@internic.net" title="hostmaster@internic.net">hostmaster@internic.net</A
> with a subject
line that contains either &quot;MODIFY DOMAIN&quot; or &quot;REMOVE DOMAIN&quot;, as
appropriate, followed by your domain name. In the very first field of the
application form, item 0, ask for the type of registration action:
either New (&quot;N&quot;), Modify (&quot;M&quot;), or Delete (&quot;D&quot;). 
Make sure the letter in this field matches the action indicated 
on the subject line when you mail in the application.</P
><p class="para">You're required to use email to submit the domain name application.
The logic behind this is that if you don't have at
least email access to the Internet, you don't need an Internet domain
name. This helps reduce the number of frivolous domain name requests,
and it automates part of the registration, further reducing the burden 
of handling domain name requests.</P
><p class="para">Another thing that dramatically reduces the number of frivolous domain
name applications is the $100 registration fee.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4502"></A
>
The registration service charges each domain $50 a year to be
maintained in the registry. The initial $100 fee covers the first two
years. Question 9 asks if the InterNIC should send the bill for the
registration fee to you via email or postal mail. Answer with an &quot;E&quot;
or a &quot;P&quot;.  If your &quot;bean counters&quot; will accept an email bill, go that
way. You'll get everything finished more quickly.</P
><p class="para">The application form is largely self-explanatory, but a few items
require some thought. Two things may be confusing&nbsp;- handles and servers.
One is the request for a <em class="emphasis">NIC handle</EM
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4506"></A
>
You have a NIC handle only
if you are registered in the <em class="emphasis">NIC white pages</EM
>. The white pages
(discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch12_01.htm" title="Network Security ">Chapter 12</A
>) is a directory of information about users,
networks, hosts, and domains. A NIC handle is a record identifier for
this directory. A personal NIC handle for a user entry is composed of
the user's initials and perhaps a number. For example, my initials are
<em class="emphasis">cwh</EM
> and my NIC handle is <em class="emphasis">cwh3</EM
>. It is unlikely that you will
have a handle unless you have contacted the NIC before. If you don't
have a handle, just leave it blank. The NIC will assign you one.</P
><p class="para">You're also asked for the names and addresses of your<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4514"></A
>
primary and secondary name servers.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4516"></A
>
The servers listed must be
operational and connected to the Internet.
[7]
Provide the full domain name of the primary server in response to
question 7a; e.g. <em class="emphasis">almond.nuts.com</EM
>. The primary server is usually
a name server located at your site, but not always. It isn't necessary
to provide your own primary server; and if you aren't directly
connected to the Internet, you can't. Even though you are not
connected, you may still want to register your domain name with the NIC
if you have email access to the Internet. This allows you to use an
email address that clearly identifies your organization. In order to
do this, the online service that receives your email must be able to
provide your primary name service. Check with them before you fill out
this form.</P

> tells you how to get a name server up and running.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">The secondary server should be on a separate physical network from the
primary server. Putting it on a different network guarantees that other
sites can look up information about your network, even if access to your
network is unavailable for some reason. A large organization may have
multiple independent networks, but for many sites this requirement means
asking another organization to provide a secondary name server. Who do
you ask?</P
><p class="para">Again, you should turn to the people who are providing your Internet
access. The network that connects you to the Internet should provide
secondary name servers as a service to its users. If they do not, they
should be able to point you to other organizations that do provide the
service. It is even possible for two organizations who are both
applying for new domains to provide secondary service for each other.
In other words, you provide someone with a secondary server; in return,
they provide a secondary server for you.</P
><p class="para">Read the instructions that come with the domain application. The remainder
of the form should be easy to fill out.</P

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="TCP2-CH-4-IX-HOSTS-NAMES-HN-CHOOSING"></A
>Once you have a domain name, you are responsible for assigning hostnames
within that domain. You must ensure that hostnames are unique within
your domain or subdomain, in the same way that host addresses must be
unique within a network or subnet. But there is more to choosing a host
name than just making sure the name is unique. Choosing a hostname is
a surprisingly emotional issue. Many people feel very strongly about
the name of their computer because they identify their computer with
themselves or their work.</P
><p class="para">RFC 1178 provides excellent guidelines on how to choose a hostname.
Some key suggestions from these guidelines are:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Use real words that are short, easy to spell, and easy to remember. The
point of using hostnames instead of IP addresses is that they are
easier to use. If hostnames are difficult to spell and remember, they
defeat their own purpose.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Use theme names. For example, all hosts in a group could be named after
human movements: fall, jump, hop, skip, walk, run, stagger, wiggle,
stumble, trip, limp, lurch, hobble, etc. Theme names are often easier to
choose than unrestricted names, and increase the sense of community
among network users.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Avoid using project names, personal names, acronyms, numeric names,
and technical jargon. Projects and users change over time. If you name a
computer after the person who is currently using it or the project it
is currently assigned to, you will probably have to rename the computer in
the future. Use nicknames to identify the server function of a system,
e.g., <em class="emphasis">www</EM
>, <em class="emphasis">ftp</EM
>, <em class="emphasis">ns</EM
>, etc. Nicknames can easily move
between systems if the server function moves. See the description of
CNAME records in <a class="xref" href="ch08_01.htm" title="Configuring DNS Name Service ">Chapter 8</A

><p class="para">The only requirement for a hostname is that it be unique within its
domain. But a well-chosen hostname can save future work and make the
