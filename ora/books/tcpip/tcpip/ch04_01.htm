><p class="para">In this chapter, our emphasis shifts from how TCP/IP functions to how it
is configured. While Chapters 1-3
describe the TCP/IP protocols and how they work, now we begin to explore 
the network configuration process. The first step in this process is planning.
Before configuring a host to run TCP/IP, you must have certain
information. At the very least, every host must have a unique IP
address and hostname.
You should also decide on the items below before configuring a system:<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-3954"></A

system online. The network administrator is<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4004"></A

responsible for making and
communicating decisions about overall network configuration. If you
have an established TCP/IP network, you can skip several sections in
this chapter, but you may still want to read about selecting hostnames,
planning mail systems, and other topics that affect mature networks as
much as they do new networks.</P
><p class="para">If you are creating a new TCP/IP network, you will have to make some
basic decisions. Will the new network connect to the Internet? If it
will, how is the connection to be made? How should the network number
be chosen? How do I register a domain name? How do I choose hostnames?
In the following sections, we cover the information you need to make 
these decisions.</P

>First, you must decide whether or not your new network will be directly
connected to the Internet. The Internet's administration makes a
distinction between networks connected to the Internet and those that
are not connected. A <em class="emphasis">connected network</EM

the Internet and has full access to other networks on the Internet.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4017"></A

A <em class="emphasis">non-connected network</EM

and its access to Internet networks is limited. An example of a
non-connected network is a TCP/IP network that attaches to the outside
world via a mail gateway at America Online (AOL).<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4020"></A

Users on the network can send mail to Internet hosts but they cannot<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4022"></A

><p class="para">Many TCP/IP networks are not connected to the Internet. On these
networks, TCP/IP is used for communication between the organization's
various networks. Private networks that interconnect the various parts of
an organization are often called <em class="emphasis">enterprise networks</EM
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4032"></A
>
When those
private networks use the information services applications that are built
on top of TCP/IP, particularly Web servers and browsers, to distribute
internal information, those networks are called <em class="emphasis">intranets</EM
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4036"></A
></P
><p class="para">There are a few basic reasons why many sites do not connect to the
Internet. One reason is security. Connecting to any network gives more
people access to your system. Connecting to a global network with<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4039"></A
>
millions of users is enough to scare any security expert. There is no
doubt about it: connecting to the Internet increases the security<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4042"></A
>
risks for your computer. <a class="xref" href="ch12_01.htm" title="Network Security ">Chapter 12, <cite class="chapter">Network Security </CITE
></A
>, covers some techniques for reducing
this risk.</P
><p class="para">Cost versus benefit is another consideration. Many organizations do not
see sufficient value in an Internet connection. For some organizations,
low use or limited requirements, such as only needing email access, make
the cost of an Internet connection exceed the benefit. For others, the
primary reason for an Internet connection is to provide information about
their products. It is not necessary to connect the entire enterprise
network to the Internet to do this. It is often sufficient to connect
a single Web server to the local Internet Service Provider (ISP)<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4047"></A
>
or to buy Web services from the ISP to provide information to your customers.</P
><p class="para">Other organizations consider an Internet connection an essential
requirement. Educational and research institutions depend on the 
Internet as a source of information. Many companies use it as a means 
of delivering service and support to their customers.</P
><p class="para">You may have both types of networks: a &quot;non-connected&quot; enterprise
network sitting behind a security firewall, and a small &quot;connected&quot;
network that provides services to your external customers and proxy
service for your internal users.</P
><p class="para">Unless you have carefully determined what your needs are and what an
Internet connection will cost, you cannot know whether an Internet
connection is right for your organization. Your local Internet service
provider (ISP) can give you the various cost and performance
alternatives. The next section offers ways to locate appropriate
ISPs. Regardless of whether or not you decide to connect your
network to the Internet, one thing is certain: you should build your
enterprise network using the TCP/IP protocols.</P

>Choosing an ISP for your network can be confusing. Currently more 
than 5,000 ISPs operate in the United States alone.
No attempt is made to list them all here. Instead we provide pointers
to where you can obtain information on ISPs via email, newsgroups, the
Web, and in print.</P
><p class="para">Readers who want basic information about the Internet can start by
reading a book about the Internet. My favorite is <em class="emphasis">The Whole
Internet Users' Guide and Catalog</EM
>, by Ed Krol (O'Reilly &amp;
Associates). It provides a user-oriented focus on the Internet
and a substantial list of ISPs.  Another book that provides a business
focus on &quot;getting connected&quot; is <em class="emphasis">Getting Connected: Establishing a
Presence on the Internet</EM
>, by Kevin Dowd (O'Reilly &amp; Associates).</P
><p class="para">If you can send email to the Internet, request information about the
ISPs in your area by sending email to
<a class="email" href="mailto:zahner@aimnet.com" title="zahner@aimnet.com">zahner@aimnet.com</A
> with the words &quot;MY AREA CODE =&quot; followed by your area
code in both the subject line and the body of the message. Here is an
example for mail sent from a Solaris system to inquire for service
providers for the 301 area code:</P

><p class="para">A good source of information about service providers is <em class="emphasis">The List</EM

from Mecklermedia, which is accessible on the Web at
<a class="systemitem.sitename" href="../../../../../../../thelist.iworld.com/">http://thelist.iworld.com</A

thousands of ISPs. The information is sorted into country code and
telephone area code lists to make it more useful.</P
><p class="para">Ask prospective ISPs about services as well as prices. Some ISPs
specialize in providing low-cost service to home users. They emphasize
price. However, if you are connecting a full network to the Internet,
you may want an ISP that can provide network address, name
service, Web services, and other features that your network might
need.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4079"></A
