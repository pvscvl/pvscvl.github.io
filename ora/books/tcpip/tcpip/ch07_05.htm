Reachability information is simply information about which networks can
be reached through a specific autonomous system.</P

protocol, and provides the following description of the routing
function of an autonomous system:
<blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">The classic definition of an Autonomous System is a set of routers<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8441"></A

under a single technical administration, using an interior gateway
protocol and common metrics to route packets within the AS, and using
an exterior gateway protocol to route packets to other ASs....
The administration of an AS appears to other ASs to have a single
coherent interior routing plan and presents a consistent picture of
what networks are reachable through it. From the standpoint of exterior
routing, an AS can be viewed as monolithic...</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>
Moving routing information into and out of these monoliths is the
function of exterior routing protocols. Exterior routing protocols are
also called exterior gateway protocols. Don't confuse <em class="emphasis">an</EM
>
exterior gateway protocol with <em class="emphasis">the</EM
> Exterior Gateway Protocol
(EGP). EGP is not a generic term; it is a particular exterior
routing protocol, and an old one at that.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="TCP2-CH-7-SECT-5.1">7.5.1 Exterior Gateway Protocol </A

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="TCP2-CH-7-IX-EXTERIOR-GATEWAY-PROTOCOL-EGP"></A
>A gateway running EGP announces that it can reach networks that are
part of its autonomous system. It does not announce that it can reach
networks outside its autonomous system. For example, the exterior
gateway for our imaginary autonomous system <em class="emphasis">nuts-as</EM
> can reach the
entire Internet through its external connection, but only one network
is contained in its autonomous system. Therefore, it would only
announce one network (172.16.0.0) if it ran EGP.</P
><p class="para">Before sending routing information, the systems first exchange EGP<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8453"></A
>
<em class="emphasis">Hello</EM
> and <em class="emphasis">I-Heard-You</EM
> (I-H-U) messages. These messages<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8458"></A
>
establish a dialog between two EGP gateways. Computers communicating
via EGP are called <em class="emphasis">EGP neighbors</EM
>, and the exchange of Hello and<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8461"></A
>
I-H-U messages is called <em class="emphasis">acquiring a neighbor</EM
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8465"></A
></P
><p class="para">Once a neighbor is acquired, routing information is requested via a<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8469"></A
>
<em class="emphasis">poll</EM
>. The neighbor responds by sending a packet of reachability
information called an <em class="emphasis">update</EM
>. The local system includes the<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8473"></A
>
routes from the update into its local routing table. If the neighbor
fails to respond to three consecutive polls, the system assumes that
the neighbor is down and removes the neighbor's routes from its table.
If the system receives a poll from its EGP neighbor, it responds with
its own update packet.</P
><p class="para">Unlike the interior protocols discussed above, EGP does not attempt to
choose the &quot;best&quot; route. EGP updates contain distance-vector information,
but EGP does not evaluate this information. The routing metrics from
different autonomous systems are not directly comparable. Each AS may
use different criteria for developing these values. Therefore, EGP leaves
the choice of a &quot;best&quot; route to someone else.</P
><p class="para">When EGP was designed, the network relied upon a group of trusted core
gateways to process and distribute the routes received from all of the
autonomous systems. These core gateways were expected to have the<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8477"></A
>
information necessary to choose the best external routes. EGP
reachability information was passed into the core gateways, where the
information was combined and passed back out to the autonomous
systems.</P
><p class="para">A routing structure that depends on a centrally controlled group of
gateways does not scale well and is therefore inadequate for the<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8480"></A
>
rapidly growing Internet. As the number of autonomous systems and<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8482"></A
>
networks connected to the Internet grew, it became
difficult for the core gateways to keep up with the expanding workload.
This is one reason why the Internet moved to a more distributed
architecture that places a share of the burden of processing routes on
each autonomous system. Another reason is that no central authority
controls the commercialized Internet. The Internet is composed of many
equal networks. In a distributed architecture, the autonomous systems<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8485"></A
>
require routing protocols, both interior and exterior, that can make
intelligent routing choices. Because of this, EGP is no longer popular.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8488"></A

><em class="emphasis">Border Gateway Protocol</EM
> (BGP) is the leading exterior routing
protocol of the Internet. It is based on the OSI <em class="emphasis">InterDomain Routing<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8496"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8498"></A
>
Protocol</EM
> (IDRP). BGP supports <em class="emphasis">policy-based routing</EM
>, which uses<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8501"></A
>
non-technical reasons (for example, political, organizational, or
security considerations) to make routing decisions. Thus BGP enhances
an autonomous system's ability to choose between routes and to implement
routing policies without relying on a central routing authority. This
feature is important in the absence of core gateways to perform these
tasks.</P
><p class="para">Routing policies are not part of the BGP protocol. Policies are
provided externally as configuration information. As described in
<a class="xref" href="ch02_01.htm" title="Delivering the Data">Chapter 2</A
>, the National Science Foundation provides Routing Arbiters<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8505"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8507"></A
>
(RAs) at the Network Access Points (NAPs) where large Internet Service<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8509"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8511"></A
>
Providers (ISPs) interconnect. The RAs can be queried for routing
policy information. Most ISPs also develop private policies based on
the bilateral agreements they have with other ISPs. BGP can be used to
implement these policies by controlling the routes it announces to
others and the routes it accepts from others. In the <b class="emphasis.bold">gated</B
>
section of this chapter we discuss the <b class="emphasis.bold">import</B
> command and the 
<b class="emphasis.bold">export</B
> command, which control what routes are accepted (import) 
and what routes are announced (export). The network administrator 
enforces the routing policy through configuring the router.</P
><p class="para">BGP is implemented on top of TCP, which provides BGP with a reliable
delivery service. BGP uses well-known TCP port 179. It acquires its
neighbors through the standard TCP three-way handshake. BGP neighbors are<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8518"></A
>
called <em class="emphasis">peers</EM
>. Once connected, BGP peers exchange OPEN messages to<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8522"></A
>
negotiate session parameters, such as the version of BGP that is to be
used.</P
><p class="para">The UPDATE message lists the destinations that can be reached through a<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8525"></A
>
specific path and the attributes of the path. BGP is a <em class="emphasis">path vector
protocol</EM
>. It is called a path vector protocol because it provides<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8528"></A
>
the entire end-to-end path of a route in the form of a sequence of<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8530"></A
>
autonomous system numbers. Having the complete AS path eliminates the
possibility of routing loops and count-to-infinity problems. A BGP
UPDATE contains a single path vector and all of the destinations
reachable through that path. Multiple UPDATE packets may be sent to
build a routing table.</P
><p class="para">BGP peers send each other complete routing table updates when the
connection is first established. After that, only changes are sent.
If there are no changes, just a small (19-byte) KEEPALIVE message is<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8534"></A
>
sent to indicate that the peer and the link are still operational. BGP
is very efficient in its use of network bandwidth and system
resources.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8536"></A
></P
><p class="para">By far the most important thing to remember about exterior protocols is
that most systems never run them. Exterior protocols are only required
when an AS must exchange routing information with another AS. Most
routers within an AS run an interior protocol such as OSPF. Only those
gateways that connect the AS to another AS need to run an exterior
routing protocol. Your network is probably an independent part of an AS
run by someone else. Internet Service Providers are good examples of
autonomous systems made up of many independent networks. Unless you
provide a similar level of service, you probably don't need to run an
exterior routing protocol.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8538"></A

></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8542"></A
>Although there are many routing protocols, choosing one
is usually easy. Most of the interior routing protocols mentioned
above were developed to handle the special routing problems of very
large networks. Some of the protocols have only been used by large
national and regional networks. For local area networks, RIP is still
the most common choice. For larger networks, OSPF is the
choice.</P
><p class="para">If you must run an exterior routing protocol, the protocol that you use
is often not a matter of choice. For two autonomous systems to exchange
routing information, they must use the same exterior protocol. If the
other AS is already in operation, its administrators have probably
decided which protocol to use, and you will be expected to conform to
their choice. Most often this choice is BGP.</P
><p class="para">The type of equipment affects the choice of protocols. Routers support
a wide range of protocols, though individual vendors may have a
preferred protocol. Hosts don't usually run routing protocols at all,
and most UNIX systems are delivered with only RIP. Allowing host<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8548"></A
>
systems to participate in dynamic routing could limit your choices.
<b class="emphasis.bold">gated</B
>, however, gives you the option to run many different
routing protocols on a UNIX system. While the performance of hardware
designed specifically to be a router is generally better,
<b class="emphasis.bold">gated</B
> gives you the option of using a UNIX system as a router.</P
><p class="para">In the following sections we discuss the Gateway Routing Daemon
(<b class="emphasis.bold">gated</B
>) software that combines interior and exterior routing
protocols into one software package. We look at examples of running RIP,
RIPv2, OSPF, and BGP with <b class="emphasis.bold">gated</B
