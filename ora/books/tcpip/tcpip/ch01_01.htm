><p class="para">All of us who use a UNIX desktop system&nbsp;- engineers, educators, scientists,
and business people&nbsp;- have second careers as UNIX system administrators.
Networking these computers gives us new tasks as network administrators.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-220"></A
>Network administration and system administration are two different jobs.
System administration tasks such as adding users and doing backups
are isolated to one independent computer system. Not so with network
administration. Once you place your computer on a network, it interacts
with many other systems. The way you do network administration tasks
has effects, good and bad, not only on your system but on other systems
on the network. A sound understanding of basic network administration
benefits everyone.</P
><p class="para">Networking computers dramatically enhances their ability to 
communicate&nbsp;- and most computers are used more for communication 
than computation. Many mainframes and supercomputers are busy crunching the numbers for
business and science, but the number of such systems pales in comparison
to the millions of systems busy moving mail to a remote colleague or
retrieving information from a remote repository. Further, when you think
of the hundreds of millions of desktop systems that are used primarily for preparing documents to communicate ideas from one person to another, it
is easy to see why most computers can be viewed as communications devices.</P
><p class="para">The positive impact of computer communications increases with the number
and type of computers that participate in the network. One of the great<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-226"></A
>
benefits of TCP/IP is that it provides interoperable communications
between all types of hardware and all kinds of operating systems.</P
><p class="para">This book is a practical, step-by-step guide to configuring and
managing TCP/IP networking software on UNIX computer systems. TCP/IP
is the software package that dominates UNIX data<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-230"></A

communications. It is the
leading communications software for UNIX local area networks and enterprise
intranets, and for the foundation of the worldwide Internet.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-233"></A
>The name &quot;TCP/IP&quot; refers to an entire suite of data communications
protocols. The suite gets its name from two of the protocols that
belong to it: the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet
Protocol. Although there are many other protocols in the suite,  
TCP and IP are certainly two of the most
important.</P
><p class="para">The first part of this book discusses the basics of TCP/IP and how it
moves data across a network. The second part explains how to configure
and run TCP/IP on a UNIX system. Let's start with a little history.</P

>In 1969 the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funded a
research and development project to create an experimental packet-switching network. This network, called the <em class="emphasis">ARPANET</EM
>, was built
to study techniques for providing robust, reliable, vendor-independent
data communications. Many techniques of modern data communications
were developed in the ARPANET.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="TCP2-CH-1-IX-INTERNET-MILITARY-ORIGINS-OF"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="TCP2-CH-1-IX-ARPANET"></A
>The experimental ARPANET was so successful that many of the
organizations attached to it began to use it for daily data
communications. In 1975 the ARPANET was converted from an experimental
network to an operational network, and the responsibility for
administering the network was given to the Defense Communications<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-250"></A
>
Agency (DCA).
[1]
However, development of the ARPANET did not stop just
because it was being used as an operational network; the basic TCP/IP
protocols were developed after the ARPANET was operational.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[1] DCA has since changed its name to Defense Information Systems Agency
(DISA).</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">The TCP/IP protocols were adopted as Military Standards (MIL STD) in
1983, and all hosts connected to the network were required to convert
to the new protocols. To ease this conversion, DARPA
[2]
funded Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) to implement TCP/IP in Berkeley (BSD) UNIX.
Thus began the marriage of UNIX and TCP/IP.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[2] During the 1980s and early 1990s, ARPA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Defense, was named Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA). Currently known as ARPA, the agency is again preparing to change
its name to DARPA. Whether it is known as ARPA or DARPA, the agency and
its mission of funding advanced research has remained the same.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><p class="para">About the time that TCP/IP was adopted as a standard, the term <em class="emphasis">Internet</EM

came into common usage. In 1983, the old ARPANET was divided into
MILNET, the unclassified part of the Defense Data Network (DDN), and a
new, smaller ARPANET. &quot;Internet&quot; was used to refer to the entire
network: MILNET plus ARPANET.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-259"></A

>In 1985 the National Science Foundation (NSF) created NSFNet and<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-265"></A
>
connected it to the then-existing Internet. The original NSFNet linked
together the five NSF supercomputer centers. It was smaller than the
ARPANET and no faster&nbsp;- 56Kbps. Nonetheless, the creation of the
NSFNet was a significant event in the history of the Internet because
NSF brought with it a new vision of the use of the Internet. NSF
wanted to extend the network to every scientist and engineer in the
United States. To accomplish this, in 1987 NSF created a new, faster backbone
and a three-tiered network topology that included the
backbone, regional networks, and local networks.</P
><p class="para">In 1990, the ARPANET formally passed out of existence, and the NSFNet
ceased its role as a primary Internet backbone network in 1995. Still,
today the Internet is larger than ever and encompasses more than 95,000
networks worldwide. This network of networks is linked together
in the United States at several major interconnection points:<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-268"></A

>The Internet has grown far beyond its original scope. The original
networks and agencies that built the Internet no longer play an
essential role for the current network. The Internet has evolved from
a simple backbone network, through a three-tiered hierarchical
structure, to a huge network of interconnected, distributed network
hubs. It has grown exponentially since 1983&nbsp;- doubling in
size every year. Through all of this incredible change one thing has
remained constant: the Internet is built on the TCP/IP protocol
suite.</P
><p class="para">A sign of the network's success is the confusion that
surrounds the term <em class="emphasis">internet</EM
>. Originally it was used
only as the name of the network built upon the Internet Protocol. Now
<em class="emphasis">internet</EM
> is a generic term used to refer to an entire class
of networks. An internet (lowercase &quot;i&quot;) is any collection
of separate physical networks, interconnected by a common protocol, to
form a single logical network. The Internet (uppercase &quot;I&quot;)
is the worldwide collection of interconnected networks, which grew out
of the original ARPANET,  that uses <em class="emphasis">Internet Protocol</EM
> (IP) to
link the various physical networks into a single logical network. In
this book, both &quot;internet&quot; and &quot;Internet&quot; refer to
networks that are interconnected by TCP/IP.</P
><p class="para">Because TCP/IP is required for Internet connection, the growth of the
Internet has spurred interest in TCP/IP. As more organizations become
familiar with TCP/IP, they see that its power can be applied in other
network applications. The Internet protocols are often used for local
area networking, even when the local network is not connected to the
Internet. TCP/IP is also widely used to build enterprise networks.
TCP/IP-based enterprise networks that use Internet techniques and
World Wide Web tools to disseminate internal corporate
information are called <em class="emphasis">intranets</EM
>.  TCP/IP is the foundation of all
of these varied networks.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-300"></A

>The popularity of the TCP/IP protocols did not grow rapidly just
because the protocols were there, or because connecting to the Internet
mandated their use. They met an important need (worldwide data
communication) at the right time, and they had several important
features that allowed them to meet this need. These features are:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Open protocol standards, freely available and developed independently
from any specific computer hardware or operating system. Because it is
so widely supported, TCP/IP is ideal for uniting different hardware and

>Protocols are formal rules of behavior. In international relations,
protocols minimize the problems caused by cultural differences when
various nations work together. By agreeing to a common set of rules
that are widely known and independent of any nation's customs,
diplomatic protocols minimize misunderstandings; everyone knows how to
act and how to interpret the actions of others.  Similarly, when
computers communicate, it is necessary to define a set of rules to
govern their communications.</P
><p class="para">In data communications these sets of rules are also called
<em class="emphasis">protocols</EM
>. In homogeneous networks, a single computer vendor
specifies a set of communications rules designed to use 
the strengths of the vendor's operating system and hardware
architecture. But homogeneous networks are like the culture of a
single country&nbsp;- only the natives are truly at home in it. TCP/IP
attempts to create a heterogeneous network<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-331"></A
>
with open protocols that 
are independent of operating system and architectural differences.
TCP/IP protocols are available to everyone, and are developed and
changed by consensus&nbsp;- not by the fiat of one manufacturer. Everyone
is free to develop products to meet these open protocol
specifications.</P
><p class="para">The open nature of TCP/IP protocols requires
publicly available standards documents. All protocols in
the TCP/IP protocol suite are defined in one of three Internet
standards publications. A number of the protocols have been adopted as
<em class="emphasis">Military Standards</EM
> (MIL STD). Others were published as
<em class="emphasis">Internet Engineering Notes</EM
> (IEN)&nbsp;- though the IEN form of
publication has now been abandoned. But most information about TCP/IP
protocols is published as <em class="emphasis">Requests for Comments</EM
> (RFCs).<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-338"></A
>
RFCs contain the latest versions of the specifications of all standard
TCP/IP protocols.
[3]
As the title &quot;Request for Comments&quot; implies, the
style and content of these documents is much less rigid than most
standards documents. RFCs contain a wide range of interesting and
useful information, and are not limited to the formal specification of
data communications protocols.</P

RFCs yourself. Some contain practical advice and guidance
