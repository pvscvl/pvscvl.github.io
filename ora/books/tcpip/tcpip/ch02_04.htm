><a class="indexterm" name="TCP2-CH-2-IX-INTERNET-ROUTING-ARCHITECTURE"></A

described the evolution of the Internet architecture over the
years. Along with these architectural changes have come changes in the
way that routing information is disseminated within the network.</P
><p class="para">In the original Internet structure, there was a hierarchy of
gateways. This hierarchy reflected the fact that the Internet was
built upon the existing ARPANET.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1833"></A
>
When the Internet was created, the ARPANET was the backbone of the
network: a central delivery medium to carry long-distance
traffic. This central system was called the <em class="emphasis">core</EM
>, and the
centrally managed gateways that interconnected it were called the
<em class="emphasis">core gateways</EM
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1837"></A
></P
><p class="para">In that hierarchical structure, routing information about all of the
networks in the Internet was passed into the core gateways. The core
gateways processed the information, and then exchanged it among
themselves using the <em class="emphasis">Gateway to Gateway Protocol</EM
> (GGP).<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1841"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1843"></A
>
The processed routing information was then passed back out to the
external gateways. The core gateways maintained accurate routing
information for the entire Internet.</P
><p class="para">Using the hierarchical core router model to distribute routing
information has a major weakness: every route must be processed by the
core. This places a tremendous processing burden on the core, and as
the Internet grew larger the burden increased. In network-speak, we
say that this routing model does not &quot;scale well.&quot;<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1846"></A
>
For this reason, a new model emerged.</P
><p class="para">Even in the days of a single Internet, core groups of independent
networks called <em class="emphasis">autonomous systems</EM
> (AS)<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1850"></A
>
existed outside of the core. The term &quot;autonomous system&quot; has a formal
meaning in TCP/IP routing. An autonomous system is not merely an
independent network. It is a collection of networks and gateways with
its own internal mechanism for collecting routing information and
passing it to other independent network systems. The routing
information passed to the other network systems is called
<em class="emphasis">reachability information</EM
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1853"></A
>
Reachability information simply says which networks can be reached
through that autonomous system.  The <em class="emphasis">Exterior Gateway Protocol</EM
>
(EGP)<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1856"></A
>
was the protocol used to pass reachability information between
autonomous systems and into the core (see

><h4 class="figure"><a class="title" name="TCP2-CH-2-FIG-2">Figure 2.3: Gateway hierarchy</A
></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/tcp2_0203.gif" alt="Figure 2.3"><p class="para">The new routing model is based on co-equal collections of autonomous
systems, called <em class="emphasis">routing</EM
> <em class="emphasis">domains</EM
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1865"></A
>
Routing domains exchange
routing information with other domains using <em class="emphasis">Border Gateway Protocol</EM
>
(BGP).<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1869"></A
>
Each routing domain processes the information it receives from other
domains. Unlike the hierarchical model, this model does not depend on
a single core system to choose the &quot;best&quot; routes. Each routing domain
does this processing for itself; therefore, this model is more
expandable.
<a class="xref" href="#TCP2-CH-2-FIG-3" title="Routing domains">Figure 2.4</A
>
represents this model with three intersecting
circles. Each circle is a routing domain. The overlapping areas are
border areas, where routing information is shared. The domains share
information, but do not rely on any one system to provide all routing
information.</P

></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/tcp2_0204.gif" alt="Figure 2.4"><p class="para">The problem with this model is: how are &quot;best&quot; routes determined in a
global network if there is no central routing authority, like the core,
that is trusted to determine the &quot;best&quot; routes? In the days of the
NSFNET,<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1876"></A
>
the <em class="emphasis">policy routing database</EM
> (PRDB)<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1879"></A
>
was used to determine whether the reachability information advertised
by an autonomous system was valid. But now, even the NSFNET does not
play a central role.</P
><p class="para">To fill this void, NSF created the <em class="emphasis">Routing Arbiter</EM
> (RA)<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1884"></A
>
servers when it created the <em class="emphasis">Network Access Points</EM
> (NAPs)<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1887"></A
>
that replaced the role of the NSFNET. A route arbiter is located at
each NAP. The server provides access to the <em class="emphasis">Routing Arbiter
Database</EM
> (RADB),<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1890"></A
>
which replaced the PRDB. Internet Service Providers can query
servers to validate the reachability information advertised by an
autonomous system.</P
><p class="para">Many ISPs do not use the route servers. Instead they depend on formal
and informal bilateral agreements.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1893"></A
>
In essence, two ISPs get together and decide what reachability
information each will accept from the other.  They create, in effect,
local routing policies. This is a slow manual process that probably
will not be flexible enough for a rapidly growing Internet.</P
><p class="para">The RADB is only part of the <em class="emphasis">Internet Routing Registry</EM
> (IRR).<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1897"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1899"></A
>
As befits a distributed routing architecture, there are multiple
organizations that validate and register routing
information. Europeans were the pioneers in this. The Reseaux IP
Europeens (RIPE) Network Control Center (NCC)<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1901"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1903"></A
>
provides the routing
registry for European IP networks. Big network carriers, like MCI and
ANS, provide registries for their customers. All of the registries
share a common format based on the RIPE-181 standard.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1905"></A
></P
><p class="para">Creating an effective routing architecture continues to be a major
challenge for the Internet that will certainly evolve over time.
No matter how it is derived, eventually the routing information winds up
in your local gateway, where it is used by IP to make routing
decisions.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-1908"></A
