>The <b class="emphasis.bold">ping</B
> command tests whether a remote host can be
reached from your computer. This simple function is extremely useful
for testing the network connection, independent of the application in
which the original problem was detected. <b class="emphasis.bold">ping</B
> allows you to
determine whether further testing should be directed toward
the network connection (the lower layers) or the application (the upper
layers). If <b class="emphasis.bold">ping</B
> shows that packets can travel to the remote
system and back, the user's problem is probably in the upper layers.
If packets can't make the round trip, lower protocol layers are
probably at fault.</P
><p class="para">Frequently a user reports a network problem by stating that he can't
<b class="emphasis.bold">telnet</B
> (or <b class="emphasis.bold">ftp</B
>, or send email, or whatever) 
to some remote host. He then immediately qualifies this
statement with the announcement that it worked before. In cases like
this, where the ability to connect to the remote host is in question,
<b class="emphasis.bold">ping</B
> is a very useful tool.</P
><p class="para">Using the hostname provided by the user, <b class="emphasis.bold">ping</B

If your <b class="emphasis.bold">ping</B

If the user's <b class="emphasis.bold">ping</B
> is also successful, concentrate your further
analysis on the specific application that the user is having trouble
with. Perhaps the user is attempting to <b class="emphasis.bold">telnet</B
> to a host that
only provides anonymous <b class="emphasis.bold">ftp</B
>. Perhaps the host was down when the
user tried his application. Have the user try it again, while you
watch or listen to every detail of what he is doing. If he is doing
everything right and the application still fails, detailed analysis of<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15431"></A

><p class="para">If your <b class="emphasis.bold">ping</B

those things that are different about the user's path to the remote
host, when compared to your path to the remote host.</P

attention to any error messages. The error messages displayed by

address. The name servers could be at fault (either your local server
or the remote system's server), the name could be incorrect, or
something could be wrong with the network between your system and the
remote server. If you know the remote host's IP address, try to
<b class="emphasis.bold">ping</B

the network hardware. On an Ethernet the problem could be improper
cable termination, a bad cable segment, or a bad piece of &quot;active&quot;
hardware, such as a hub, switch, or transceiver. Check the cable with a<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15588"></A

cable tester as described earlier. Good hubs and switches often have<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-15590"></A
