>A firewall system is a popular way to provide network security.  The
term &quot;firewall&quot; implies protection from danger, and just as the
firewall in your car protects the passengers' compartment from the
car's engine, a firewall computer system protects your network from
the outside world. A firewall computer provides strict access control
between your systems and the outside world.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18389"></A
>The concept of a firewall is quite simple. A firewall is a choke point
through which all traffic between a secured network and an unsecured
network must pass. In practice, it is usually a choke point between an
enterprise network and the Internet. Creating a single point through
which all traffic must pass allows the traffic to be more easily
monitored and controlled and allows security expertise to be
concentrated on that single point.</P
><p class="para">Firewalls are implemented in many ways. In fact, there are so many
different types of firewalls, the term is almost meaningless.  When
someone tells you they have a firewall you really can't know exactly
what they mean. Covering all of the different types of firewall
architectures requires an entire book&nbsp;- see <em class="emphasis">Building Internet
Firewalls</EM
> (O'Reilly &amp; Associates). Here we cover the screened
subnet architecture (probably the most popular firewall architecture),
and the multi-homed host architecture, which is essentially a
firewall-in-a-box.</P
><p class="para">The most common firewall architecture contains at least four hardware
components: an exterior router, a secure server (called a Bastion Host),<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18395"></A
>
an exposed network (called a Perimeter Network),<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18397"></A
>
and an interior router.
Each hardware component provides part of the complete security scheme.
<a class="xref" href="#TCP2-CH-12-FIG-3" title="Screened subnet firewall">Figure 12.4</A
>
illustrates this architecture.</P

></H4
><img class="graphic" src="figs/tcp2_1204.gif" alt="Figure 12.4"><p class="para">The exterior router is the only connection between the enterprise network
and the outside world. This router is configured to do a minimal level
of access control. It checks to make sure that no packet coming from the
external world has a source address that matches the internal network.
If our network number is 172.16, the exterior router discards any
packets it receives on its exterior interface that contain the source
address 172.16. That source address should only be received by the
router on its interior interface. Security people call this type of
access control <em class="emphasis">packet filtering</EM
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18405"></A
>
In some ways it is similar to
the packet filtering we did in <a class="xref" href="ch11_01.htm" title="Troubleshooting TCP/IP ">Chapter 11, <cite class="chapter">Troubleshooting TCP/IP </CITE
></A
> because packets are &quot;filtered
out&quot; based on IP header information.</P
><p class="para">The interior router<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18411"></A
>
does the bulk of the access control work. It
filters packets not only on address but also on protocol and port
numbers to control the services that are accessible to and from the
interior network. What services are blocked by this router are up to
you. If you plan to use a firewall, the services that will be allowed
and those that will be denied should be defined in your security policy
document. Almost every service can be a threat. These threats
must be evaluated in light of your security needs. Services that are
intended only for internal users (NIS, NFS, X-Windows, etc.) are almost
always blocked. Services that allow writing to internal systems (the <b class="emphasis.bold">r</B
>
commands, telnet, FTP, SMTP, etc.) are usually blocked. Services that
provide information about internal systems (DNS, fingerd, etc.) are
usually blocked. This doesn't leave much running! That is where the
bastion host and perimeter network come in.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18416"></A
>The bastion host is a secure server. It provides an interconnection
point between the enterprise network and the outside world for the
restricted services. Some of the services that are restricted by the
interior gateway may be essential for a useful network. Those essential
services are provided through the bastion host in a secure manner.
The bastion host provides some services directly, such as DNS,
SMTP mail services, and anonymous FTP. Other services are provided as<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18418"></A
>
<em class="emphasis">proxy services</EM
>. When the bastion host acts as a proxy server,
internal clients connect to the outside through the bastion hosts and
external systems respond back to the internal clients through the host.
The bastion host can therefore control the traffic flowing into and out
of the site to any extent desired.</P
><p class="para">There can be more than one secure server, and there often is.
The perimeter network connects the servers together and connects the
exterior router to the interior router. The systems on the perimeter
network are much more exposed to security threats than are the systems
on the interior network. This is as it must be. After all, the secure
servers are needed to provide service to the outside world as well as
to the internal network. Isolating the systems that must be exposed
on a separate network lessens the chance that a compromise of one of
those systems will lead directly to the compromise of an internal system.</P
><p class="para">The multi-homed host architecture<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18423"></A
>
attempts to duplicate all of these
firewall functions in a single box. It works by replacing an IP router
with a multi-homed host that does not forward packets at the IP layer.
[8]
The multi-homed host effectively severs the connection between the
interior and exterior networks. To provide the interior network with
some level of network connectivity, it performs similar functions to
the bastion hosts.</P

><p class="para"><a class="xref" href="#TCP2-CH-12-FIG-4" title="Firewalls versus routers">Figure 12.5</A

shows a comparison between an IP router and a multi-homed
host firewall. A router handles packets up through the IP layer. The
router forwards each packet based on the packet's destination address,
and the route to that destination indicated in the routing table. A
host, on the other hand, does not forward packets. The multi-homed
host processes packets through the Application Layer, which provides it
with complete control over how packets are handled.

>This definition of a firewall&nbsp;- as a device completely distinct from an
IP router&nbsp;- is not universally accepted. Some people refer to routers
with special security features as firewalls, but this is really just
a matter of semantics. In this book, routers with special security
features are called &quot;secure routers&quot; or &quot;secure gateways.&quot; Firewalls,
while they may include routers, do more than just filter packets.</P

>An intruder cannot mount a direct attack on
any of the systems behind a firewall. Packets destined for hosts
behind the firewall are simply delivered to the firewall. The intruder
must instead mount an attack directly against the firewall machine.
Because the firewall machine can be the target of break-in attacks,
it employs very strict security guidelines. But because there is only
one firewall versus many machines on the local network, it is
easier to enforce strict security on the firewall.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18448"></A
>The disadvantage of a firewall system is obvious. In the same manner
that it restricts access from the outside into the local network, it
restricts access from the local network to the outside world. To
minimize the inconvenience caused by the firewall, the system must do
many more things than a router does. Some firewalls provide:</P

><p class="para">Only the minimal services truly needed to communicate with external
systems should be provided on a firewall system. Other common network
services (NIS, NFS, <b class="emphasis.bold">rsh</B
>, <b class="emphasis.bold">rcp</B
>, <b class="emphasis.bold">finger</B
>, etc.) should
generally not be provided. Services are limited to decrease the number
of holes through which an intruder can gain access. On firewall systems,
security is more important than service.</P
><p class="para">The biggest problems for the firewall machine are <b class="emphasis.bold">ftp</B
> <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18464"></A
>
service and remote terminal service.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18467"></A
>
To maintain a high level of security, user
accounts are discouraged on the firewall machine; however,
user data must pass through the firewall system for <b class="emphasis.bold">ftp</B
> and
remote terminal services. This problem can be handled by creating
special user accounts for <b class="emphasis.bold">ftp</B
> and <b class="emphasis.bold">telnet</B
> that are
shared by all internal users. But group accounts are generally viewed
as security problems. A better solution is to provide proxy services<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18474"></A
>
on the firewall. To do this you need to run a proxy server on the
firewall and proxy clients on your internal system. Most commercial
client software includes support for proxy services. Many packages are
compatible with SOCKS,<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18477"></A
>
a freely available proxy service package that
can be downloaded from the Internet.</P
><p class="para">Because to be effective a firewall must be constructed with great care,
and because there are many configuration variables for setting up a
firewall machine, vendors offer special firewall software. Some vendors
sell special-purpose machines designed specifically for use as firewall
systems. Before setting up your own firewall, investigate the options
available from your hardware vendor.</P
><p class="para">The details of setting up a firewall system are beyond the scope of this
book. Before you proceed, I recommend you read <em class="emphasis">Building Internet
Firewalls</EM
> and <em class="emphasis">Firewalls and Internet Security</EM
>, listed in
the bibliography at the end of this chapter. Unless you have skilled
UNIX systems administrators with adequate free time, a do-it-yourself
firewall<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18483"></A

installation is a mistake. Hire a company that specializes
in firewall design and installation. If your information is valuable
enough to protect with a firewall, it must be valuable enough to protect
with a professionally installed firewall.</P
><p class="para">Firewall systems are useful to many sites, but for some others they
are not appropriate. The restrictions they place on individual
users are not acceptable to some organizations, and these restrictions
can drive independent-minded users to find other ways to handle their
communications needs. Think seriously about your real security needs
before selecting a solution.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18487"></A

><p class="para">As we discussed in the chapters on routing and troubleshooting, it is
necessary for your system to have a routing table entry for every
network with which it will communicate. This can be either an explicit
route for an individual network, or a default route for all networks.
Without the proper routes, your system cannot communicate with remote
networks, and the remote networks cannot communicate with your system.
Regardless of how the remote site sets up its routing, it cannot
communicate with your host if your host does not have a route back to
the remote site. Because of this, you can control which remote sites
are able to communicate with your system by controlling the contents of
the routing table.</P

><p class="para">This security technique is less restrictive than an internal firewall,
because it affects only the systems that contain the data or processes
that are being protected. This technique is easy to implement and does
not require special equipment or software. However, it is also much
less secure than a firewall. If any of these systems is successfully
attacked, all of the systems could be compromised. Each system being
protected this way must be properly configured, while one firewall can
protect a group of systems. This works only when there are a small
number of systems and they are all under the control of a single
network administrator. In a few situations, this is a possible
alternative to an internal firewall..<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18525"></A
