><p class="para">Three services that are used on many networks are file servers, print
servers, and mail servers. The purpose of these services and the
protocols they are built on is discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="Network Services">Chapter 3</A
>. In this section
we investigate what information must be passed to the users so that the
client systems can be successfully configured, and how the network
administrator determines that information.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="TCP2-CH-4-SECT-5.0.1">4.5.1 File servers </A

><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4571"></A
>At a minimum the user needs to know the hostnames of the network file
servers. Using the names and the <b class="emphasis.bold">showmount</B

the user can
determine what filesystems are being offer by the servers and who is
permitted to use those filesystems.

Without at least the hostname, the user would have to guess which
system offered file service.</P

><p class="para">A better approach is to give users information that also includes what
filesystems are being offered and who should use those filesystems.
For example, if the UNIX <b class="emphasis.bold">man</B

server, the users should be informed not to install the <b class="emphasis.bold">man</B

on their local disk drives and they should be told exactly how to access
the centrally supported files.</P

Printer security may also require that the user be given a
username and password to access the printer.</P
><p class="para">This is the only information needed to configure the client. However,
you probably will want to provide your users with additional information
about the features, location and administration of shared printers.</P

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="TCP2-CH-4-SECT-5.1">4.5.3 Planning Your Mail System </A
></H3
><p class="para">TCP/IP provides the tools you need to create a reliable, flexible
electronic mail system. Servers are one of the tools that improve
reliability. It is possible to create a peer-to-peer email network in
which every end system directly sends and receives its own mail.
However, relying on every system to deliver and collect the mail
requires that every system be properly administered and consistently 
up and running. This isn't practical, because many small systems are
offline for large portions of the day. Most networks use servers so that
only a few systems need to be properly configured and operational for
the mail to go through.</P
><p class="para">The terminology that describes email servers is confusing because all
of the server functions usually occur in one computer, and all of the
terms are used interchangeably to refer to that system. In this text
we differentiate between these functions, but we expect you will do all
of these tasks on one UNIX system running <b class="emphasis.bold">sendmail</B
>.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4601"></A
>
We use these
terms in the following manner:<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4603"></A

><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Mail server</EM

><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">The mail server collects incoming mail for other computers on the
network. It supports interactive logins<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4612"></A

as well as POP or IMAP so that
users can read their mail as they see fit.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Mail relay</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4620"></A
>A mail relay is a host that forwards mail between internal systems and
from internal systems to remote hosts. Mail relays allow internal
systems to have simple mail configurations because only the relay host
needs to have software to handle special mail addressing schemes and
aliases.</P

><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Mail gateway</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4628"></A
>A mail gateway is a system that forwards email between dissimilar
systems. You don't need a gateway to go from one Internet host to
another because both systems use SMTP. You do need a gateway to go
from SMTP to X.400 or to a proprietary mailer. In a pure TCP/IP
network, this function is not needed.</P
></DD
></DL
><p class="para">The mail server is the most important component of a reliable system
because it eliminates reliance on the user's system. A centrally
controlled, professionally operated server collects the mail regardless
of whether or not the end system is operational.</P
><p class="para">The relay host also contributes to the reliability of the email
system. If mail cannot be immediately delivered by the relay host, it
is queued and processed later. An end system also queues mail, but if
it is shut down no attempts can be made to deliver queued mail until
the system is back online. The mail server and the mail relay are
operated 24 hours a day.</P
><p class="para">The design of most TCP/IP email networks is based on the following
guidelines:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Use a mail server to collect mail, and POP<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4637"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4639"></A

or IMAP to deliver the mail.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Use a mail relay host to forward mail. Implement a simplified email 
address scheme on the relay host.</P

and SMTP.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4650"></A

Users who insist on using a proprietary
email system should be responsible for obtaining and configuring an
SMTP mail gateway for that system in order to connect to your TCP/IP
email network.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Standardize on MIME<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-4655"></A

attachment schemes; they just cause confusion when the users of Brand X
email cannot read attachments received from Brand Y.</P

><p class="para">For their client configurations, provide the users with the hostname
and IP address of the mail server and the mail
relay. The mail server will also require a username and password for
each person.</P
