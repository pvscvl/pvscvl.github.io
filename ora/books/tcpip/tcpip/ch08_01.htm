><p class="para">Congratulations! You have installed TCP/IP in the kernel, configured
the network interface, and configured routing. At this point, you have
completed all of the configuration tasks required to run TCP/IP on a
UNIX system. While none of the remaining tasks are <em class="emphasis">required</EM

TCP/IP software to operate, they are necessary for making the network
more friendly and useful.
In the next two chapters, we look at how to
configure basic TCP/IP network services. Perhaps the most important of
these is name service.</P
><p class="para">Strictly speaking, name service<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9193"></A

is not necessary for computers to communicate. It is, as the name
implies, a service&nbsp;- specifically, a service intended to make the
network more user-friendly. Computers are perfectly happy with IP
addresses, but people prefer names. The importance of name service is
indicated by the amount of coverage it has in this
book. <a class="xref" href="ch03_01.htm" title="Network Services">Chapter 3, <cite class="chapter">Network Services</CITE

defined in a BIND configuration are resolver-only systems, caching-only
servers, primary servers, and secondary servers.</P
><p class="para">The resolver is the code that asks nameservers for domain information.
On UNIX systems, it is implemented as a library, rather than a separate
client program. Some systems, called resolver-only systems, use only
the resolver; they don't run a nameserver. Resolver-only systems are<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9249"></A

><p class="para">Configuring a primary server requires creating a complete set of
configuration files: zone files for the regular domain and the reverse

A secondary server keeps a complete copy of all domain information,
and can answer queries about that domain with authority. Therefore, a
secondary server is also considered a master server.</P
><p class="para">Configuring a secondary server does not require creating local zone
files, because the zone files are downloaded from the primary server.

are required.</P

><dd class="listitem"><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9295"></A
>A caching-only server runs the nameserver software, but keeps no
nameserver database files. It learns the answer to every nameserver
query from some remote server. Once it learns an answer, the server
caches the answer and uses it to answer future queries for the same
information. All nameservers use cached information in this manner,
but a caching-only server depends on this technique for all of its
nameserver information. It is not considered an authoritative (or
master) server, because all of the information it provides is
secondhand.
Only a boot file and a cache file are required for a caching-only
configuration. But the most common configuration also includes a
loopback file. <a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9297"></A

This is probably the most common nameserver
configuration, and apart from the resolver-only configuration, it is<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9300"></A

the easiest to configure.</P

><p class="para">A server may be any one of these configurations or, as is often the
case, it may combine elements of more than one type of configuration.
However, all systems run the resolver, so let's begin by examining the
configuration of the client side of the DNS software.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9303"></A
