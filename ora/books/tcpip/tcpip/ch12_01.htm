><p class="para">Hosts attached to a network&nbsp;- particularly the worldwide Internet&nbsp;- are
exposed to a wider range of security threats than are unconnected hosts.
Network security reduces the risks of connecting to a network. But by<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16830"></A
>
nature, network access and computer security work at cross-purposes. A network is a data highway designed to increase access to
computer systems, while security is designed to control access.
Providing network security is a balancing act between open access and
security.</P
><p class="para">The highway analogy is very appropriate. Like a highway, the network
provides equal access for all&nbsp;- welcome visitors as well as unwelcome
intruders. At home, you provide security for your possessions by
locking your house, not by blocking the streets. Likewise, network
security generally means providing adequate security on individual host
computers, not providing security directly on the network.</P
><p class="para">In very small towns, where people know each other, doors are often left
unlocked. But in big cities, doors have deadbolts and chains. In the
last decade, the Internet has grown from a small town of a few thousand
users to a big city of millions of users. Just as the anonymity of a
big city turns neighbors into strangers, the growth of the Internet has
reduced the level of trust<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16836"></A
>
between network neighbors. The ever-increasing need for computer security is an unfortunate side effect.
Growth, however, is not all bad. In the same way that a big city
offers more choices and more services, the expanded network provides
increased services. For most of us, security consciousness is a small
price to pay for network access.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16839"></A
>Network break-ins have increased as the network has grown and become
more impersonal, but it is easy to exaggerate the extent of these security breaches. Over-reacting to the threat of break-ins may hinder the
way you use the network. Don't make the cure worse than the disease.
The best advice about network security is
to use common sense.
RFC 1244, <em class="emphasis">Site Security Handbook</EM
>, by Holbrook, Reynold, et al.,
states this principle very well:
<blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="para">Common sense is the most appropriate tool that can be used to establish
your security policy. Elaborate security schemes and mechanisms are
impressive, and they do have their place, yet there is little point in
investing money and time on an elaborate implementation scheme if the
simple controls are forgotten.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE

This chapter emphasizes the simple controls that can be used to
increase your network's security. A reasonable approach to security,
based on the level of security required by your system, is the most
cost-effective&nbsp;- both in terms of actual expense and in terms of
productivity.</P

></H2
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="TCP2-CH-12-IX-SECURITY-PLANNING"></A
>One of the most important network security tasks, and probably one of
the least enjoyable, is developing a network security policy.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16851"></A
>
Most computer people want a technical solution to every problem. We want to
find a program that &quot;fixes&quot; the network security problem. Few of us
want to write a paper on network security policies and procedures.
However, a well-thought-out security plan will help you decide what
needs to be protected, how much you are willing to invest in protecting
it, and who will be responsible for carrying out the steps to protect
it.</P
><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="TCP2-CH-12-SECT-1.1">12.1.1 Assessing the Threat </A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="TCP2-CH-12-IX-THREAT-ASSESSING"></A
>The first step toward developing an effective network security plan is
to assess the threat that connection presents to your systems. RFC 1244
identifies three distinct types of security threats usually associated
with network connectivity:</P
><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Unauthorized access</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">A break-in by an unauthorized person.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Disclosure of information</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Any problem that causes the disclosure of valuable or sensitive
information to people who should not have access to the information.</P
></DD
><dt class="term"><em class="emphasis">Denial of service</EM
></DT
><dd class="listitem"><p class="para">Any problem that makes it difficult or impossible for the system to
continue to perform productive work.</P
></DD
></DL
><p class="para">Assess these threats in relation to the number of users who would be
affected, as well as to the sensitivity of the information that might
be compromised. For some organizations, break-ins are an embarrassment
that can undermine the confidence that others have in the organization. Intruders tend to target government and academic organizations that
will be embarrassed by the break-in. But for most
organizations, unauthorized access is not a major problem unless it
involves one of the other threats: disclosure of information or denial
of service.</P
><p class="para">Assessing the threat of information disclosure<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16877"></A
>
depends on the type of
information that could be compromised. While no system with highly
classified information should ever be directly connected to the
Internet, systems with other types of sensitive information might be connected without undue hazard. In most cases, files such as personnel and medical records, corporate plans, and credit reports can be adequately protected
by standard UNIX file security procedures. However, if the
risk of liability in case of disclosure is great, the host may choose not to be connected to the Internet.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16880"></A
>Denial of service can be a severe problem if it impacts many users or a
major mission of your organization. Some systems can be connected to
the network with little concern. The benefit of connecting individual
workstations and small servers to the Internet generally outweighs the
chance of having service interrupted for the individuals and small
groups served by these systems. Other systems may be vital to the
survival of your organization. The threat of losing the services of a
mission-critical system must be evaluated seriously before connecting
such a system to the network.</P
><p class="para">In his class on computer security, Brent Chapman<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16883"></A
>
classifies information security threats into three categories: threats to the secrecy, availability, and integrity of data. Secrecy<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16885"></A
>
is the need
to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information. Availability means
that you want information and information processing resources available
when they are needed; a denial-of-service attack disrupts availability.
The need for the integrity of information is equally obvious, but its
link to computer security is more subtle. Once someone has gained
unauthorized access to a system, the integrity of the information on<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16888"></A
>
that system is in doubt. Furthermore, some intruders just want
to compromise the integrity of data. We are all familiar with cases
where intruders gain access to a Web server and change the data on the
server in order to embarrass the organization that runs the Web site.
Thinking about the impact network threats have on your data can make
it easier to assess the threat.</P
><p class="para">Network threats are not, of course, the only threats to computer security,
or the only reasons for denial of service. Natural disasters<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16892"></A
><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16894"></A
>
and internal threats (threats from people who have
legitimate access to a system)
are also serious. Network security has had a lot of publicity, so it's
a fashionable thing to worry about; but more computer time has probably
been lost because of fires<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16896"></A
>
than has ever been lost because of network
security problems. Similarly, more data has probably been improperly
disclosed by authorized users than by unauthorized break-ins. This book
naturally emphasizes network security, but network security is only part
of a larger security plan that includes physical security and disaster
recovery plans.</P
><p class="para">Many traditional (non-network) security threats are handled, in part,<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16899"></A
>
by physical security. Don't forget to provide an adequate level of
physical security for your network equipment and cables. Again, the
investment in physical security should be based on your realistic
assessment of the threat.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16902"></A

><div class="sect2"><h3 class="sect2"><a class="title" name="TCP2-CH-12-SECT-1.2">12.1.2 Distributed Control </A
></H3
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="TCP2-CH-12-IX-DISTRIBUTED-CONTROL"></A
>One approach to network security is to distribute responsibility for,
and control over, segments of a large network to small groups within
the organization. This approach involves a large number of people in
security, and runs counter to the school of thought that seeks to
increase security by centralizing control. However, distributing
responsibility and control to small groups can create an environment of
small networks composed of trusted hosts. Using the analogy of small
towns and big cities, it is similar to creating a neighborhood watch to
reduce risks by giving people connection with their neighbors, mutual
responsibility for one another, and control over their own fates.</P
><p class="para">Additionally, distributing security responsibilities formally
recognizes one of the realities of network security&nbsp;- most security
actions take place on individual systems. The managers of these
systems must know that they are responsible for security, and that
their contribution to network security is recognized and appreciated.
If people are expected to do a job, they must be empowered to do it.</P

>Subnets are a possible tool for distributing network control. A subnet<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16916"></A
>
administrator should be appointed when a subnet is created. She is then responsible for the security of the network
and for assigning IP addresses to the devices connected to
the networks. Assigning IP addresses gives the subnet
administrator some control over who connects to the subnet. It
also helps to ensure that she knows each system connected and who is responsible for that system. When the
subnet administrator gives a system an IP address, she also delegates
certain security responsibilities to the system's administrator.
Likewise, when the system administrator grants a user an account, the
user takes on certain security responsibilities.</P
><p class="para">The hierarchy of responsibility<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-16920"></A

flows from the network administrator,
to the subnet administrator, to the system administrator, and finally
to the user. At each point in this hierarchy the individuals are given
responsibilities and the power to carry them out. To support this
structure, it is important for users to know what they are 
responsible for and how to carry out that responsibility. The network
security policy described in the next section provides this
information.</P

system for disseminating security information to each group. Mailing
lists for each administrative level can be used for this purpose. The
network administrator receives security information from outside
authorities, filters out irrelevant material, and forwards the relevant
material to the subnet administrators. Subnet administrators forward
the relevant parts to their system administrators,
who in turn forward what they consider important to the individual users.
The filtering of information at each level ensures that individuals get
the information they need, without receiving too much.

begin to ignore everything they receive.</P
