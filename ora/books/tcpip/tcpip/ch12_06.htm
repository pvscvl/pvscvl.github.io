> is a technique for limiting access to the data carried
on the network. Encryption encodes the data in a form that can be
read only by systems that have the &quot;key&quot; to the encoding scheme. The original
text, called the &quot;clear text,&quot;<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18333"></A
>
is encrypted using an encryption device
(hardware or software) and an encryption key. This produces encoded<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18335"></A
>
text, which is called the cipher.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18338"></A
>
To recreate the &quot;clear text,&quot; the
cipher must be decrypted<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18340"></A

using the same type of encryption device and 
an appropriate key.</P
><p class="para">Largely because of spy novels and World War II movies, encryption is one
of the first things that people think of when they think of security.
However, encryption is not always applicable to network security.
Encrypting data for transmission across a network requires that the
same encryption equipment, or software, be used at both ends of the
data exchange. Unless you control both ends of the network and can
ensure that the same encryption device is available, it is difficult to
use end-to-end data encryption.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18343"></A
>
For this reason, encryption is most
commonly used<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18346"></A
>
to exchange data in individual applications where the
software at both ends of the network is defined by a single vendor.
For example, a Web server and a Web browser from the same vendor use
the same encryption. Encrypting all types of data is limited to
places where the entire system is under the control of a single
authority, such as military networks, private networks, individual
systems, or when the individuals at both ends of the communication can
reach personal agreement on the encryption technique and key.</P
><p class="para">What is needed to make encryption truly useful in a global network are
universally recognized encryption standards and a trusted infrastructure
to support those standards.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18350"></A

network like the Internet. Public-key systems encode the clear-text with
a key that is widely known and publicly available, but the cipher can
only be decoded back to clear-text with a secret key. This means that
Dan can look up Kristin's public key in a trusted database and use it to
encode a message to her that no one else can read. Even though everyone
on the Internet has access to the public key, only Kristin can decrypt the
message using her secret key. Kristin can then look up Dan's public key
to encrypt her reply. This encrypted communication takes place without
Dan or Kristin ever divulging their secret keys. However, to ensure that the 
keys have not been tampered with, public-key
cryptography requires a trusted system for distributing public keys.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18356"></A
>
And because the encrypting key is available to everyone, it requires a
digital signature system<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18358"></A
>
to authenticate that a message is really from whom it purports to be from.</P
><p class="para">Government and industry are working on the standards and infrastructure
for public-key cryptography. The type of encryption used in the
examples in this section is symmetric encryption.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-18361"></A
>
It requires that
the same encryption technique and the same secret key is used for
both encrypting and decrypting the message. It does not rely on
public keys, digital signatures, or a widely accepted infrastructure,
but its usefulness is limited. Truly effective public-key cryptography
must wait for the creation of a trusted public-key infrastructure.</P

><p class="para">Before using encryption, decide why you want to encrypt the data,
whether the data should be protected with encryption, and
whether the data should even be stored on a networked computer
system.</P
><p class="para">A few valid reasons for encrypting data are:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">To prevent casual browsers from viewing sensitive data files</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">To prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">To prevent privileged users (e.g., system administrators) from viewing
private data files</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">To complicate matters for intruders who attempt to search through a
system's files</P
></LI
></UL
><p class="para">Encryption is not a substitute for good computer security. Encryption
can protect sensitive or personal information from casual snooping,
but it should never be the sole means of protecting critical
information.  Encryption systems can be broken, and encrypted data can
be deleted or corrupted just like any other data. So don't let
encryption lull you into a false sense of security. Some information
is so sensitive or critical that it should not be stored on a
networked computer system, even if it is encrypted. Encryption is only
a small part of a complete security system. To find out more about
