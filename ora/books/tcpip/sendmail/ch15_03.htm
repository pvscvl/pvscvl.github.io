>Recall that in the hub/client setup, all mail goes to the hub
machine and none is ever delivered directly to the client. This requires
two things: that all mail to the client be automatically
sent to the hub machine instead of to the client and that
the hub machine accept mail
addressed to the client as though that mail were addressed
to the hub machine instead.
Forcing all mail to go to the
hub machine requires special Mail Exchanger (MX) records.</P
><p class="para">If you already administer DNS, the changes that we will make are
easily accomplished. If you don't, you will have to ask your DNS administrator
to make the changes for you.
How DNS interacts with <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> is described in greater detail in 
<a class="xref" href="ch21_01.htm" title="DNS and sendmail">Chapter 21, <cite class="chapter">DNS and sendmail</CITE
></A
>.
You may want to jump ahead to that chapter, and then return
here, to better understand the changes we are making.</P
><p class="para">To arrange for all mail to go to the hub machine,
first find the primary file for your DNS zone. We won't tell you
where to find it, because either you know where it is or you probably
lack permission to edit it.
Somewhere in the primary file for your DNS zone is an
entry for the local client. It looks something like this:</P
><p class="para"><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">here            IN      A       123.45.67.8
                IN      HINFO   Sun4/75 unix</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
></P
><p class="para">Remember that the local machine is <em class="emphasis">here.us.edu</EM
>. The entry for
this machine begins with its hostname (with the domain part
omitted). The <code class="literal">IN</CODE
> says that this is an Internet-type
entry&nbsp;- the only type that is currently supported. The A<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-8459"></A
>
says that this is an <em class="emphasis">address</EM
> record, one that associates
an IP address with a hostname. The IP address is the <em class="emphasis">dotted
quad</EM
> that follows (the <code class="literal">123.45.67.8</CODE
>).</P
><p class="para">Other lines may follow the A
record. Here, we show an HINFO (host information)
record that describes the hardware and the operating system
for the local machine.</P
><p class="para">&#13;Immediately below the A record for the local machine,
add a new MX record:</P

>Two pieces of information are necessary for
an MX record. The first is a relative
preference (the <code class="literal">13</CODE
>), which must be a number.
The preference is used only when there is more than one
MX record for a host. If there were two, the host with
the lower preference would be tried first and then the host with
the higher preference if the first failed.
The number that is selected doesn't
matter, because there is only one MX record for this host.</P
><p class="para">The second item (the one following the preference) is the name
of the hub machine to which mail will be sent in place of sending
it to the client. If the domain part for both the hub machine
and the client machine is the same, only the hostname of the
hub machine needs to appear in this record. The hostname
of the hub in all our examples has been <code class="literal">mail</CODE
>, 
so that is what we used:</P

><p class="para">You should, of course, replace <code class="literal">mail</CODE

of your central mail-handling machine.</P
><p class="para">If the hub machine is in a different domain than the client,
a fully qualified domain name needs to be specified in place of
<code class="literal">mail</CODE

For example, if all local mail is being sent offsite
to the central server at <em class="emphasis">wash.dc.gov</EM
>, the following would appear:</P

>If you place a fully qualified name in an MX record,
be sure to terminate that name with a dot. That dot tells DNS
that this name is complete. Without it, DNS automatically
appends your local domain to the name, resulting in an unknown address.
In the entry <code class="literal">mail</CODE

<code class="literal">mail</CODE

><p class="para">After you've made this change, you need to wait for the old

>
of the Time To Live (TTL) that is defined for the record. A TTL can
appear in two places. It can appear in the A record,
or it can appear elsewhere as a default TTL. If the TTL appears in
the A record, it will be a number between the hostname
and the <code class="literal">IN</CODE

><p class="para">TTL values are always in seconds. Here, the A record will
time out and any new information will be updated after eight hours have elapsed.
Depending on when it was last updated, you may have to wait up to
eight hours for the new MX record to be recognized.</P
><p class="para">If the A record has a TTL, you should duplicate that TTL
in the new MX record so that they both time out together:</P

stored with them but are defined by a default TTL elsewhere.

specify one. Here, that default

A record lacks them), you will need to wait the default
TTL period of time for the new MX record to become known.</P

If you have permission to 
change the zone file, you have doubtless changed it before
and are familiar with the missing steps. If you haven't, a short
section like this one can't begin to give you the information you
need to manage DNS.
