>Disasters can take many forms and, by their very nature, are unexpected.
If DNS and mail are to continue to work, expecting the unexpected is vital.
The kinds of disasters that one must anticipate vary from
the mundane to the catastrophic:</P
><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A reboot or scheduled down-time for dumps on the mail or DNS server
should only cause mail to be delayed, not lost.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">A failed component on the mail or DNS server could cause mail delivery
to be delayed anywhere from a few hours to a few days.
A delay of over three to five days could cause many hosts to bounce queued mail
unless steps are taken to receive that mail elsewhere.</P
></LI
><li class="listitem"><p class="para">Natural disasters can disrupt site or network connectivity for
weeks. The Loma Prieta earthquake on the West Coast of the United States
lasted only a few minutes but knocked out electric power to many areas
for far longer. 
Fear of gas leaks prevented repowering many buildings for up to two
weeks. A hurricane, flood, fire, or even an errant backhoe
could knock out your institution for weeks.</P

>When mail can't be received, whether because of a small event
or a large disaster, an offsite MX host can save the day. An offsite
MX host is simply another machine that can receive mail for your site
when your site is unavailable. The location of the offsite machine depends
on your situation. For a subdomain at one end of a microwave link,
having an offsite host on the other side of the microwave might be sufficient. For
a large site, such as a university, a machine at another university
(possibly in a different state or country) would be wise.</P
><p class="para">Before we show how to set up offsite MX hosts,
note that offsite MX hosts are not an unmixed blessing.
If an offsite MX host does not handle mail reliably, you
could lose mail.  In many cases it is better not to have an
offsite MX host than to have an unreliable one.  Without
an MX site, mail will normally be queued on the sending host.
A reliable MX backup is useful, but an unreliable one is a disaster.</P
><p class="para">You should not unilaterally select a host to function as an offsite
MX host.
To set up an offsite MX host, you need to negotiate with the
managers of other sites. By mutual agreement, another site's manager
will configure that other machine to accept mail bound for your
site (possibly queueing weeks' worth of mail) and configure that
site to forward that mail to yours when your site comes back up.</P
><p class="para">For example, suppose your site is in the state of Iowa, in the United
States. Further suppose that in
Northern Japan there is a site with which you are friendly.
You could negotiate with that site's manager to receive and hold your mail in
a disaster. When the site is set up to do so, you first
add a high-cost MX record for it:</P

><p class="para">This verifies that the disaster
MX machine can get mail to your site when it returns to service.</P
><p class="para">During a disaster 
the first sign of trouble will be mail for your site suddenly
appearing in the queue at <em class="emphasis">pacific.north.jp</EM
>. The manager
there should notice and set up a separate queue to hold the
incoming mail until your site returns to service (see <a class="xref" href="ch23_07.htm#SML2-CH-23-SECT-7-1" title="Handling a Down Site">Section 23.7.1, "Handling a Down Site"</A
>).
When your site recovers, you can contact that manager and arrange
for a queue run to deliver the backlog of mail. </P
><p class="para">If your site is out of service for weeks, the backlog of mail
might be partly on tape or some other backup media. You might
even want to negotiate an artificially slow feed so that
your local spool directory won't overfill.</P
><p class="para">Even in minor disasters an MX host can save much grief because
delivery will be serialized. Without an MX host, every machine
in the world that had mail for your machine would try to send
it at the same time, that is, when  your machine returns to service. 
That could overload your machine and even crash it, causing the problem to repeat over
and over.&#13;</P

>A disaster MX is good only as long as your DNS services stay alive to
advertise it.
Most sites have multiple name server machines to balance the load of
DNS lookups and to provide redundancy in case one fails.
Unfortunately, few sites have offsite name servers as a hedge against
disaster. Consider the disaster MX record developed above:</P
><p class="para"><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">mailhost.uiowa.edu.   IN   MX 900   pacific.north.jp.</PRE

Unfortunately, all DNS records contain a Time To Live (TTL) that
may or may not be present in the declaration line:</P

><p class="para">When other sites look up the local site, they cache this record.
They will not look it up again until 24 hours have passed. Therefore
if an earthquake strikes, all other sites will forget about this
record after 24 hours and will not be able to look it up again.</P
><p class="para">In general, records set up for disaster purposes should be given
TTLs that are over a month:</P

></PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
></P
><p class="para">But note that TTLs should be the same for all records
so that they will all time out the same:</P
><p class="para"><blockquote class="screen"><pre class="screen">mailhost.uiowa.edu.  3600000 IN   MX 2     mailhost.uiowa.edu.
mailhost.uiowa.edu.  3600000 IN   MX 10    backup.uiowa.edu.
mailhost.uiowa.edu.  3600000 IN   MX 900   pacific.north.jp.</PRE
></BLOCKQUOTE
></P
><p class="para">If you gave the disaster record
a long TTL and left the default for your normal MX records,
your normal records would time out and disappear from other sites' caches.
This would result in all mail suddenly and mysteriously going to the disaster
host when there was no disaster to cause it.</P
><p class="para">Note that long TTLs can make updates to your DNS files
awkward. Updates won't take effect until the TTL times out.
If you anticipate a future change, say a rearrangement of your MX
records, you can change the TTLs to 2 hours, wait a month for
the long TTL to time out, then make and test your changes.

><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[17] And hope that no disaster strikes in the meanwhile. A better technique
is to set up an offsite secondary DNS server with a large TTL
in the SOA record.</P

><p class="para">If many hosts at your site receive mail (rather than a central
mail server), it is necessary to add a disaster
record for each. Unfortunately, when the number of such hosts at
your site is greater than 100 or so, individual disaster
MX records become difficult to manage simply because of scale.</P
><p class="para">At such sites, a better method of disaster preparedness is to
set up <em class="emphasis">pacific.north.jp</EM

the local site. There are two advantages to this &quot;authoritative&quot;
backup server approach:</P
