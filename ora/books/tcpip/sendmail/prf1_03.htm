>I have to admit that I'm surprised by how well <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM

It's not because of a large marketing organization or a
deep-pockets budget.  I think there are three reasons.</P
><p class="para">First, <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> took the approach that it should try to accept,
clean up, and deliver even very &quot;crufty&quot; messages instead of
rejecting them because they didn't meet some protocol.  I felt
this was important because I was trying to gateway UUCP to the
ARPAnet.  At the time, the ARPAnet was small, UUCP was anarchy
(some say it still is), and UNIX mail programs generally didn't even
understand headers.  It was harder to do, but after all, the goal was
to communicate, not to be pedantic.</P
><p class="para">Second, I limited myself to the routing function&nbsp;- I wouldn't
write user agents or delivery back-ends.  This was a departure
from the dominant thought of the time, where routing logic, local
delivery, and often the network code was incorporated directly
into the user agents.  But it did let people incorporate their
new networks quickly.</P
><p class="para">Third, the <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> configuration file was flexible enough to
adapt to a rapidly changing world:  The 1980s saw the proliferation of new protocols,
networks, and user agents.</P
><p class="para">And, of course, it didn't hurt that it was free, available at
the right time, and did what needed to be done.</P
><p class="para">Configuring <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> is complex because the world is complex.
It is dynamic because the world is dynamic.
Someday <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>, like X11, will die&nbsp;- but I'm not holding my
breath.  In the meantime, perhaps this book will help.</P
><p class="para">When I started reviewing Bryan's manuscript, I had been avoiding
any major work on <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>.  But then I started reading
about various petty bugs and annoyances that all seemed easy to
fix.  So I started making small fixes, then larger ones; then
I went through RFC1123 to bring the specs up-to-date, cleaned
up a bunch of eight-bit problems, and added ESMTP.  It would be
fair to say that the book and <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> Version 8 fed on each
other&nbsp;- each has improved the presence of the other.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-118"></A
