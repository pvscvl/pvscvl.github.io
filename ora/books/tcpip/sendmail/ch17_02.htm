finds anything surrounded by square brackets (it does
not care whether that anything is an IP address). If found, it prefixes the

to the value in <code class="literal">$j</CODE

If the IP address is not that of the local host, the third rule
causes it to be immediately returned as a valid (but not local)
IP address.</P

that address unchanged.
Review <a class="xref" href="ch17_01.htm" title="UUCP Addresses">Section 17.1.4, "UUCP Addresses"</A
> to see how the .UUCP suffix
came to be attached in the first place. </P
><p class="para">Any address that has made it this far is next looked up with
DNS:</P

></P
><p class="para">Here, the notation <code class="literal">$~P</CODE
> denotes anything that is <em class="emphasis">not</EM
> in the
class <code class="literal">P</CODE
>. That class was declared elsewhere. It contains a list
of pseudo-domains (domains that cannot be looked up with DNS, such
as UUCP and BITNET).
If the last component of the hostname is other than one of the
pseudo-domains, the RHS causes that hostname to be looked up
with DNS and replaced with the full canonical name for that host.
If the hostname corresponds to a CNAME, it will be replaced with
the name of the corresponding A or MX record.
If the address is an IP address (such as <em class="emphasis">[123.45.67.80]</EM
>),
a PTR record will be looked up to find the canonical name.
If the lookup fails, the name is unchanged.
If the lookup succeeds, the canonical name will replace the looked
up name and a dot will be appended.
[5]
On some machines this lookup may use <em class="emphasis">/etc/hosts</EM
>, <em class="emphasis">nis</EM
>,
<em class="emphasis">nisplus</EM
>, or some other means defined by your service switch file.
In the configuration file that we have been examining, a successful DNS lookup causes a dot
to be appended to the resulting hostname. This the same as what has
been done all along by adding a dot to <code class="literal">$j</CODE
>.</P

also explains how to change the dot to a different character or characters.</P

a dot to any valid addresses that lack one:</P

no way to check their validity.
The second rule strips any extra trailing dots in case they may have been added
by accident.

a dot is added, thus finishing rule set 96's job.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-9366"></A
