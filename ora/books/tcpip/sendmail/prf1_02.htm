>The <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> program was originally written by
Eric Allman while he was a student and staff member at the University 
of California at Berkeley.
At the time,
one campus machine (<em class="emphasis">Ingres</EM
>)
was connected to the ARPAnet,
and was home to the INGRES project where Eric was working.
Another machine (<em class="emphasis">Ernie CoVax</EM
>)
was home to the Berkeley UNIX project and had recently started using UUCP.
These machines (as well as several others on campus)
were connected by a low-cost network built by Eric Schmidt, called BerkNet.
Software existed to move mail within ARPAnet,
within UUCP, and within BerkNet,
but none yet existed to move mail between these three networks.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-52"></A
>A sudden increase in protocol types, coupled with the
anticipation of an explosion in the number of networks,
motivated Eric to write <em class="emphasis">delivermail</EM
>&nbsp;- the
precursor to <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>. The <em class="emphasis">delivermail</EM
> program
was shipped in 1979 with 4.0 and 4.1 BSD UNIX. Unfortunately, <em class="emphasis">delivermail</EM
>
was not flexible enough to handle the changes in mail routing
requirements that actually occurred. Perhaps its greatest weakness
was that its configuration was compiled-in.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-59"></A
>In 1980, ARPAnet began converting from NCP (Network Control
Protocol) to TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). This change
increased the number of possible hosts from 256 to over one billion.
Another change converted from a &quot;flat&quot; host-name space (like
MIT-XX) into a hierarchical name space (like
XX.MIT.EDU). Prior to these changes, mail was transported
using the <em class="emphasis">ftp</EM
> protocol (File Transfer Protocol). Afterward,
a new protocol was developed for transporting mail called SMTP (Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol). These developments were not instantaneous.
Some networks continued to run NCP years after most others
switched to TCP. SMTP itself underwent many revisions before
finally settling into its present form.</P
><p class="para">Responding to these and other changes, Eric evolved <em class="emphasis">delivermail</EM
>
into <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>.
To ensure that messages transferred
between networks would obey the conventions required by those
networks,
Eric took a &quot;liberal&quot; approach&nbsp;- modifying address information to
conform, rather than rejecting it. At the time, for example,
UUCP mail often had no headers at all, so <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>
had to create them from scratch.</P
><p class="para">The first <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> program was shipped with 4.1c BSD
(the first version of Berkeley UNIX to include TCP/IP).
From that first release to the present,
[1]
Eric has continued to
enhance <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>, first at UC Berkeley, then at Britton Lee, then back
at UC Berkeley, and now with InReference Inc. 
The current version of <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> is 8.x (or
V8 for short). V8 is a major rewrite that includes many bug
fixes and significant enhancements.</P
><blockquote class="footnote"><p class="para">[1] With one long gap between 1982 and 1990.</P

><p class="para">But Eric wasn't the only one working on <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>. 
In 1987, Lennart Lovstrand of the University of Link&ouml;ping, Sweden,
developed the IDA enhancements to BSD <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> Version 5.
IDA (which stands for &quot;Institutionen f&ouml;r Datavetenskap&quot;)
injected a number of improvements
into <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> (such as support for <em class="emphasis">dbm</EM
> files and separate rewriting
of headers and envelopes) and fixed a number of bugs. As the '90s
approached, two offspring of IDA appeared.</P
><p class="para"><a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-78"></A
>Neil Rickert (Northern Illinois University) 
and Paul Pomes (The University of Illinois) 
took over maintenance of IDA <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>.
With contributions from around the world, their
version (UIUC IDA) represents a continuation of
the work begun by Lennart Lovstrand.
Neil 
focused on fixing and enhancing the configuration files
into their current <em class="emphasis">m4</EM
>-based form. Paul
maintained the
code, continually adding enhancements and fixing bugs. In general,
their version was large, ambitious, and highly portable. It succeeded
in solving many complex mail routing problems.</P
><p class="para">A variation on IDA <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> was also developed by Paul Vixie
(while at Digital Equipment Corporation).
Called KJS (for King James <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>), it was a more conservative
outgrowth of Lennart Lovstrand's last IDA release. The focus of KJS
was on code improvement rather than changes to configuration files.</P
><p class="para">In addition to these major offshoots, many vendors have modified
<em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> to suit their particular needs.
Sun Microsystems made many modifications and enhancements to
<em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>, including support for <em class="emphasis">nis</EM
> and <em class="emphasis">nisplus</EM
> maps.
Hewlett Packard also contributed many fine enhancements including
8BITMIME support.</P
><p class="para">This explosion of <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> versions has led to a great
deal of confusion. Solutions to problems that work for one version
of <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
> fail miserably with others. Beyond this,
configuration files are not portable, and some features cannot be shared.</P
><p class="para">In 1994, Eric began work on V8.7 <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>. 
The first major departure from tradition in years, V8.7
introduces multicharacter option and macro names,
new interactive commands to use with -bt mode, and fixes many of the problems
and limitations of earlier releases.
But, more important, V8.7 has officially adopted most of the good features
from IDA, KJS, Sun, and HP's <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>, and kept abreast of
the latest standards from the Internet Engineering Task Force.
In 1996, Eric began work on V8.8 <em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>. This release continued the trend
begun with V8.7, adding many requested new features and options, and tightening security.
Since V8.8 is now the official release of
<em class="emphasis">sendmail</EM
>, it is the one solely documented in this book.<a class="indexterm" name="AUTOID-98"></A
