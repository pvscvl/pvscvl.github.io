>Oracle Corporation called the Oracle7 Server Version 7.1 the "Parallel Everything" server. It offered parallel query, parallel index updates, and many other features that take advantage of the symmetric multiprocessors readily available today. The parallelization of the RDBMs is an important advance in raw performance, but Oracle Corporation didn't stop there. It also "made public" (i.e., available to outside developers) a package of procedures and functions&nbsp;-- <A

CLASS="para"
>Now here's the really exciting part: the advantages of DBMS_PIPE are not confined to the Oracle RDBMs. You also can use DBMS_PIPE in all sorts of new and creative ways. You can parallelize your own programs. You can communicate between a client program in Oracle Forms and a server-based process, without having to commit any data. You can build a debugger for your server-side <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN
> programs.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>The DBMS_PIPE package is just one of many such mind- and functionality-expanding new resources. Do you need to issue your own locks? Do you need to detect whether another process in your current session has committed data? Use the DBMS_LOCK package. Do you want to issue messages from within your <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN
> programs to help trace and debug your program? Check out the DBMS_OUTPUT package. Would you like to schedule jobs within the RDBMs itself? Explore the DBMS_JOB package. The list goes on and on, and is constantly growing. With the Oracle-supplied packages, you have at your disposal many of the same tools used by the internal Oracle product developers. With these tools, you can do things never before possible!</P
