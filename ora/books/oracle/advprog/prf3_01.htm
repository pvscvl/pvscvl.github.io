>I am firmly of the belief that one never stops learning&nbsp;-- as long as one is open to learning. The area of <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN

But I started to realize that this wasn't enough. Over the past year, I have been designing and developing a set of packages to help me build <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN
>-based applications. This was a thoroughly selfish effort: I wanted to be as productive as possible, and I wanted to overcome a number of weaknesses&nbsp;-- however transient&nbsp;-- in the <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN
> language. In the process of writing this software, I learned a good deal about the best ways to build <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN
> code, especially regarding packages. I also discovered some very interesting techniques that can make packaged software more maintainable, accessible, and easy to use. </P

CLASS="para"

>How often do you find yourself writing a program and simultaneously thinking: somebody must have done this before! You feel certain that you are reinventing the wheel. Worse, if you are sufficiently honest with yourself, you will also admit that someone else has probably spent more time on the problem and has already come up with a better solution than you are likely to develop for your specific application.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Often, you know you should take the time to "genericize" a program so that you can use it again and again in different circumstances. Somehow, however, you never find the time&nbsp;-- and the mental space&nbsp;-- to take your code to that higher level of abstraction.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>So you limp along, accepting a relatively low level of productivity and reusing a truly minimal amount of code. You write the same things over and over and simply push aside the feeling that you are wasting your time.</P

>Oracle developers are fortunate to be able to use an advanced, robust language like <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"

CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN
> developers are, on the other hand, less than fortunate (at least as of September 1996) to find that the supporting environment for <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN
> is still very immature. Where are the debuggers, the code formatters and generators, the toolboxes of reusable programs and objects? When will we have a powerful editor that knows about <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN
> syntax and&nbsp;-- more importantly&nbsp;-- the stored code available for execution?</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>When, you might also ask, will this guy stop complaining? It is acceptable to identify weaknesses. It is constructive to analyze areas for improvement. At some point, however, you have to stop whining and start improving things for yourself. Best yet, keep on whining but engage in self-improvement at the same time!</P

> programmers. Finally, I hope that it will, via examination of my source code and the way I separated functional areas in PL/Vision, offer a blueprint for <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"

> Students who attend my training sessions soon come to realize after a day or two that the answer to almost any question I ask is: "Build a package." They also often stumble out of the sessions chanting the mantra: "Packages, packages, packages..." I wrote this book and the companion software because I believe that packages are the single most important element of the <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN
> language. You can never go wrong putting your code inside a package. You will, on the other hand, almost always regret not placing your functions and procedures inside packages from the get-go.</P

(Unless otherwise noted, all references in this book to PL/Vision are to PL/Vision Lite.) You might use just a little bit of PL/Vision; you might leverage every single package into your production applications. Many readers will do nothing more than cannibalize PL/Vision, learning from these packages how to improve their own code. All of these variations are welcome and encouraged!</P

>Make my readers more creative and effective problem solvers.</EM
> I've had a wonderful time thinking about how to modularize and construct in layers basic packages to improve <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PL/SQL</SPAN
> programming. I learned about effective ways to construct packages and about all kinds of magic you can do when you internalize the features and benefits of packages stored in shared memory. When I encountered an obstacle, I didn't throw up my hands and look for a workaround. Instead, I asked myself: "What kind of package can I build to solve this problem?" That attitude forced me to be creative, and there is nothing more exciting than unleashed creativity. I hope that this book and the software that comes with it inspires every one of my readers to fashion new answers to old questions and newer answers to new questions. You will never regret the conceptual leaps you take in the process.</P
