>We (the authors and O'Reilly &amp; Associates) are committed to providing comprehensive, useful coverage of the PL/SQL language over the life of this language. The first edition of this book covered most of PL/SQL's features as it existed through PL/SQL Release 2.3. With the release of Oracle8, however, we faced a challenge: how do we fit all the new technologies of PL/SQL8 into <CITE
CLASS="citetitle"
>Oracle PL/SQL Programming</CITE
> and fill out coverage of existing elements of PL/SQL without creating a tome so unwieldy that reading the book becomes as much a physical as a mental workout? </P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Furthermore, if we look ahead a few years, we can easily expect that Oracle will continue to roll out expanded functionality in the objects area, as well as providing new and enhanced built-in packages. Given this situation, it quickly became clear to us that it was not practical to offer a single text which covered "all things PL/SQL." </P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Two questions then arose: what do we cut and what do we do with the stuff that we cut? The answers are as follows: </P

CLASS="systemitem.url"
HREF="../../../../../../../www.revealnet.com/"
>http://www.revealnet.com</A
>) allowing you rapid access to the many utilities and samples. Now, instead of having to look through a directory listing and then using an editor to view those files, you will be able to mouse-click and drill-down your way to the topics in which you are interested. We take advantage of this interface to give you an easy way to examine the many examples of packages I built for the book. </P

>Remove the chapter on built-in packages and expand it into a complete book. This chapter in the first edition offered lots of good information, but it was not comprehensive and simply couldn't keep growing to absorb all the new technology issuing forth from Oracle headquarters. Moving coverage of built-in packages to its own book will give us room to provide more and better information about this key element of the PL/SQL language. <A

These chapters contain numerous examples, along with tips on how, when, and where to apply these programming constructs most effectively. When you complete this section of the book you will know how to apply all the constructs of the PL/SQL language. You will also be able to examine the complex requirements in your own applications and use the different parts of PL/SQL to implement those requirements. </P

>Chapters 18 through 21 contain the main discussion of the new features of Oracle8&nbsp;-- in particular, object types, new types of collections (nested tables and VARRAYs), object views, and external procedures. Although we describe Oracle8 enhancements as appropriate in other sections of the book, we localize the major discussion here. Doing so allows developers new to Oracle8 to learn about the features in a coordinated way. It also lets developers still working on Oracle7 systems to skip over much of the discussion until it is more relevant to them. </P

Whether you use this book as a teaching guide or as a reference, I hope that it will have a significant impact on your ability to use PL/SQL most effectively. </P
