There are just too many fields and too much repetition for the mind to focus and take it all in. With the nested record, I shift the complexity of each individual phone number down a level into its own record type. This way the contact_set_rectype is self-explanatory: it's made up of four different phone numbers. </P

> Today, my phone number might have only five components. Why not just lay them all out there in the record? Because down the road my manager tells me that a phone number needs to also store a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for calling cards. As a result, I have denormalized my data structure within the unnested record (with all the same downside denormalization has in the RDBMS). I now need to add four different fields to this record, all with the same datatypes and the right naming conventions. The more coding I do, the greater the chance that I will introduce errors into that code. </P

>With nested records, on the other hand, I could simply add a single field to the phone_rectype record type. I do not have to change the contact_set_rectype record. The contact_set_rectype automatically has that extra field available to it in each of its nested records. The resulting nested record structure allows me to easily keep all phone numbers in one place and access them instantly. </P

>At the beginning of this chapter I mentioned that nested records let you carry over the normalized data structures of your database to the memory structures in your programs. Using nested records I was able to avoid hardcoding the internal structure of a phone number multiple times in my contact set record. Oddly enough, you can also use nested records to take your normalized data from the database and denormalize that data inside your program so it is easier to manipulate. </P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Well-designed relational data structures are usually normalized, which means (roughly) that you eliminate redundant information and repeating groups. Consider a company entity. It might have four different kinds of addresses: receiving, shipping, accounts payable, and customer relations. Each address is made up of seven attributes or columns: address lines one through four, city, state, and zip code. Rather than burden the company table with 28 (7 × 4) columns for all four addresses, you would create a separate table of addresses with a foreign key back to the company table. By creating a separate table for company addresses, you also can easily add another kind of address for a company at a later date. </P

><P
CLASS="para"
>While normalized data and foreign keys make sense enough inside a database, these concepts can be very confusing to users and actually present barriers to efficient and straightforward manipulation of the data within your programs. There is a simple reason for this seeming contradiction: real objects in the world are not normalized. Sure, in the most general sense a company can have four or more addresses. But in the real world, a particular company has only one or two addresses. And those addresses are not separate in any way from the company. They are a part of the definition of that company. Therefore, when data is in the database it is normalized, but whenever it is presented to or entered by the user it needs to be denormalized back to its natural state. Our programs, whether they are screens or reports or batch processes, must translate between these two perspectives on the data. </P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Nested records provide a highly structured and efficient mechanism to perform this translation. Consider the situation of the company and its multiple addresses. Suppose I have a set of procedures and functions which are used to fetch company information from the database and then manipulate that information. Ideally, I would like to be able to pass to these modules a single record which contains all that company's information. This would be difficult to do if I were to keep my program data normalized like its database counterpart, stored separately, and linked via foreign keys. So how about if I create a nested record? </P
