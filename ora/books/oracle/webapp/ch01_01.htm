> Since it burst on the scene in the early 1990s, the World Wide Web has transformed from a way (to quote Homer Simpson) to "let us know some nerd's opinion on Star Trek" to a whole new way of doing business. Hardly an area in the information technology industry has been unaffected. Developers who only yesterday were using COBOL to write accounts payable systems are now being asked to create a broad range of new Internet-based applications, including electronic commerce (e-commerce) web sites, internal data warehouses, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.</P

This type of development enables companies to apply well-understood, reliable, production-quality database methodologies to web content management. Oracle8<EM

>Flush with both the successes of the World Wide Web and its potential to generate new revenues, companies are scrambling madly to exploit Internet technologies. Internet technology is now commonly required for at least four different types of projects: internal application projects, like data warehousing; mobile application projects, like sales-force automation; electronic commerce, like Internet storefronts; and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for automating business operations. </P

In addition to responding quickly, these systems must often meld several different kinds of data&nbsp;-- table data, images, and even videos&nbsp;-- into an attractive page. </P
