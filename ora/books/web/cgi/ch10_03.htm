<p class=para>
The functions
used to set up sockets in Perl have the same names as the corresponding
UNIX system functions, but the arguments to the
socket functions are slightly different, because of the way Perl
works. Let's look at an example that implements a client to the
finger server.

<p class=para>
Please note that this not a CGI script. However, it should
be very easy to convert this to a CGI script if so desired. It is
meant to be run from the command line and to be passed one argument,
the name of the user you want information about:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
% finger_client username[@host]
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
As you can see, the calling format is identical to that of
the UNIX <i class=emphasis>finger</I> command.
In fact, this program works in the same exact manner.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
require "sys/socket.ph";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The Perl header file "
socket.ph"
contains definitions pertaining to different types of sockets, their
addressing schemes, etc. We will look at some of these definitions
in a moment.

<p class=para>
If this file is not found, you (or the system administrator)
need to run the <i class=emphasis>h2ph</I>
Perl script that converts all the C/C++ header files into a format
that Perl can understand. Now, let's continue.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
chop ($hostname = `bin/hostname`);
$input = shift (@ARGV);
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The current hostname is retrieved with the UNIX
<i class=emphasis>hostname</I>
command. And the input to the script is stored in the <i class=emphasis>input</I>
variable. The <i class=emphasis>shift</I>
statement simply returns the first element of an array.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
($username, $remote_host) = split (/@/, $input, 2);
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The specified username and remote host are split from the
<i class=emphasis>input</I> variable.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
unless ($remote_host) {
    $remote_host = $hostname;
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If no host is specified, it defaults to the local host.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$service = "finger";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Once you create a socket,
it is usually bound (or attached) to a port on the machine. In order
to send a message-or request-to the server, you have to send it
to the port the server is running on. Generally, most of the common
servers (like FTP, Archie, Gopher, HTTP, and
Finger) run on specific ports, and are usually the same on nearly
all hosts across the Net. Otherwise, clients on different machines
would not be able to access the servers, because they would not
know what port the server is bound to. A list of all the ports and
the servers attached to them are listed in the <i class=emphasis>/etc/services</I>
file.

<p class=para>
In this case, we are specifying the server's name, and not
the port number. In case you are curious, the <i class=emphasis>finger</I>
server runs on port 79. Later on, the <i class=emphasis>getservbyname</I>
function converts the service "finger" to the correct port number.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$socket_template = "S n a4 x8";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This represents a 16-byte structure that is used with sockets
for interprocess communications on the Internet. The first two bytes
represent the numeric codes for the Internet address family in the
byte order the local machine uses for short integers. The next two
bytes represent the port number you want to connect to, in Internet
standard byte order (i.e., big endian-the high byte of the integer
is stored in the leftmost byte, while the low byte is stored in
the rightmost byte). Bytes four through eight represent the IP address,
and the last eight contain "\0" characters. We will see this in
action soon.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$tcp = (getprotobyname("tcp"))[2];
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Since the <i class=emphasis>finger</I> server is set up as
a TCP protocol (don't worry about what this means!), we need to
get a numeric code that identifies this protocol. The <i class=emphasis>getprotobyname</I>
functions returns the name, alias, and number of the specified protocol.
In our case, we are storing just the third element, as we do not
need the others. As a side note, the constant AF_NS (from the sockets.ph
header file) can be used instead of calling the <i class=emphasis>getprotobyname</I>
function.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
if ($service !~ /^\d+$/) {
    $service = (getservbyname ($service, "tcp"))[2];
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If the service specified in the variable is not a numeric
value, the <i class=emphasis>getservbyname</I> function uses the
<i class=emphasis>/etc/services </I>file to retrieve the port number.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$current_address = (gethostbyname ($hostname))[4];
$remote_address  = (gethostbyname ($remote_host))[4];
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>gethostbyname</I> function converts a
host name into a packed string that represents the network location.
This packed string is like a common denominator; it needs to be
passed to many functions. If you want to convert this string into
the IP address, you have to unpack the string:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
@ip_numbers = unpack ("C4", $current_address);
$ip_address = join (".", @ip_numbers);
unless ($remote_address) {
    die "Unknown host: ", $remote_host, "\n";
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If the packed string representing the remote host is not defined,
it signifies that the location does not exist.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$current_port = pack ($socket_template, &amp;AF_INET, 0, $current_address);
$remote_port  = pack ($socket_template, &amp;AF_INET, $service, $remote_address);
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
These two lines are very important! Using the socket template
we discussed earlier, three values representing the Internet addressing
scheme, the port number, and the host name, are packed to create
the socket structure that will be used to actually create the socket.
The <i class=emphasis>&amp;AF_INET</I> is a subroutine defined
in the socket header file that refers to the Internet addressing
(i.e., 128.197.27.7) method. You can also define other addressing
schemes for sockets, such as <i class=emphasis>&amp;AF_UNIX</I>,
which uses UNIX pathnames to identify sockets
that are local to a particular host.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
socket (FINGER, &amp;AF_INET, &amp;SOCK_STREAM, $tcp) || die "Cannot create socket.\n";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>socket</I>
function creates a TCP/IP (Internet Protocol) socket called FINGER,
which can actually be used as a file handle (as we will soon see).
That is one of the simple beauties of sockets: Once you get through
the complicated connecting tasks, you can read and write them like
files.

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>&amp;SOCK_STREAM</I>
(another subroutine defined in the header file) value indicates
that data travels across the socket as a stream of characters. You
can also choose the <i class=emphasis>&amp;SOCK_DGRAM</I>
paradigm in which data travels in blocks, or datagrams. However,
<i class=emphasis>SOCK_STREAM</I> sockets are the easiest to use.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
bind (FINGER, $current_port)   || die "Cannot bind to port.\n";
connect (FINGER, $remote_port) || die "Cannot connect to remote port.\n";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>bind</I> statement attaches the FINGER
socket to the current address and port. Finally, the <i class=emphasis>connect</I>
function connects the socket to the server located at the address
and port specified by <i class=emphasis>remote_port</I>. If any of
these functions fail, the script terminates.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$current_handle = select (FINGER);
$| = 1;
select ($current_handle);
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This group of statements is used to unbuffer the socket, so
the data coming in and going out of the socket is displayed in the
correct order.

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
print FINGER $username, "\n";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The specified username is sent to the socket. The <i class=emphasis>finger</I>
server expects a username only. You can test to see how the <i class=emphasis>finger</I>
server works by using telnet to connect to port 79 (where the server
resides):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
% telnet acs.bu.edu 79
Trying 128.197.152.10 ...
Connected to acs.bu.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.
shishir
.
.
. (information returned by the server for user "shishir")
.
.
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
To complete our program:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
while (&lt;FINGER&gt;) {
    print;
}
close (FINGER);
exit (0);
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
The while loop simply reads the information output by the
server, and displays it. Reading from the socket is just like reading
from a file or pipe (except that network errors can occur). Finally,
the socket is closed.

<p class=para>
If you found the explanation of socket creation confusing,
that is OK. You will not have to write code like this. An easier
set of functions will be explained shortly.
