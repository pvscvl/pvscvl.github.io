<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="CGI-APP-A-SECT-4">A.4 Specific Programming Questions</A></h2>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.17">I want the user to fill in a form and mail it to me. How can I do this? Are there any examples to show me how?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
It is actually a fairly simple process. Your CGI
script must be able to perform two tasks:

<p class=para>
Decode the form data. Remember, all data in the
form will be URL encoded (let's ignore Netscape 2.0 multipart MIME
messages).

<p class=para>
Open a pipe to <i class=emphasis>mail</I> (or <i class=emphasis>sendmail</I>),
and write the form data to the file.

<p class=para>
Let's assume you have an associative array called <i class=emphasis>$in</I>
(for those of you using Steven Brenner's <i class=emphasis>cgi-lib.pl</I>
library, this should be familiar) that contains the form data. Here
is how you would deal with <i class=emphasis>sendmail</I>:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
open (SENDMAIL, "| /usr/bin/sendmail -f$in{'from'} -t -n -oi");
print SENDMAIL &lt;&lt;End_of_Mail;
From: $in{'from'} &lt;$in{'name'}&gt;
To: $in{'to'}
Reply-To: $in{'from'}
Subject: $in{'subject'}
$in{'message'}
End_of_Mail
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
One thing you should note is the "Reply-To:"
header. Since the server is running as user "nobody," the mail headers
might be messed up (especially when people are trying to reply to
it). The "Reply-To:" field fixes that.

<p class=para>
There are a lot of mail gateways in operation that use <i class=emphasis>mail</I>
in the following format:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
open (MAIL, "| mail -s 'Subject' $in{'to'}");
                                     ^
                                     |
                                     +-- Possible security hole!!!!
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If you don't check the <i class=emphasis>$in{'to'}</I> variable
for shell metacharacters, you're in for a major headache! For example,
if some malicious user enters the following:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
; rm -fr / ;  
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
you'll have a major problem on your hands.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.18">The formmail script looks complicated. Why can't I use a mailto: URL so that it just mails me the info the user filled in?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Unfortunately, the <i class=emphasis>mailto:</I>
command is not supported by all browsers. If you have this command
in your document, it is a limiting factor, as people who use browsers
that do not support this do not have the ability to send you mail.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.19">How do I do Perl CGI programming from non-UNIX platforms like the Mac, MS-DOS, Windows, and NT? Will my Perl CGI program port amongst all these environments? Can it be transparent? I have an account on a UNIX server, but work on a Windows/Mac system. How can I test my CGI script on my own system?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Perl has been ported to all the platforms that are
mentioned above. As a result, your Perl CGI program should be reasonably
portable. If you're are interfacing with various external programs
on the UNIX side, then it probably will not be
portable, but if you're just manipulating data, opening and reading
files, etc., you should have no problem.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.20">What are STDERR, STDIN, and STDOUT connected to in a Perl CGI program?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
In a CGI environment, STDERR
points to the server error log file. You can use this to your advantage
by outputting debug messages, and then checking the log file later
on.

<p class=para>
Both STDIN and STDOUT
point to the browser. Actually, STDIN points
to the server that interprets the client (or browser's) request
and information, and sends that data to the script.

<p class=para>
In order to catch errors, you can "dupe" STDERR
to STDOUT early on in your script (after outputting
the valid HTTP headers):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
    open (STDERR, "&gt;&amp;STDOUT");
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
This redirects all of the error messages to STDOUT
(or the browser).

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.21">How do I write an access counter script?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Counter scripts tend to be very popular. The idea
behind a counter is very simple:

<p>
<ol class=orderedlist>
<li class=listitem>Use a file to store the data

<p>
<li class=listitem>Whenever someone visits the site, increment the
number in the file

<p>
</OL>
<p class=para>
Here is a simple counter script:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
$counter = "/home/shishir/counter.dat";
print "Content-type: text/plain", "\n\n";

open (FILE, $counter) || die "Cannot read from the counter file.\n";
flock (FILE, 2);
$visitors = &lt;FILE&gt;;
flock (FILE, 8);
close (FILE);
$VISITORS++;
open (FILE, "&gt;" . $counter) || die "Cannot write to counter file.\n";
flock (FILE, 2);
print FILE $visitors;
flock (FILE, 8);
close (FILE);
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
You can now use SSI (Server Side Includes) to display a counter
in your HTML document:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
You are visitor number:
 
&lt;!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/counter.pl--&gt;  
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.22">How can I strip all the HTML tags from a document with a Perl substitute?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Here is a simple regular expression that will strip
HTML tags:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$line =~ s/&lt;(([^&gt;]|\n)*)&gt;//g;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Or you can "escape" certain characters in an HTML
tag so that it can be displayed:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$line =~ s/&lt;(([^&gt;]|\n)*)&gt;/&amp;lt;$1&amp;gt;/g;
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.23">How can I tell what user/host/browser called my program?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
You can use the environment 
variable HTTP_USER_AGENT
to determine the user's browser.

<p class=para>
<i class=emphasis>[ From WWW FAQ ] </I>

<p class=para>
Five important environment variables are available to your
CGI script to help in identifying the end user.

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry>HTTP_FROM<dd>

<p class=para>
This environment variable is, theoretically, set to the email
address of the user. However, many browsers do not set it at all,
and most browsers that do support it allow the user to set any value
for this variable. As such, it is recommended that it be used only
as a default for the reply email address in an email form.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>REMOTE_USER<dd>

<p class=para>
This variable is only set if secure authentication was used
to access the script. The AUTH_TYPE variable
can be checked to determine what form of secure authentication was
used. REMOTE_USER will then contain the name
the user authenticated under. Note that REMOTE_USER
is only set if authentication was actually used, and is not supported
by all web servers. Authentication may unexpectedly fail to happen
under the NCSA server if the method used for
the transaction is not listed in the <i class=emphasis>access.conf</I>
file (i.e., <tt>&lt;Limit GET POST&gt;</TT>
should be set rather than the default, <tt>&lt;Limit GET&gt;</TT>).

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>REMOTE_IDENT<dd>

<p class=para>
This variable is set if the server has contacted an IDENTD
server on the client machine. This is a slow operation, usually
turned off in most servers, and there is no way to ensure that the
client machine will respond honestly to the query, if it responds
at all.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>REMOTE_HOST<dd>

<p class=para>
This variable will not identify the user specifically, but
does provide information about the site the user has connected from,
if the hostname was retrieved by the server. In the absence of any
certainty regarding the user's precise identity, making decisions
based on a list of trusted addresses is sometimes an adequate workaround.
This variable is not set if the server failed to look up the hostname
or skipped the lookup in the interest of speed; see REMOTE_ADDR
below. Also keep in mind that you may see all users of a particular
proxy server listed under one hostname.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry>REMOTE_ADDR<dd>

<p class=para>
This variable will not identify the user specifically, but
does provide information about the site the user has connected from.
REMOTE_ADDR will contain the dotted-decimal IP
address of the client. In the absence of any certainty regarding
the user's precise identity, making decisions based on a list of
trusted addresses is sometimes an adequate workaround. This variable
is always set, unlike REMOTE_HOST, above. Also
keep in mind that you may see all users of a particular proxy server
listed under one address.</DL>
<p class=para>
<i class=emphasis>[ End of info from WWW FAQ ] </I>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.24">Can people read my Perl CGI program? If they do, is it a security problem that they know how my code works? How can I hide it?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
If you configure your server so that it recognizes
that all files in a specific directory (i.e., <i class=emphasis>/cgi-bin</I>),
or files with certain extensions (i.e., <i class=emphasis>.pl</I>,
<i class=emphasis>.tcl</I>, <i class=emphasis>.sh</I>, etc.) are CGI
programs, then it will execute the programs. There is no way for
users to see the script itself.

<p class=para>
On the other hand, if you allow people to look at your script
(by placing it, for example, in the document root directory), it
is not a security problem, in most cases.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.25">Do I have to copy the whole Perl library into my htdocs directory?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
No, your CGI scripts can access files outside the server and
document root directories, unless the server is running in a <i class=emphasis>chroot</I>-ed
environment.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.26">Why shouldn't I have people type in passwords or social security numbers or credit card numbers? Isn't that what TYPE<i class=command>="password"</i> is for?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<i class=emphasis>No!</I> The forms interface allows
you to have a "password" field, but it should not be used for anything
highly confidential. The main reason for this is that form data
gets sent from the browser to the Web server as plain text, and
not as encrypted data.

<p class=para>
If you want to solicit secure information, you need to purchase
a secure server, such as Netscape's Commerce Server 
(<a href="../../../../../../../home.netscape.com/comprod/netscape_commerce.html">http://home.netscape.com/comprod/netscape_commerce.html</A>).

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.27">How do I generate separate pages for Netscape vs. the rest of the world?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
You can have your CGI script determine whether your script is being accessed by Netscape:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$browser = $ENV{'HTTP_USER_AGENT'};
if ($browser =~ /Mozilla/) {
    #
    # Netscape
    #
} else {
    #
    # Non Netscape
    #
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.28">Why doesn't my system ( ) output come out in the right order?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
This has to do with the way the standard output
is buffered. In order for the output to display in the correct order,
you need to turn buffering off by using the $| variable:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$| = 1;  
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.29">I hear that Netscape is going to support Java. Does that mean I have to use Java now instead of Perl? Should I?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
No, no! The concept of Java is totally different
from that of CGI. CGI refers to server-side execution, while Java
refers to client-side execution. There are certain things (like
animations) that can be improved by using Java. However, you can
continue to use Perl to develop server-side applications.

<p class=para>
For more information, here are a few documents you can look
at:

<p class=para>
Sun's Java Documentation (<a href="../../../../../../../sun.java.com/">http://sun.java.com</A>)

<p class=para>
<i class=emphasis>Java uber Alles (</I>
<a href="../../../../../../../mox.perl.com/perl/versus/java.html">http://mox.perl.com/perl/versus/java.html</A><i class=emphasis>)</I>by Tom Christiansen (tchrist@mox.perl.com)

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.30">How can I access my environment variables? Why are they different sometimes?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
You can access the environment variables through
the <i class=emphasis>%ENV</I> associative array. Here is a simple
script that dumps out all of the environment variables (sorted):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/plain", "\n\n";
foreach $key (sort keys %ENV) {
    print $key, " = ", $ENV{$key}, "\n";
}
exit (0);
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.31">Why does my output get mangled (like "if b &lt; a" is messed up)?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
If you send a MIME content type
of HTML, you will have to "escape" certain characters,
such as "&lt;," "&amp;," and "&gt;", or else the browser will think
it is HTML.

<p class=para>
You have to escape the characters by using the following construct:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&amp;#ASCII Code;  
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Here is a simple script that you can run on the command line
that will give you the ASCII code for non-alphanumeric
characters:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
print "Please enter a string: ";
chop ($string = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
$string =~ s/([^\w\s])/sprintf ("&amp;#%d;", ord ($1))/ge;
print "The escaped string is: $string\n";
exit (0); 
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.32">How come when I run it from the command line, my Perl CGI program works, but it doesn't work when I run it from the browser?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
This most likely is due to permission problems.
Remember, your server is probably running as "nobody," "www," or
a process with very minimal privileges. As a result, it will not
be able to execute your script unless it has permission to do so.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.33">How come my Perl CGI program runs fine but doesn't manage to write its output files?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Again, this has to do with permissions! The server
cannot write to a file in a certain directory if it does not have
permission to do so.

<p class=para>
You should make it a point to check for error status from
the <i class=emphasis>open</I> command:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
.
.
.
open (FILE, "&gt;" . "/some/dir/some.file") ||
    print "Cannot write to the data file!";
.
.
.
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.34">How do I make a form that maintains state, or has several entry points?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
You can use the CGI::MiniSvrmodule (<i class=emphasis>http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/
software/WWW/CGIperl/docs/MiniSvr.pm.html</I>) to keep state
between multiple entry points.

<p class=para>
Or you can create a series of dynamic documents that pass
a unique session identification (either as a query, an extra path
name, or as a hidden field) to each other.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.35">How do I debug my Perl CGI program without running it from a web browser?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
It's difficult to debug a CGI script. You can emulate
a server by setting environment variables manually:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
setenv HTTP_USER_AGENT "Mozilla/2.0b6"       (csh)
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
or

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
export HTTP_USER_AGENT = "Mozilla/2.0b6"     (ksh, bash)
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
You can emulate a POST request by placing
the data in a file and piping it to your program:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
cat data.file | some_program.pl  
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Or, you can use CGI Lint, which will automate some of this.
It will also check for potential security problems, errors in <i class=emphasis>open
( ),</I> and invalid HTTP headers.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.36">How can I call a Perl CGI program without using a <tt>&lt;FORM&gt;</TT> tag?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
You can call a CGI program by simply opening the URL to it:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
http://some.machine/cgi-bin/your_program.pl 
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
You can also have a link in a document, such as:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;A HREF="http://some.machine/cgi-bin/your_program.pl"&gt; 
Click here to access my CGI program&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.37">How do I stop people from calling my form without filling out anything? Why do they keep doing this?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Why people do this, I don't know. But, you can check
the information from all the fields and return a "No Response" if
any of them are empty. Here is an example (assume the associative
array <i class=emphasis>$in</I> contains your form information):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$error = 0;
foreach $value (values %in) {
     $value =~ s/\s//g;
     $error = 1 unless ($value);
}
if ($error) {
    print "Content-type: text/plain\n";
    print "Status: 204 No Response\n\n";
    print "You should only see this message if your browser does";
    print "not support the status code 204\n";
} else {
    #
    # Process Data Here
    #
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.38">What are all the server response codes (http://www.w3.org/hypertext/ WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html) and what do they mean?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A CGI program can send specific response codes to
the server, which in turn will send them to the browser. For example,
if you want a "No Response" (meaning that the browser will not load
a new page), you need to send a response code of 204 (see the answer
to the last question).

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.39">Why doesn't <tt class=literal>print "Location: http://host/page.html\n"</tt> <i class=emphasis>work? Why does it only work the first time and get the redirects wrong later?</I></A></h3>

<p class=para>
A CGI program can only send <i class=emphasis>one</I>
Location
header. You also cannot send a MIME content type
if you want the server to perform redirection. For example, this
is not valid, though it may work with some servers:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
.
.
.
print "Content-type: text/plain\n"
print "Location: http://some.machine/some.doc\n\n"";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
How can I automatically include a:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
"Last updated: ..."  
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
<i class=emphasis>line at the bottom of all my HTML pages? Or can
I only do that for SSI pages? How do I get the date of the CGI script?</I>

<p class=para>
If you are dynamically creating documents
using CGI, you can insert a time stamp pretty easily. Here is an
example in Perl 5:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$last_updated = localtime (time);
print "Last updated: $last_updated\n";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
or in Perl 4:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
require "ctime.pl";
$last_updated = &amp;cmtime (time);
print "Last updated: $last_updated\n";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
or even:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
$date = `/usr/local/bin/date`;
print "Last updated: $last_updated\n";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
You can accomplish this with SSI like this:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"--&gt;  
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="appa-SECT2-AUTOID.40">When is a Perl CGI program too complex for a simple task and only a shell will do? When is it not powerful enough for a hard one? Isn't C++ much better for this kind of thing? What about C?</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Each language has its own advantages and disadvantages.
I'm sure you've heard this many times: It depends on what you're
trying to do. If you are writing a CGI program that's going to be
accessed thousands of times in an hour, then you should write it
in C or C++. If you are looking for a quick solution (as far as
implementation), then Perl is the way to go!

<p class=para>
You should generally avoid the shell for any type of CGI programming,
just because of the potential for security problems.
