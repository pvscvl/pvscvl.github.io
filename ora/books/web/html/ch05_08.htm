<p class=para>
Ever since the publication of Vernor Vinge's groundbreaking
science-fiction novelette <i class=emphasis>True Names</I> in 1978,
many computer programmers and users have been fascinated by the ideas
of ``virtual reality'' and
``cyberspace''--computer interfaces using 3D
surround graphics with which a user could interact in something like
the way our physical bodies interact with the real world.

<p class=para>
In 1994, two Silicon Valley programmers with backgrounds in computer
graphics went public with the provocative idea that the
distributed-hypertext model of HTML might be used
as a foundation for building cyberspace. A working group began
adapting and enhancing a graphics-description language previously
developed at Silicon Graphics Inc. to be used with
HTML and Web software.

<p class=para>
The result was Virtual Reality Markup Language
(VRML). VRML follows the
HTML model in several important respects. Like
HTML, VRML is a content-based,
plain-ASCII markup language that describes its
universe at a high level, and leaves it up to the browser or client
program to make detailed presentation decisions.
VRML technology has since evolved even more rapidly
than the Web itself. As of January 1996, several first-cut
VRML browsers are available, including an add-on
for the popular Netscape browser for PCs.

<p class=para>
VRML documents describe worlds populated with
3D shapes. Developers build objects from basic shapes,
such as cubes, cones, and spheres, with a variety of surface
effects, including texture maps and lighting, available for composing
realistic objects. It's possible to associate URLs
with objects in a VRML world in such a way
that when a user touches the object, they are transported to another
VRML world, an HTML document, or
a CGI script (which itself may generate a
VRML world).

<p class=para>
Some intriguing demonstration interfaces to large databases have
already been built and suggest the beginnings of true cyberspace
architecture. So far, however, these demonstrations fall short of the
strong virtual-reality experience depicted in science-fiction books
and movies. Three related problems bar the way. The design problem
is that VRML currently has no capacity to do animation.
VRML worlds are static. While it's easy to move the
user's viewpoint in a VRML world, the only way to
actually move or alter a VRML object is to generate an
entirely new document and render it. Proposals to support animation
description are in the works, but none have yet been adopted as of
January 1996. This may well have changed by the time you read this.

<p class=para>
The second, practical problem is that reasonably priced desktop
machines in 1996 simply don't have the capacity to do realistic
animation of general scenes. The computational cost of point-plotting,
hidden-line elimination, texture-mapping, and lighting calculations
gets very large, very quickly. Companies that care about animation,
like Industrial Light and Magic, use multimillion-dollar
special-purpose supercomputers for this job because they have
to. Current VRML browsers, for example, frequently
have to drop back from full-surface rendering to wire-frame mode when
moving the viewer's eyepoint. Even without animation, rendering of
static images including texture-mapping, spheres and sculpted surfaces
can take many seconds, which is unacceptably slow.

<p class=para>
The third problem is that VRML worlds are not yet
shared spaces. For virtual reality to begin to approach the
interactive richness of the real world, it must be possible to
interact in a VRML world not merely with
objects but with the ``avatar'' or cyberspatial
manifestations of other users. This is an area of very active interest
to the VRML developers (many of whom have been
directly inspired by the Black Sun environment depicted in Neil
Stephenson's immensely popular science-fiction novel, <i class=emphasis>Snow
Crash</I>), but no single solution has yet emerged.

<p class=para>
(There are other, comparatively minor problems:
VRML has no sound capability, for example. But it's
easy to imagine a solution for this one within current technology.)

<p class=para>
Thus, VRML is still currently more a promise and a
technology direction than a complete answer to the virtual-reality
question. But the trend-curves of desktop hardware performance and the
amount of money being poured into better multimedia graphics
accelerators make it one worth careful watching. With another few
years' hardware evolution and a few foreseeable
VRML language enhancements, a true distributed
cyberspace, built around and using WWW servers, may
well be within our reach.
