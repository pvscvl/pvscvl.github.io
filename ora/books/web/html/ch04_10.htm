<p class=para>
For the most part, characters within HTML documents
that are not part of a tag are rendered as-is by the browser. However,
some characters have special meaning and are not directly rendered,
while other characters can't be typed into the source document
from a conventional keyboard. Special characters need either a special
name or a numeric character encoding for inclusion in an
HTML document.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH04-SECT-10.1">Special HTML Characters</A></h3>

<p class=para>
As has become obvious in the discussion and examples leading up to
this section of the book, three special characters in
HTML source documents have very special meaning:
the less-than sign (&lt;), greater-than sign (&gt;), and ampersand
(&amp;). These characters delimit tags and special character
references. They'll confuse a browser if left dangling alone or
with improper tag syntax. So you've got to go out of your way to
include their actual, literal characters in your
HTML documents. The only exception to this is that
these character may appear literally within the
<tt>&lt;listing&gt;</TT> and <tt>&lt;xmp&gt;</TT> tags.

<p class=para>
Similarly, you've got to use a special encoding to include
double quote characters within a quoted string, or when you want to
include a special character that doesn't appear on your keyboard
but is part of the ISO Latin-1 character set implemented and supported
by most browsers.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH04-SECT-10.2">Inserting Special Characters</A></h3>

<p class=para>
To include a special character in your HTML
document, you enclose either its standard entity name or a hash mark
(#) and its numeric position in the Latin-1 standard
character set[2]
 inside a leading ampersand and an ending semicolon, without any
 spaces in between. Whew. That's a long explanation for what is
 really a simple thing to do, as the following example illustrates. It
 shows how to include a greater-than sign in a snippet of code by
 using the character's entity name. It also demonstrates how to
 include a greater-than sign in your HTML text by
 referencing its Latin-1 numeric value:

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
The very familiar ASCII character set is a subset
of the more comprehensive Latin-1 character set. Composed by the
well-respected International Organization for Standardization
(ISO), the Latin-1 set is a list of all the
letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and so on, commonly used by
Western language writers, organized by number and encoded with special
names. <a href="appd_01.htm">Appendix D</A> contains the complete Latin-1
character set and encodings.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
if a &amp;gt; b, then t = 0
if a &amp;#62; b, then t = 0
</PRE>
</DIV>


<p class=para>
Both examples cause the text to be rendered as:

<p class=para>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
if a &gt; b, then t = 0
</PRE>
</DIV>


<p class=para>
The complete set of character entity values and names are in <a href="appd_01.htm">Appendix D</A>. You could write an entire
HTML document using character encoding, but that
would be silly.
