<p class=para>
Until this point, we've dealt with HTML
documents as standalone entities, concentrating on the language
elements you use for structure and to format your work. The true power
of HTML, however, lies in its ability to join
collections of documents together into a full library of information,
and to link documents with other collections around the world. Just as
readers have considerable control over how the
document looks onscreen, with hyperlinks they also have control over
the order of presentation as they navigate through your
information. It's the ``HT'' in
HTML--hypertext--and it's the twist
that spins the Web.

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH06-SECT-1">6.1 Hypertext Basics</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH06.LINKS"></A>A fundamental feature of hypertext is that you can hyperlink
documents; you can point to another place inside the current document, inside
another document in the local collection, or inside a document
anywhere on the Internet. The documents thereby become an intricately
woven web of information. Get the name analogy now? The target
document is usually somehow related to and enriches the source; the
linking element in the source should convey that relationship to the
reader.

<p class=para>
Hyperlinks can be used for all kinds of effect. They can be used inside
tables of contents and lists of topics. With a click of the mouse on
their browser screen, readers select and automatically jump to a topic
of interest in the same document or to another document
located in an entirely different collection somewhere around the
world.

<p class=para>
Hyperlinks also  point readers to more information
about a mentioned topic. ``For more information, see
`Kumquats on Parade,''' for
example. HTML authors use hyperlinks to reduce
repetitive information. For instance, we recommend you sign your
name to each of your documents. Rather than include full contact
information in each document, a hyperlink connects your
name to a single place that contains your address,
phone number, and so forth.

<p class=para>
A hyperlink, or <i class=emphasis>anchor</I> in HTML
standard parlance, is marked by the <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag and comes
in two flavors. As we detail below, one type of anchor creates a hot
spot in the document that, when activated and selected (usually with a
mouse) by the user, causes the browser to link. It automatically loads
and displays another portion of the same or another document
altogether, or triggers some Internet service-related action, such as
sending email or downloading a special file. The other type of anchor
creates a label,[1]
 a place in an HTML document that
can be referenced as a hyperlink.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
         Both types of HTML anchors use the same
         tag; perhaps that's why they have the same name. Nonetheless, we find it's easier if you
         differentiate them and think of the one type that provides
         the hotspot and address of a hyperlink as the
         ``link,'' and the other type that marks the target
         portion of a document as the ``anchor.''
