<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-5">1.5 Nonstandard Extensions</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.HTML.EXT"></A><a name="CH01.EXTENSIONS"></A>You don't have to write in HTML 2.0 for long before
you realize its limitations. That's why Netscape Navigator is the most
popular browser used on the Web today. While others were content to
implement HTML standards, the developers at
Netscape were hard at work extending the language and their browser to
capture the potentially lucrative and certainly exciting commercial
markets on the Web. In a year after going into business, Netscape
captured over 70 percent of browser users.

<p class=para>
With a market presence like that, Netscape leads not only the market,
but the standards drive, as well. Those browser features that Netscape
provides and that aren't part of HTML 2.0 or the
proposed version 3.2 quickly become de facto standards because so many
people use them. Consequently, Netscape is the browser other
developers must emulate. For instance, Internet Explorer, developed in
collaboration with Spyglass and bundled with Windows 95, adopts most
of Netscape's enhancements to HTML and has some
embellishments of its own.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-5.1">Extensions: Pro and Con</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Every software vendor adheres to the technological standards; it's
embarrassing to be incompatible and your competitors will take every
opportunity to remind buyers of your product's failure to comply, no
matter how arcane or useless that standard might be. At the same time,
vendors seek to make their products different and better than the
competition's offerings. Netscape's extensions to standard
HTML are a perfect example of these market
pressures at work.

<p class=para>
Many HTML document authors feel safe using
Netscape's nonstandard extensions, because of its commanding share of
users. For better or worse, extensions to HTML made
by the folks at Netscape instantly become part of the
street version of HTML, much like English slang
creeping into the vocabulary of most Frenchmen despite the best
efforts of the Academie Fran&ccedil;aise.

<p class=para>
The reality, however, is that browsers are becoming less and less
standard--de facto or not. The W3C isn't keeping up. And other
browser developers are not about to remain quiescent for
long. Netscape holds the commanding lead now, but everyone can hear
the heavy footsteps of such technology powerhouses as Sun Microsystems
and Microsoft heading toward the Internet and the Web. Increasingly,
browser competitors are implementing many of the Netscape extensions
and adding a few of their own for good measure.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-5.2">Avoiding Extensions</A></h3>

<p class=para>
In general, we urge you to resist using an HTML
extension unless you have a compelling and overriding reason to do
so. By using them, particularly in key portions of your documents, you
run the risk of losing a substantial portion of your potential
readership. Sure, the Netscape community is large enough to make this
point moot now, but even so you are excluding several million people
without Netscape from viewing your pages.

<p class=para>
Of course, there are varying degrees of dependency on
HTML extensions. If you use some of the horizontal
rule extensions, for example, most other browsers will ignore the
extended attributes and render a conventional horizontal rule. On the
other hand, reliance upon a number of font size changes and text
alignment extensions to control your document appearance will make
your document look terrible on many alternative browsers. It might not
even display at all on browsers that don't support the extensions.

<p class=para>
We admit that it is a bit disingenuous of us to decry the use of
HTML extensions while presenting complete
descriptions of their use. In keeping with the general philosophy of
the Internet, we'll err on the side of handing out guns and rope to
all interested parties while hoping you have enough smarts to keep
from hanging yourself or shooting yourself in the foot.

<p class=para>
Our advice still holds, though: only use an extension where it is
necessary or very advantageous, and do so with the understanding that
you are disenfranchising a portion of your audience. To that end, you
might even consider providing separate, standards-based versions of
your documents to accommodate users of other browsers.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-5.3">Beyond Extensions: Exploiting Bugs</A></h3>

<p class=para>
It is one thing to take advantage of an extension to
HTML, and quite another to exploit known bugs in a
particular version of a browser to achieve some unusual document
effect.

<p class=para>
A good example is the multiple-body bug in version 1.1 of Netscape
Navigator. The HTML standard insists that an
HTML document have exactly one
<tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag, containing the body of the document. The
now-obsolete browser allowed any number of <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tags, processing and rendering each <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> in
turn. By placing several <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tags in an
HTML document, an author could achieve crude
animation effects when the document was first loaded into the
browser. The most popular one had several <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tags, each with a slightly different background color. This trick
results in a document fade-in effect.

<p class=para>
The party ended when version 1.2 of Netscape fixed the bug. Suddenly,
thousands of documents lost their fancy fade-in effect. Although faced
with some rather fierce complaints, to their credit the people at
Netscape stood by their decision to adhere to the
standard, placing compliance higher on their list of priorities than
nifty rendering hacks.

<p class=para>
In that light, we can unequivocally offer this advice:
<i class=emphasis>never</I> exploit a bug in a browser to achieve a
particular effect in your documents.
