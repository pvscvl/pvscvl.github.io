<p class=para>
We wrote this book for anyone interested in learning and using
HTML, from the most casual user to a full-time
design professional. We don't expect you to have any experience in the
language before picking up this book. In fact, we don't even expect
that you've ever used the World Wide Web, although we'd be surprised
if you haven't at least experimented with this technology. Being
connected to the Internet is not necessary to use this book, but if
you're not connected, this book becomes like a travel guide for the
homebound.

<p class=para>
The only things we ask you to have are a computer, a text editor
that can create simple ASCII text files, and a
World Wide Web browser like Netscape, Mosaic, or Internet Explorer for
your computer: the very latest version, if possible. Because
HTML is stored in a universally accepted
format--ASCII text--and because the
language is completely independent of any specific computer, we won't
even make an assumption about the kind of computer you're
using. However, browsers do vary by platform and operating system, which
means your HTML documents can and often do look
quite different depending on the computer and version of browser. We
will explain how certain language features are used by various popular
browsers as we go through the book, so don't be surprised if your
browser gets mentioned here or there.

<p class=para>
If you are new to HTML, the World Wide Web, or
hypertext documentation in general, you should start by reading <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, <i>HTML and the World Wide Web</i></A>. This chapter describes how all these
technologies come together to create webs of interrelated documents.

<p class=para>
If you are already familiar with the Web, but not
HTML specifically, or if you are interested in the
new features in HTML, start by reading <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>HTML Quick Start</i></A>. This chapter is a brief overview of the
most important features of the language and serves as a roadmap to how
we approach the language in the remainder of the book.

<p class=para>
Subsequent chapters deal with specific language features in a roughly
top-down approach to the HTML. Read them in order for a complete
tour through the language, or jump around to find the exact feature
you're interested in.
