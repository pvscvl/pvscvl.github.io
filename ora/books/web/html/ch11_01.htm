<a name="CH11.DYNAMIC1"></A><a name="CH11.DYNAMIC2"></A>The standard HTML document model is a static one:
once displayed on the browser, a document does not change unless the
user initiates some activity like selecting a hyperlink with the
mouse. The developers at Netscape Communications found that limitation
unacceptable and built in some special features to the Netscape
browser that lets you dynamically change HTML
document content. In fact, they provide for two different mechanisms
for dynamic documents, which we detail in this chapter.

<p class=para>
We should mention at the outset that many people believe Netscape
dynamic documents will be obsolete in a very short time, displaced by
plug-in browser accessories and, in particular, applets. Nonetheless,
Netscape continues to support dynamic documents, and we believe the
technology has virtues you should be aware of, if not take advantage
of, in your HTML documents. <i class=emphasis>[applets, <a href="ch05_06.htm">5.6</A>]</I>

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH11-SECT-1">11.1 An Overview of Dynamic Documents</A></h2>

<p class=para>
If you remember from our discussion in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, <i>HTML and the World Wide Web</i></A>, the client browser initiates data flow on
the Web by contacting a server with a document request. The server
honors the request by downloading the document. The client
subsequently displays the document's contents to the user. For
normal Web documents, a single transaction initiated from the client
side is all that is needed to collect and display the document. Once
displayed, however, it does not change.

<p class=para>
Dynamic documents, on the other hand, are the result of multiple
transactions initiated from either or both the server side and the
client side. 
A <i class=emphasis>client-pull</I> document is one that
initiates multiple transactions from the client side. When the server
is the instigator, the dynamic document is known as a
<i class=emphasis>server-push</I> document.

<p class=para>
In a client-pull document, special HTML codes tell
the client to periodically request and download another document from
one or more servers on the network, dynamically updating the display.

<p class=para>
Server-push documents also advance the way servers communicate with
clients. Normally over the Web, the client stays connected with a
server for only as long as it takes to retrieve a single
document.[1]
 With server-push documents, the connection remains open and the
 server continues to periodically send data to the client, adding to
 or replacing the previous contents.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
 One connection per document is true even for inline images browsers
         may automatically download from the server. If you
         don't believe us, just watch the status line at the
         bottom of your browser while you download an
         HTML document with several images. You
         should see many ``Contacting the server'' and
         ``Reading the file...'' or similar messages.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Netscape currently is the only browser able to handle dynamic
HTML documents correctly. With other browsers,
you'll see part of the dynamic document at best. At worst, the
browser will completely reject the document. Unfortunately, because
dynamic documents are client-server processes, they don't work
without an HTTP server. That means you can't
develop and test your dynamic HTML documents stored
as local files, unless you have a server running locally, as well.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH11-SECT-1.1">Another Word of Caution</A></h3>

<p class=para>
As always, we tell you exactly how to use these exciting, but
nonstandard features, and we admonish you not to use them unless you
have a compelling and overriding reason to do so. We are particularly
strident with that admonition for dynamic documents, not only because
they aren't part of the HTML standard, but
because dynamic documents can hog the network. They require
larger, longer downloads than their static counterparts. And they
require many more (in the case of client-pull) or longer-term (for
server-push) client-server connections. Multiple connections on a
single server are limited to a few of the vast millions of Web users
at a time. We'd hate to see your readers miss out because
you've created a jiggling image in a dynamic
HTML document that would otherwise have
been an effective and readily accessible static document more
people could enjoy.
