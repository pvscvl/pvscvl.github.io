<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-3">1.3 HTML: What It Is</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.HTML"></A>HTML is a document-layout and
hyperlink-specification language. It defines the syntax and placement
of special, embedded directions that aren't displayed by the browser,
but tell it how to display the contents of the document,
including text, images, and other support media. The language also
tells you how to make a document interactive through special
hypertext links, which connect your document with other documents in
yours and others' collections, as well as with other Internet resources,
like FTP and Gopher.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-3.1">HTML Standards and Extensions</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The basic syntax and semantics of HTML are defined
in the HTML standard, currently version
2.0. HTML is a young language, barely three years
old but already in its second iteration. Don't be too surprised if
another version appears before you finish reading this book. Given the
pace of these standards matters, one never knows when or if a new
standard version will come to fruition. While the
HTML 3.0 standard has faded into oblivion, the
standards committee is working to collect some of the more popular
browser extensions into an interim standard, known as
HTML 3.2.  The draft of this standard should become
available in July, 1996 and defines a base set of tags that almost all
current browsers support.

<p class=para>
Browser developers rely upon the HTML standard to
program the software that formats and displays common
HTML documents. Authors use the standard to make
sure they are writing effective, correct HTML
documents. Nonetheless, commercial forces have pushed
developers to add into their browsers--Netscape Navigator and
Internet Explorer, in particular--nonstandard
extensions meant to improve the language. Many times, these extensions
are implementations of future standards still under debate. Extensions
can foretell future standards because so many people use them.

<p class=para>
In this book, we explore in detail the syntax, semantics, and idioms
of HTML 2.0, along with the many important
extensions that are supported in the latest versions of the most
popular browsers, so that any aspiring HTML author
can create fabulous documents with a minimum of effort.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-3.2">Standards Organizations</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.STANDARDIZING"></A>Like many popular technologies, HTML started out as
an informal specification used by only a few people. As more and more
authors began to use the language, it became obvious that more formal
means were needed to define and manage--to standardize--HTML's
features, making it easier for everyone to create and share
documents.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-3.2.1">The World Wide Web Consortium</A></h4>

<p class=para>
The World Wide Web Consortium, aka W3C, was formed with the charter to
define the standard versions of HTML. Members are
responsible for drafting, circulating for review, and modifying the
standard based on cross-Internet feedback to best meet the needs of
the many.

<p class=para>
Beyond HTML, the W3C has the broader responsibility
of standardizing any technology related to the World Wide Web: they
manage the HTTP standard, as well as related
standards for document addressing on the Web. And they solicit draft
standards for extensions to existing Web technologies, such as
internationalization of the HTML standard.

<p class=para>
If you want to track HTML's development and related
technologies, contact the World Wide Web Consortium at <a href="../../../../../../../www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</A>. Several Internet
newsgroups are devoted to the World Wide Web, each a part of the
comp.infosystems.www
hierarchy. These include comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html and
comp.infosystems.www.authoring.images.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-3.2.2">The Internet Engineering Task Force</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Even broader in reach than W3C, the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) is responsible for defining and managing
every aspect of Internet technology. The World Wide Web is just one
small part under the purview of the IETF.

<p class=para>
The IETF defines all of the technology of the
Internet via official documents known as Requests For Comment, or
RFCs. Individually numbered for easy reference,
each RFC addresses a specific Internet
technology--everything from the syntax of domain names and the
allocation of IP addresses, to the format of electronic mail messages.

<p class=para>
To learn more about the IETF and to follow the
progress of various RFCs as they are circulated for
review and revision, visit the IETF home page, at
<a href="../../../../../../../www.ietf.org/">http://www.ietf.org/</A>.
