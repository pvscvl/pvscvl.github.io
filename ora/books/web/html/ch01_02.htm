<p class=para>
Every computer connected to the Internet (even a beat-up old Apple II)
has a unique address: a number whose format is defined by the
<i class=emphasis>Internet Protocol (IP)</I>, the standard that defines
how messages are passed from one machine to another on the Net. An
<i class=emphasis>IP address</I> is made up of four numbers, each less
than 255, joined together by periods, such as 192.12.248.73 or
131.58.97.254.

<p class=para>
While computers only deal in numbers, people prefer names. For this
reason, each computer on the Internet also has a name bestowed upon it
by its owner. There are several million machines on the Net, so it'd
be very difficult to come up with that many unique names, let alone
keep track of them all. Recall, though, that the Internet is a network
of networks. It is divided into groups known as
<i class=emphasis>domains</I>, which are further divided into one or
more <i class=emphasis>subdomains.</I> So, while you might choose a
very common name for your computer, it becomes unique when you append,
like surnames, all of the machine's domain names as a period-separated
suffix, creating a <i class=emphasis>fully qualified </I>domain name.

<p class=para>
This naming stuff is easier than it sounds. For example, the fully
qualified domain name ``www.ora.com'' translates to a
machine named ``www'' that's part of the domain known as
``ora,'' which, in turn, is part of the commercial
(com) branch of the Internet. Other branches of the
Internet include educational (edu) institutions, nonprofit
organizations (org), U.S. government (gov), and Internet service
providers (net). Computers and networks outside the United States have
a two-letter abbreviation at the end of their names: for example,
``ca'' for Canada, ``jp''
for Japan, and ``uk'' for the United Kingdom.

<p class=para>
Special computers, known as <i class=emphasis>name servers</I>, keep
tables of machine names and their associated unique IP numerical
addresses, and translate one into the other for us and for our
machines. Domain names must be registered with the nonprofit organization
InterNIC. Once registered, the owner of the domain
name broadcasts it and its address to other domain name servers
(DNS) around the world. Each domain and subdomain
has an associated name server, so ultimately every machine is known
uniquely by both a name and an IP address.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-2.1">Clients, Servers, and Browsers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The Internet connects two kinds of computers:
<i class=emphasis>servers</I>, which serve up documents, and
<i class=emphasis>clients</I>, which retrieve and display documents for
us humans. Things that happen on the server machine are said to be on
the <i class=emphasis>server side</I>, while activities on the client
machine occur <i class=emphasis>client side</I>.

<p class=para>
To access and display HTML documents, we run
programs called <i class=emphasis>browsers</I> on our client
computers. These browser clients talk to special <i class=emphasis>Web
servers</I> over the Internet to access and retrieve electronic
documents.

<p class=para>
Several Web browsers are available--most are free--each
offering a different set of features. For example, browsers like Lynx
run on character-based clients and display documents only as
text. Others run on clients with graphical displays and render
documents using proportional fonts and color graphics on a 1024x768,
24-bit-per-pixel display. Others still--Netscape Navigator,
Mosaic, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, WebCruiser from Netcom,
InterCon's NetShark, and Hot Java from Sun Microsystems, to name a
few--have special features that allow you to retrieve and display
a variety of electronic documents over the Internet, including audio
and movie multimedia.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-2.2">The Flow of Information</A></h3>

<p class=para>
All Web activity begins on the client side, when a user starts their
browser. The browser begins by loading a <i class=emphasis>home
page</I> HTML document from either local
storage or from a server over some network, such as the Internet. In
the latter case, the client browser first consults a domain name
server to translate the home page document server's name, like
www.ora.com, into an IP
address, before sending a request to that server over the
Internet. This request (and the server's reply) is formatted according
to the dictates of the <i class=emphasis>HyperText Transfer Protocol
(HTTP)</I> standard.

<p class=para>
A server spends most of its time listening to the Internet, waiting
for document requests with the server's unique address stamped on
it. Upon receipt, the server verifies that the requesting browser is
allowed to retrieve documents from the server and, if so, checks for
the requested document. If found, the server sends (downloads) the
document to the browser. The server usually logs the request, the
client computer's name, document requested, and the time.

<p class=para>
Back on the browser, the document arrives. If it's a plain-vanilla
ASCII text file, most browsers display it in a
common, plain-vanilla way. Document directories, too, are treated like
plain documents, although most graphical browsers will display folder
icons, which the user can select with the mouse to download
the contents of subdirectories.

<p class=para>
Browsers also retrieve binary files from a server. Unless assisted by
a <i class=emphasis>helper</I> program or specially enabled by
<i class=emphasis>plug-in</I> software or <i class=emphasis>applets</I>,
which display an image file or play an audio file, the
browser usually stores downloaded binary files directly on a local disk
for later attention by the user.

<p class=para>
For the most part, however, the browser retrieves a special document
that appears to be a plain text file, but contains both text and
special markup codes called <i class=emphasis>tags.</I> The browser
processes these HTML documents, formatting the text
based upon the tags and downloading special accessory files, such as
images.

<p class=para>
The user reads the document, selects a hyperlink to another document,
and the entire process starts over.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-2.3">Beneath the World Wide Web</A></h3>

<p class=para>
We should point out at this juncture that browsers and HTTP servers
need not be part of the Internet's World Wide Web to function. In
fact, you never need to be connected to the Internet, or to any
network for that matter, to write HTML documents
and operate a browser. You can load up and display on your client
browser locally stored HTML documents and accessory
files directly. This isolation is good: it gives you the opportunity
to finish, in the editorial sense of the word, a document collection
for later distribution. Diligent HTML authors work
locally to write and proof their documents before releasing them for
general distribution, thereby sparing readers the agonies of broken
image files and bogus hyperlinks.[2]

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
Vigorous testing of the HTML collection once it is
made available on the Web is, of course, also highly recommended and
necessary to rid it of various linking bugs.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
 Organizations,
too, can be connected to the Internet and the World Wide Web, but also
maintain private Webs and HTML document collections
for distribution to clients on their local network, or
<i class=emphasis>Intranet</I>. In fact, private Webs are fast becoming
the technology of choice for the paperless offices we've heard so much
about these last few years. With HTML document
collections, businesses and other enterprises can maintain personnel
databases, complete with employee photographs and online handbooks,
collections of blueprints, parts, and assembly manuals, and so
on--all readily and easily accessed electronically by authorized
users and displayed on a local computer.
