<p class=para>
Depending on our mood, when people ask us about the ``new''
HTML 3.2 standard, we respond with a groan, a bemused
smile, or uproarious laughter. Folks, HTML 3.2 doesn't
shake any Web foundations. In fact, the new language standard simply
confirms what most Web observers have known for some time now, that
Netscape Communications is the tail wagging the HTML
standards dog.

<p class=para>
Until about mid-1995, people actually were serious about
HTML standards. (Some of us still are.) Until then,
standards guided the development of new browsers. After release of
HTML 2.0, however, the elders of the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) responsible for such language-standards
matters lost control.  The abortive HTML+ standard never
got off the ground, and HTML 3.0 became so
bogged down in debate that the W3C simply shelved the entire
draft standard.

<p class=para>
What mired the development of new language standards was Netscape
Navigator. Most Web analysts agree that Netscape's quick success in
becoming the browser of choice for an overwhelming majority of users can be
attributed directly to the company's implementation of useful and exciting
additions to HTML. Today, all other browser
manufacturers, including the behemoth Microsoft Corp. who appreciates the
meaning of ``de facto standard'' better than anyone in the business,
have to implement Netscape's HTML extensions if they
expect to have any chance of competing in the Web browser marketplace. By
pushing the W3C to officially release HTML standard
version 3.2, which for all intents and purposes standardizes most of Netscape's
language extensions, the other browser manufacturers gain legitimacy for
their products without having to acknowledge the leading competitor.
Internet Explorer can now be ``HTML
3.2-compliant,'' rather than submissively ``Netscape
Navigator-compliant.''

<p class=para>
The paradox is that the HTML 3.2 standard is
<i class=emphasis>not</I> the definitive resource. There are many more
features of the language in popular use than are included in this latest
language standard.

<p class=para>
This book, on the other hand, is the definitive guide to
HTML. We give details for all the elements of the
HTML 2.0 standard, the elements of the proposed
HTML 3.2 standard, plus the variety of interesting
and useful extensions to the language that popular browser
manufacturers have chosen to include in their products, such as:Frames, Inline multimedia, Dynamic documents, Java, Text font size and face controls, and 

<p class=para>
And while we tell you about each and every feature of the language,
standard or not, we also tell you which browsers or different versions of
the same browser implement a particular extension and which don't. That's
critical knowledge when you want to create Web pages that take advantage of
the latest version of Netscape Navigator versus pages that are accessible to
the larger number of people using
Internet Explorer, Mosaic, or even Lynx, a popular text-only
browser for UNIX systems.

<p class=para>
In addition, there are a few things that are closely related but not directly
part of HTML. We touch, but do not handle, for example,
CGI and Java programming. CGI and
Java programs work closely with HTML documents and run
with or alongside browsers, but are not part of the language itself, and so
we don't delve into them. Besides, they are comprehensive topics that
deserve their own books, such as <i class=emphasis>Java in a Nutshell</I>
and <i class=emphasis>CGI Programming on the World Wide Web</I> from
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, for instance.

<p class=para>
In short, this book is your definitive guide to HTML as
it is and should be used, including every extension we could find. Many
aren't documented anywhere, even in the plethora of online guides. But, if
we've missed anything, certainly let us know and we'll put it in the next
edition.
