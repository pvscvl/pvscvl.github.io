<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3">5.3 Document Colors and Background Images</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.COLOR"></A>The HTML 2.0 standard makes no provision for
controlling text color and background appearance for documents,
instead allowing the local browser to determine the appearance of the
documents. In order to give local users more control, browsers let
them select text and background colors, as well as a background
image to display behind each document. The user selections are applied to
each document viewed.

<p class=para>
In an egalitarian move, the browsers also extended
HTML with various tags and attributes that let the
document author control the document background and colors. These tags
and attributes provide the maximum control to the author, letting
colors and backgrounds be different for each document and allowing
color changes for individual passages of text. <i class=emphasis>[<tt>&lt;font&gt;</TT>, <a href="ch04_06.htm">4.6.3</A>]</I>

<p class=para>
The local browser reigns supreme, however. User-selected color and
background preferences can be made to override those contained in a
document, undoing all the careful work of the document author.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1">Extensions to the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> Tag</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.BODYTAG1"></A><a name="CH05.BODYTAG2"></A><a name="CH05.BODYTAG3"></A>All extended attributes that control the document background,
text color, and document margins are used with the
<tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag.  <i class=emphasis>[<tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>, <a href="ch03_07.htm">3.7.1</A>]</I>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.1">The bgcolor attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
 
 
For Netscape and Internet Explorer users, you can change the default
background color in the browser window to another hue with the
bgcolor attribute for the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tag. Like the color attribute for the
<tt>&lt;font&gt;</TT> and various heading tags, the required value
of the bgcolor attribute may be expressed in either
of two ways: as the red, green, and blue (RGB)
components of the desired color or as a standard color name. <a href="appe_01.htm">Appendix E, <i>Color Names and Values</i></A>, provides a complete discussion of
RGB color encoding along with a table of acceptable
color names you can use with the bgcolor attribute.

<p class=para>
Setting the background color is easy. To get a pure red background
using RGB encoding, try:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;body bgcolor="#FF0000"&gt;</TT>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
For a more subtle background, try:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;body bgcolor=peach&gt;</TT>
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.2">The background attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
 
 
If a splash of color isn't enough, you may also place an image
into the background of a Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer
document display with the background attribute in its
<tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag.

<p class=para>
The required value of the background attribute is the
URL of an image. The browser automatically repeats
(tiles) the image both horizontally and vertically to fill the entire
window.

<p class=para>
You normally should choose a small, somewhat dim image to create an
interesting, but unobtrusive background pattern. Besides, a small,
simple image traverses the network much faster than an intricate,
full-screen image.

<p class=para>
<a href="#USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-18">Figure 5-18</A> shows you how the extended
browsers repeatedly render a single brick to create a wall of bricks
for the document background:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;body background="pics/onebrick.gif"&gt;</TT>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-18">Figure 5-18: One brick becomes many in a Netscape background</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/uhtml0518.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-18]" width=500 height=220>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
Background images of various dimensions and sizes create interesting
vertical and horizontal effects on the page. For instance, a tall
skinny image might set off your document heading:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;body background="pics/vertical_fountain.gif"&gt;</TT>
<tt>&lt;h3&gt;</TT>Kumquat Lore<tt>&lt;/h3&gt;</TT>
For centuries, many myths and legends have arisen around the kumquat.
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
If the <i class=emphasis>vertical_fountain.gif</I> is a narrow, tall
image whose color grows lighter towards its base and whose length
exceeds the length of the document body, the resulting document might
look like the one shown in <a href="#USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-19">Figure 5-19</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-19">Figure 5-19: A tall and skinny background</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/uhtml0519.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-19]" width=500 height=252>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
You can achieve a similar effect horizontally with an image that is
much wider than it is long (<a href="#USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-20">Figure 5-20</A>).

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-20">Figure 5-20: A long and skinny background</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/uhtml0520.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-20]" width=500 height=252>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.3">The bgproperties attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
 
 
The bgproperties attribute extension for the
<tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag is exclusive to Internet Explorer and only
works in conjunction with the background attribute
extension. The bgproperties attribute has a single
value, <tt class=literal>fixed</tt>. It freezes the background image to
the browser window, so it does not scroll with the other window
contents. Hence, the example <i class=emphasis>H2Omark.gif</I> background
image servers as a watermark for the document:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;body background="pics/H2Omark.gif" bgproperties="fixed"&gt;</TT>
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.4">The text attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
 
 
Once you alter a document's background color or add a background
image, you also might need to adjust the text color to ensure that
users can read the text. The text attribute for the
<tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag does just that: it sets the color of all
nonanchor text in the entire document.

<p class=para>
Give the text attribute a color value in the same
format as you use to specify a background color (see
bgcolor above)--an RGB
triplet or color name, as described in <a href="appe_01.htm">Appendix E</A>. For example, to produce a document with
blue text on a pale yellow background, use:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;body bgcolor="#777700" text="blue"&gt;</TT>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
Of course, it's best to select a text color that contrasts well with your background color or image.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.5">The link, vlink, and alink attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
 
 
 
 
 
 
The link, vlink, and
alink attributes of the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag
control the color of hypertext (<tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag) in your
documents. All three accept values that specify a color as an
RGB triplet or color name, just like the
text and bgcolor attributes.

<p class=para>
The link attribute determines the color of all
hyperlinks the user has not yet followed. The vlink
attribute sets the color of all links the extended browser user
had followed at one time or another. The alink
attribute defines a color for active link text--one that is
currently selected by the user and is under the mouse cursor with the
mouse button depressed.

<p class=para>
Interestingly, Netscape is the only browser that actually defines a
separate color for alink text, so it's the
only browser for which the alink attribute to the
<tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag applies; the others, including Internet
Explorer, ignore it.

<p class=para>
Like text color, you should be careful to select link colors that can
be read against the document background. Moreover, the link colors
should be different from the regular text as well as from each other.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.6">The leftmargin attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
 
 

Peculiar to Internet Explorer, the leftmargin attribute extension for the
<tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag lets you indent the left margin relative
to the left edge of the browser's window, much like a margin on
a sheet of paper. Other browsers ignore this attribute and normally
left-justified body content abuts the left edge of the document
window.

<p class=para>
The value of the leftmargin
attribute is the integer number of pixels for that left-margin indent;
a value of 0 is the default. The margin is filled with the background
color or image.

<p class=para>
For example, Internet Explorer renders the following text justified
against a margin 50 pixels away from the left edge of the browser
window (<a href="#USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-21">Figure 5-21</A>):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;body leftmargin=50&gt;</TT>
Internet Explorer lets you indent the<tt>&lt;br&gt;</TT>
&amp;lt;--left margin<tt>&lt;br&gt;</TT>
away from the left edge of the window. 
<tt>&lt;/body&gt;</TT>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-21">Figure 5-21: Internet Explorer's leftmargin attribute for indenting body content</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/uhtml0521.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-21]" width=500 height=145>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.7">The topmargin attribute</A></h4>

<p class=para>
 
 
Like leftmargin, the topmargin attribute extension currently is
exclusive to Internet Explorer. It may be included in the
<tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag to set a margin of space at the top of the
document. The margin space is filled with the document's
background color or image.

<p class=para>
Body content begins flowing below the integer number of pixels you
specify as the value for topmargin; a value of 0 is
the default.

<p class=para>
For example, Internet Explorer renders the following text at least 50
pixels down from the top edge of the browser window (<a href="#USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-22">Figure 5-22</A>):

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;body topmargin=50&gt;</TT>
<tt>&lt;center&gt;</TT>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<tt>&lt;/center&gt;</TT>
Internet Explorer can give your documents 
a little extra headroom. 
<tt>&lt;/body&gt;</TT>
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-22">Figure 5-22: Internet Explorer's topmargin attribute for lowering body content</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/uhtml0522.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-22]" width=500 height=156>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.8">Mixing and matching body attributes</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Although background and bgcolor attributes can appear in the same
<tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag, a background image will effectively hide
the selected background color unless the image contains substantial
portions of transparent color, as we described earlier in this
chapter. But even if the image does hide the background color, go
ahead and include the bgcolor
attribute and some appropriate color value. That's because users
can turn off image downloading, which includes background images, and
so they may find your page otherwise left naked and
unappealing. Moreover, without a bgcolor attribute or a downloaded (for
whatever reason) background image, the extended browsers merrily
ignore your text and link color attributes, too, reverting instead to
its own default values, or the ones chosen by the user.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.2">Extending a Warning</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The various color and image extensions work wonderfully, particularly
the colorful ones, assuming that all users have a 256-color display,
lots of available memory, unlimited network bandwidth, and good visual
acuity. In reality, many users have monochrome or limited color
displays, limited memory for caching images, extremely restricted
network bandwidth, and poor vision.

<p class=para>
Because of these limitations, you should seriously consider not using
any of these extensions in your documents. Much like early users of
the Macintosh felt compelled to create documents using ransom-note
typography (``I've got 40 fonts on this thing, and
I'm going to use them all!''), many authors of Netscape- or
Internet Explorer-specific documents cannot avoid adding some sort of
textured background to every document they create (``I've
got 13 wood grains and 22 kinds of marbling, and
I'm going to use them all!'').

<p class=para>
In reality, except for the very clever ones, texture-mapped
backgrounds add no information to your documents. The value of your
document ultimately lies in its text and imagery, not the cheesy blue
swirly pattern in the background. No matter how cool it looks, your
readers are not benefiting and could be losing readability.

<p class=para>
We advise you not to use the color extensions except for comparatively
frivolous endeavors or unless the extension really adds to the
document's value, such as for business advertising and marketing
pages.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.2.1">Problems with background images</A></h4>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH05.COLORP"></A>Here are some of the things that can go wrong with background images:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>The time to load the document is increased by the amount of
time needed to load the image. Until the background image is
completely downloaded, no further document rendering is possible.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The background image takes up room in the browser's
local cache, displacing other images that might actually contain
useful information. This makes other documents, which might not even
have backgrounds, take that much longer to load.

<p>
<li class=listitem>The colors in the image may not be available on the user's
display, forcing the browser to dither the image. This replaces large
areas of a single color with repeating patterns of several other
closer, but not cleaner, colors and can make the text more
difficult to read.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Because the browser must actually
display an image in the background, as opposed to filling an area with
a single color, scrolling through the document can take much longer.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Even if it's clear onscreen, text printed on top of an image
invariably is more difficult if not impossible to read.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Fonts vary widely between machines; the ones you use with your browser
that work fine with a background pattern often end up jagged and
difficult to read on another machine.

<p>
</UL>
</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.2.2">Problems with background, text, and link colors</A></h4>

<p class=para>
There also are a slew of problems you will encounter if you play with
background colors, including:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>
The color you choose, while just lovely in your eyes, may look
terrible to the user. Why annoy them by changing what users most
likely have already set as their own default background color?
<p>
<li class=listitem>
While you may be a member of the ``light text on a dark
background'' school of document design, many people also favor
the ``dark text on a light background'' style that has been
consistently popular for over three thousand years. Instead of bucking
the trend, assume that the user has already set their browser to a
comfortable color scheme.
<p>
<li class=listitem>
Some users are color-blind. What may be a nifty-looking combination of
colors to you, may be completely unreadable to others. One combination
in particular to avoid is green for unvisited links and red for
visited links. Millions of men are afflicted with red/green color
blindness.
<p>
<li class=listitem>
Your brilliant hue may not be available on the user's display,
and the browser may be forced to choose one that's close
instead. For displays with very few colors (like those of several
million 16-color VGA Windows-based machines
currently in use) the close colors for the text and the background
might be the same color!
<p>
<li class=listitem>
For the same reasons above, active, unvisited, and visited links may
all wind up the same color on limited-color displays.
<p>
<li class=listitem>
By changing text colors, particularly those for visited and unvisited
links, you may completely confuse the user. By changing those colors,
you effectively force them to experiment with your page, clicking a
few links here and there to learn your color scheme.
<p>
<li class=listitem>
Most page designers have no formal training in either cognitive
psychology, fine arts, graphic arts, or industrial design, yet feel
fully capable of selecting appropriate colors for their documents. If
you must fiddle with the colors, ask a professional to pick them for
you.

<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.2.3">And, then again</A></h4>

<p class=para>
There is no denying the fact that these extensions result in some very
stunning HTML documents. And they are fun to
explore and play with. So, rather than leave this chapter on a sour
note of caution, we encourage you to go ahead and play: just play
carefully.
