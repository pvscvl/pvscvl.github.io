<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH06-SECT-4">6.4 Creating Effective Links</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH06.LINKS3"></A><a name="CH06.LINKS4"></A>A document becomes hypertext by tossing in a few links in the same way
that water becomes soup when you throw in a few
vegetables. Technically, you've met the goal, but the outcome
may not be very palatable.

<p class=para>
Inserting anchors into your documents is something of an art,
requiring good writing skills, HTML prowess, and an
architectural sense of your documents and their relationships to
others on the Web. Effective links flow seamlessly into a document,
quietly supplying additional browsing opportunities to the reader
without disturbing the current document. Poorly designed links scream
out, interrupt the flow of the source document, and generally annoy
the reader.

<p class=para>
While there are as many linking styles as there are authors, here are
a few of the more popular ways to link your documents. All do two
things: they give the reader quick access to related information, and
they tell the reader how the link is related to the current contents.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH06-SECT-4.1">Lists of Links</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH06.LISTS"></A>Perhaps the most common way to present hyperlinks in
HTML documents is in ordered or unordered lists in
the style of a table of contents or list of resources.

<p class=para>
Two schools of style exist: One puts the entire list item into the
source anchor; the other abbreviates the item and puts a shorthand
phrase in the source anchor. In the former, make sure you keep the
anchor content short and sweet; in the latter, use a direct writing
style that makes it easy to embed the link.

<p class=para>
If your list of links becomes overly long, consider organizing it into
several sublists grouped by topic. Readers can then scan the topics
(set off, perhaps, as <tt>&lt;h3&gt;</TT> headers) for the
appropriate list and then scan that list for the desired document.

<p class=para>
The alternative list style is much more descriptive, but also more
wordy, so you have to be careful it doesn't end up
cluttered:

<p class=para>

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</TT>
Kumquat-related documents include:
<tt>&lt;ul&gt;</TT>
  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</TT>A concise guide to <tt>&lt;a href="kumquat_farming.html"&gt;</TT> 
      profitable kumquat farming<tt>&lt;/a&gt;</TT>,
      including a variety of business plans, lists of fruit
      packing companies, and farming supply companies.
  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</TT>101 different ways to <tt>&lt;a href="kumquat_uses"&gt;</TT> 
      use a kumquat<tt>&lt;/a&gt;</TT>, including stewed kumquats and kumquat pie!
  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</TT>The kumquat is a hardy tree, but even the greenest of
      thumbs can use a few <tt>&lt;a href="news:alt.kumquat_growers"&gt;</TT>
      growing tips<tt>&lt;/a&gt;</TT> to increase
      their yield.
  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</TT>The business of kumquats is an expanding one, as
      shown by this 10 year overview of the 
      <tt>&lt;a href="http://www.ora.com/kumquat_report/"&gt;</TT>
      kumquat industry<tt>&lt;/a&gt;</TT>.
<tt>&lt;/ul&gt;</TT>
</PRE>
</DIV>


<p class=para>
It sometimes gets hard to read a source
HTML document. Imagine the clutter if
we'd used anchors with fragment identifiers for each of the
subtopics in the list item explanations. Nonetheless, it all looks
pristine and easily navigable when displayed by the browser, such as
with Mosaic as shown in <a href="#USING-HTML-CH06-FIG-3">Figure 6-3</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH06-FIG-3">Figure 6-3: Wordy but effectively descriptive link list</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/uhtml0603.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 6-3]" width=500 height=207>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
This more descriptive style of presenting a link list tries hard to
draw readers into the linked document by giving a fuller
taste of what they can expect to find. Because each list element
is longer and requires more scanning by the reader, you should use
this style sparingly and dramatically limit the number of links.

<p class=para>
In general, use the brief list style when presenting large numbers of
links to a well-informed audience. The second, more descriptive style
is better suited to a smaller number of links for which your readership
is less well-versed in the topic at hand.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH06-SECT-4.2">Inline References</A></h3>

<p class=para>
If you aren't collecting links into lists, you're probably
sprinkling them throughout your document. So-called inline links are
more in keeping with the true spirit of hypertext since they enable
the reader to mark their current place in the document, visit the
related topic in more depth or find a better explanation, and then
come back to the original and continue reading. That's very
personalized information processing.

<p class=para>
The biggest mistake made by novice HTML authors,
however, is to overload their documents with links and treat them as
if they are panic buttons demanding to be pressed. You may have seen
this style of linking; HTML pages with
the word ``here'' all over the place, like the panic-ridden
example in <a href="#USING-HTML-CH06-FIG-4">Figure 6-4</A> (we can't
bring ourselves to show you the source HTML for
this travesty).

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH06-FIG-4">Figure 6-4: Links should not wave and yell like first-graders, ``Here! Me! Me!''</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/uhtml0604.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 6-4]" width=500 height=153>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
As links, phrases like ``click here'' and ``also
available'' are content-free and annoying. They make the person
who is scanning the page for an important link read all the
surrounding text to actually find the reference.

<p class=para>
The better, more refined style for an inline link is to make every one contain a noun or noun/verb phrase relating to the topic at hand. Compare how kumquat farming and industry news references are treated in the 
<a href="#USING-HTML-CH06-FIG-5">Figure 6-5</A> to the ``Here! Me! Me!'' example in <a href="#USING-HTML-CH06-FIG-4">Figure 6-4</A>.

<div class=figure>
<h4 class=figure><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH06-FIG-5">Figure 6-5: Kinder, gentler inline links work best</A></h4>


<p>
<img align=middle src="figs/uhtml0605.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 6-5]" width=500 height=148>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
A quick scan of <a href="#USING-HTML-CH06-FIG-5">Figure 6-5</A> immediately
yields useful links to ``kumquat farming'' and
``industry's past ten years.'' There is no need to
read the surrounding text to understand where the link will take
you. Indeed, the immediately surrounding content in our example, as
for most inline links, serves only as syntactic sugar in support of
the embedded links.

<p class=para>
Embedding links into the general discourse of a document takes more
effort to create than link lists. You've got to actually
understand the content of the current as well as the target documents,
be able to express that relationship in just a few words, and then
intelligently incorporate that link at some key place in the source
document. Hopefully this key place is where you might expect the user
is ready to interrupt their reading and ask a question or request more
information. To make matters even more difficult, particularly for the
traditional tech writer, this form of author-reader conversation is
most effective when presented in active voice (he, she, or it does
something to an object versus the object having something done to
it). The effort expended is worthwhile, though, resulting in more
informative, easily read documents. Remember, you'll write the
document once, but it will be read thousands, if not millions, of
times. Please your readers, please.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH06-SECT-4.3">Linking Do's and Don'ts</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Here are some hints for creating links:
<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Keep the link content as concise as possible. Long links or huge inline graphic icons for links are visually disruptive and potentially confusing.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Never place two links immediately adjacent to one another. Most browsers make it difficult to tell where one link stops and the next link starts. Separate them with regular text or line breaks.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Be consistent. If you are using inline references, make all of your links inline references. If you choose to use lists of links, stick to either the short or long form; don't mix styles in a single document.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Try reading your document with all the nonanchor text removed. If some links suddenly make no sense, rewrite them so that they stand on their own. (Many people scan documents looking only for links; the surrounding text becomes little more than a gray background to the more visually compelling links.)

<p>
</UL>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH06-SECT-4.4">Using Images and Links</A></h3>

<p class=para>
It has become fashionable to use images and icons instead of words for
link contents. For instance, instead of the word ``next,''
some HTML authors might use an icon of a little
pointing hand. A link to the home page is not complete without a
picture of a little house. Links to searching tools must now contain a
picture of a magnifying glass, question mark, or binoculars.

<p class=para>
Resist falling prey to the ``Mount Everest syndrome'' of
inserting images simply because you can. Again, it's a matter of
context. If you or your document's readers can't tell at a
glance what relationship a link has with the current document,
you've failed. Use cute images for links sparingly,
consistently, and only in ways that help readers scan your document
for important information and leads. Also be ever mindful that your
pages may be read by someone from nearly anywhere on Earth (perhaps
beyond, even), and that images do not translate consistently across
cultural boundaries. (Ever hear what the ``okay'' hand sign
common in the United States means to a Japanese person?)

<p class=para>
Creating consistent iconography for a collection of pages is a
daunting task, one that really should be done with the assistance of
someone formally schooled in visual design. Trust us, the kind of mind
that produces nifty code and does good HTML is
rarely suited to creating beautiful, compelling imagery. Find a
good visual designer; your pages and readers will benefit
immeasurably.
