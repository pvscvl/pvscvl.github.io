<a name="CH09.TABLES"></A>You may wonder, given HTML's deep roots in
academia, why the language standard doesn't include any explicit
support for data tables. None at all[1]
 for a community steeped in mountains of data. And, that's just
 the academic community. Tables are an age-old respected means for
 cross-comparing items of information for all types of endeavors.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
The <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</TT> tag, although capable, is hardly
``support'' for tables.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
Fortunately, the developers of the popular graphical browsers,
including Netscape, Internet Explorer, and Mosaic, have stepped into
the breach and come up with a fairly comprehensive set of
HTML extensions for tables. In fact, they have
eclipsed the Web standards organization devoted to
HTML by including many of the table-handling
features intended for inclusion in HTML
version 3.2.
<p class=para>
While it is relatively easy to swear off many of the other extensions
to HTML, like frivolous background images or
auto-scrolling text marquees, you simply will not be able to resist
the siren call of the table extensions. They're just too useful
to ignore.
<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH09-SECT-1">9.1 The HTML Table Model</A></h2>

<p class=para>
The model the extended browsers use for tables is fairly
straightforward: tables are collections of numbers and words arranged
and related in rows and columns of <i class=emphasis>cells</I>. Most
cells contain the data values; others contain row and column headers
that describe the data.
<p class=para>

You define a table and include all of its elements between the
<tt>&lt;table&gt;</TT> tag and its corresponding
<tt>&lt;/table&gt;</TT> end tag. Table elements, including data
items, row and column headers, and captions, each have their own
markup tag. Working from left to right and top to bottom, you define,
in sequence, the header and data for each column cell across the
table, and progress down row by row.
<p class=para>

The latest browsers also support a collection of tag attributes that make your tables look good, including special alignment of the table values and headers, borders and table rule lines, and automatic sizing of the data cells to accommodate their content. Netscape and Internet Explorer each have a slightly richer set of attributes than Mosaic; we'll point out those variations as we go.
<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH09-SECT-1.1">Table Contents</A></h3>

<p class=para>

You may put nearly anything you might put within the body of an
HTML document inside a table cell, including
images, forms, rules, headings, and even another table. The browser
treats each cell as a window unto itself, flowing the
cell's content to fill the space, but with some special
formatting provisions and extensions.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH09-SECT-1.2">An Example Table</A></h3>

<p class=para>

Here's a quick example that should satisfy your itching
curiosity to see what an HTML table looks like in
source code and when finally rendered as in <a href="#USING-HTML-CH09-FIG-1">Figure 9-1</A>. More importantly, it shows you the
basic structure of a table from which you can infer many of the
elements, tag syntax and order, attributes, and so on, and to which
you may refer back as you read the various detailed descriptions
below:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;table border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5&gt;
  &lt;caption align=bottom&gt; Kumquat versus a poked 
  eye, by gender&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td colspan=2 rowspan=2&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;th colspan=2 align=center&gt;Preference&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Eating Kumquats&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Poke In The Eye&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr align=center&gt;
    &lt;th rowspan=2&gt;Gender&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Male&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;73%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;27%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr align=center&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Female&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;84%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH09-SECT-1.3">Missing Features</A></h3>

<p class=para>

HTML tables currently don't have all the
features of a full-fledged table-generation tool you might find in a
popular word processor. Rather than leave you in suspense, we'll
list those things up front so you don't beat your head against
the wall later trying to do something that just can't be done
(at least, not yet):
<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>
Most browsers, save for Internet Explorer and the latest version of
Netscape Navigator (2.0), don't flow text around a table as they
do for images. Rather, they isolate a table from the text content with
line breaks. The table does inherit the alignment of the current text
flow--normally left-justified as with regular text, or
center-justified, if contained within the <tt>&lt;center&gt;</TT>
tag. <i class=emphasis>[<tt>&lt;center&gt;</TT>, <a href="ch04_07.htm">4.7.6</A>]</I>

<p>
<li class=listitem>The general problem of text alignment in HTML
carries over into tables. You may align values inside their individual
cells, but you cannot align them between cells. For instance, you
cannot vertically align the decimal points in a column of numbers,
even though they all might have the same number of digits.

<p>
<li class=listitem> 
Mosaic's table border and rule lines are all or nothing; either
you include them or you don't. Netscape and Internet Explorer,
on the other hand, give you the ability to set their thickness, but
you get to use only one size line for the table's borders and
rules, if you choose to include them at all. You can't have a
thicker border separate the table headings from the table body, for
example, or have a heavier border between rows at regular
intervals. Nor can you have a different-sized outside border.

<p>
<li class=listitem>HTML tables don't have running headers or
footers. Of course, such things don't matter with an
HTML browser where everything is on a single,
infinitely long page. Running headers and footers are nice to have,
though, when you print out a long table onto separate sheets of paper.
