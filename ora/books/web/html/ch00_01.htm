<p class=para>
Learning HTML is like learning any new language,
computer or human. Most students first immerse themselves in
examples. Think how adept you'd become if Mom, Dad, your brothers, and
sisters all spoke fluent HTML. Studying others is a
natural way to learn, making learning easy and fun. Our advice to
anyone wanting to learn HTML is to get out there on
the World Wide Web with a suitable browser and see for yourself what
looks good, what's effective, what works for you. Examine others'
HTML source files and ponder the
possibilities. Mimicry is how many of the current webmasters have
learned the language.

<p class=para>
Imitation can take you only so far, though. Examples can be both good
and bad. Learning by example will help you talk the talk, but not walk
the walk. To become truly conversant, you must learn how to use the
language well and how to use the language appropriately in many
different situations. You could learn that by example, if you live
long enough.

<p class=para>
Remember, too, that computer-based languages are more explicit
than human languages. You've got to get the HTML
syntax correct, or it won't work. Then, too, there is the problem
of ``standards.'' Committees of academics and industry
experts try to define the proper syntax and usage of a computer
language like HTML. The problem is that
HTML browser manufacturers like Netscape and Spyglass choose what parts of the standard they
will use and which parts they'll ignore. They even make up their own
parts, which may eventually become standards.

<p class=para>
To be safe, the better way to become HTML fluent is
through a comprehensive language reference: a resource that covers the
language syntax, semantics, and variations in detail, and helps you
distinguish between good and bad usage.

<p class=para>
There's one more step leading to fluency in a language. To become a
true master of HTML, you need to develop your own
style. That means knowing what's not only appropriate, but what is
effective. Layout matters. A lot. So does the order of presentation
within a document, between documents, and between document
collections.

<p class=para>
Our goal in writing this book is to help you become fluent in
HTML, fully versed in the language's syntax,
semantics, and elements of style. We take the natural learning
approach with examples: good ones, of course. We cover every
element of the currently accepted version (2.0)[1] 
 of the language in
detail, as well as many of the so-called ``extensions''
the popular HTML browsers support, explaining how
each element works and how it interacts with all the other elements.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
Contrary to popular misbelief, there is no HTML
version 3.0. See "Is HTML 3.2 Really a Big Deal?" later in
this Preface.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
And, with all due respect to Strunk and White, throughout the book we
give you suggestions for style and composition to help you decide how
best to use the language and accomplish a variety of tasks, from
simple online documentation to complex marketing and sales
presentations. We'll show you what works and what doesn't; what makes
sense to those who view your pages, and what might be confusing.

<p class=para>
In short, this book is a complete guide to creating documents using
HTML, starting with basic syntax and semantics, and
finishing with broad style directions that should help you create
beautiful, informative, accessible documents you'll be proud to
deliver to your browsers.
