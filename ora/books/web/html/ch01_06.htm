<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6">1.6 Tools for the HTML Designer</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.DESIGN"></A>While you can use the barest of barebones text editors to create
HTML documents, most HTML
authors have a bit more elaborate toolbox of software utilities than a
simple word processor. You also need, at least, a browser so you can
test and refine your work. Beyond the essentials are some software
tools specialized for HTML document preparation and
editing, and others for developing and preparing accessory multimedia
files.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6.1">Essentials</A></h3>

<p class=para>
At the very least, you'll need an editor, a browser to check your
work, and ideally, a connection to the Internet.

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6.1.1">Word processor or HTML editor?</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Some authors use the word-processing capabilities of their specialized
HTML editing software. Others, such as ourselves,
prefer to compose their work on a general word processor and later
insert the HTML tags and their attributes. Still
others embed HTML tags as they compose.

<p class=para>
We think the stepwise approach--compose, then mark up--is
the better way. Word processors typically have more and better writing
tools, such as an outliner, spell-checker, and thesaurus, so you can
craft the document's flow and content well, disregarding for the
moment its look. We find that once we've defined and written the
document's content, it's much easier to make a second pass to
judiciously and effectively add the HTML tags to
format the text. Note, too, that, unless specially trained (if they
can be), spell-checkers and thesauruses typically choke on
HTML markup tags and their various parameters. You
can spend what seems to be a lifetime clicking the ignore button on
all those otherwise valid markup tags when syntax- or spell-checking
an HTML document.

<p class=para>
When and how you embed HTML tags into your document
dictate the tools you need. Some word processors, such as WordPerfect
or Microsoft Word, come with automated tools, and there are
third-party ones, too, that automatically translate your
word-processed documents into HTML. Don't expect
miracles, though. Except for boilerplate documents, you probably will
need to nurse those automated HTML documents to
full health.

<p class=para>
Another word of caution about HTML editors: Not all
adhere to the HTML 2.0 standard, so examine their
specifications before using, and certainly before purchasing,
one. Moreover, some of the WYSIWYG
(what-you-see-is-what-you-get) HTML editors don't
have up-to-date built-in browsers, so they may erroneously decode the
HTML tags and give you misleading displays.

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6.1.2">Browser software</A></h4>

<p class=para>
Obviously, you should view your newly composed HTML
documents and test their functionality before you release them for use
by others. For serious HTML authors, particularly
those looking to push their documents beyond the
HTML standards, we recommend that you have several
browser products, perhaps with versions running on different
computers, just to be sure one's delightful display isn't another's
nightmare.

<p class=para>
The currently popular, and so most important, browsers are Netscape
Navigator, Mosaic, and Internet Explorer. Sun's HotJava, although
still in alpha testing state, is expected by some to have a bright
future. Obtain free copies of the software via anonymous
FTP from their respective servers (ftp.netscape.com, ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, ftp.microsoft.com, and ftp.java.com), or contact
your local computer software dealer for a commercial version (about
$50).

</DIV>

<div class=sect3>
<h4 class=sect3><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6.1.3">Internet connection</A></h4>

<p class=para>
We think you should have bona fide access to the Internet if you are
really serious about learning and honing your HTML
writing skills. Okay, it's not absolutely essential since you can
compose and view HTML documents locally. And for
some, a connection is perhaps not even possible or practical, but make
the effort; there's sometimes no better way to learn than by
example. HTML examples abound on the Internet, both
good and bad, whose source HTML you can download
and examine.

<p class=para>
Moreover, an Internet connection <i class=emphasis>is</I> essential for
development and testing if you include hypertext links to Internet
services in your HTML documents. But, most of all,
an Internet connection gives you access to a wealth of tips and
ongoing updates to the language through special-interest newsgroups,
as well as much of the essential and accessory software you can use to
prepare HTML document collections.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6.2">An Extended Toolkit</A></h3>

<p class=para>
If you're serious about creating documents, you'll soon find
there are all sorts of nifty tools that make life easier. The list of
freeware, shareware, and commercial products grows daily, so it's not
very useful to provide a list here. This is, in fact, another good
reason why you should get an Internet connection; various groups keep
updated lists of HTML resources on the Web. If you
are really dedicated to writing in HTML, you will
visit those sites, and you will visit them regularly to keep abreast
of the language, tools, and trends.

<p class=para>
<a href="#USING-HTML-CH01-TAB-1">Table 1.1</A> summarizes the most useful
HTML author resources currently on the Web. Each
contains dozens, sometimes hundreds, of hyperlinks to detailed
descriptions of products and other important information for the
HTML author. Go at it.
