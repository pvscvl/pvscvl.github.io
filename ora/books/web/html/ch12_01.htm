<p class=para>
We've sprinkled a number of tips, tricks, and hacks throughout
this book, along with style guidelines, examples, and instructions. So
why have a special chapter on tips, tricks, and hacks of
HTML? Because it's where most readers will
leaf to when they pick up this book for the first
time. HTML is the language, albeit constrained,
that makes the World Wide Web on the Internet the exciting place that
it is. And interested readers want to know, ``How do I do
the cool stuff?''

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH12-SECT-1">12.1 Top of the Tips</A></h2>

<p class=para>
The most important tip for even veteran
HTML authors, and one that bears repeating, is surf
for yourself. We can show and explain a few neat tricks to get you
started, but there are thousands of HTML authors
out there combining and recombining HTML tags and
juggling content to create compelling and useful documents.

<p class=para>
Get a bona fide Internet account; get a copy of Mosaic, Netscape,
Internet Explorer, whatever; get connected; and get cruising. Collect
Web site URLs from friends, business associates,
and the traditional media. Even local TV and radio stations have taken
to announcing some of their sponsors' Web site
URLs. And consult the many different Internet Web
directories like Yahoo and Webcrawler for new and up-to-date addresses
for the Web sites that suit your lifestyle or business niche.

<p class=para>
Examine (don't steal) their pages for eye-catching and effective
pages and use them to guide your own creations. Capture and examine
the source HTML documents for the juicy bits. Get a
feel of the more effective Web collections. How are their
documents organized? How large is each document? And so on.

<p class=para>
We all learn from experience, so go get it.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH12-SECT-1.1">Design for Your Audience</A></h3>

<p class=para>
We continuously argue throughout the book that, with
HTML documents, content matters most, not
look. That doesn't mean presentation doesn't matter.

<p class=para>
Effective HTML documents match your target
audience's expectations, giving them a familiar environment in
which to explore and gather information. Serious academicians expect a
treatise on the physiology of the kumquat to appear
journal-like: long on meaningful words, figures, and diagrams;
short on frivolous trappings like cute bullets and font
abuse. Don't insult the reader's eye, except when
exercising artistic license to jar or attack your reader's
sensibilities.

<p class=para>
By anticipating your audience and by designing your documents to appeal to their tastes, you also subtly deflect unwanted surfers from your pages. Undesirables, such as penniless college students surfing your commercial site, may hog your server's resources and prevent the buying audience you desire from ready access to your pages.

<p class=para>
For instance, use subtle colors and muted text transitions between sections for a classical art museum's collection to mimic the hushed environment of a real classical art museum. The typical rock-n-roll crazed Web surfer maniac probably won't spend more than a glance at your site, but the millionaire arts patron might.

<p class=para>
Also, use effective layout to gently guide your readers' eyes to areas of interest in your documents. Do that by adhering to the basic rules of document layout and design, such as placing figures and diagrams nearby if not inline with their content reference. Nothing's worse than having to scroll up and down the browser window in a desperate search for a picture that can explain everything.

<p class=para>
We won't lie and suggest that we're design experts. We aren't, but they're not hard to find. So, another tip for the serious Web page author: Seek professional help. The best situation is to have design experience yourself. Next best is to have a pro looking over your shoulder, or at least somewhere within earshot.

<p class=para>
Make a trip to your local library and do some reading on your own,
too. Even better yet, browse the various online
HTML guides. Check out <i class=emphasis>Designing for the
Web</I> by O'Reilly &amp; Associates. Your readers will be glad
you did. <i class=emphasis>[design tools, <a href="ch01_06.htm">1.6</A>]</I>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH12-SECT-1.2">Boilerplate HTML Documents</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The next best tip we can give you is reuse your documents. Don't
start from scratch each time. Rather, develop a consistent framework,
even to the point of a content outline into which you add the detail
and character for each page.

<p class=para>
Here's our contribution to help start your boilerplate
HTML document collection. The following source
contains what the HTML standard currently tells us
is the minimum content that should appear in every
HTML document (regardless of what the browsers
might let you get away with) and then some added for document
clarity. Use it as a skeleton for your own HTML
documents:

<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Required--replace this title with your own&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reiterate the title here&lt;/h3&gt;
...Insert your document's contents here...
&lt;address&gt;Include your name and contact information
usually at the end of the document&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</PRE>
