<a name="CH03.HTMLDOCS"></A>HTML documents are very simple and writing one
shouldn't intimidate even the most timid of computer users. First,
although you might use a fancy WYSIWYG editor to
help you compose it, an HTML document ultimately is
stored, distributed, and read by a browser as a simple
ASCII text file.[1]
That's why even the poorest user with a barebones text editor can
compose the most elaborate of HTML
pages. (Accomplished webmasters often elicit the admiration of
HTML ``newbies'' by composing
astonishingly cool pages using the crudest text editor on a cheap
laptop computer and performing in odd places like on a bus or in the
bathroom.) HTML writers should, however, keep
several of the popular browsers on hand and alternate among them to
view new documents under construction. Remember, browsers differ in
how they display a page, not all browsers implement all of the
HTML standards, and some have their own special
extensions to the language.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
Informally, both the text and the markup tags in an
HTML document are ASCII
characters. Technically, unless you specify otherwise, text and tags
are made up of eight-bit characters as defined in the standard
ISO-8859-1 Latin character set. The HTML standard
does support alternative character encodings, including Arabic and
Cyrillic. See <a href="appd_01.htm">Appendix D, <i>Character Entities</i></A>, for details.

<p class=para>
HTML documents never look alike when
displayed by a text editor and when displayed by an
HTML browser. Simply take a look at any source
HTML document off the World Wide Web. At the very
least, return characters, tabs, and leading spaces, although important
for readability of the source text document, are for the most part
ignored in HTML. There also is a lot of extra text
in an HTML source document, mostly from the 
display
tags and interactivity markers and their parameters that affect
portions of the document, but don't themselves appear in the display.
<p class=para>
 Accordingly, new HTML authors are
confronted with having to develop not only a presentation style for
their HTML pages, but a different style for their
HTML source text. The source document's layout
should highlight the programming-like markup aspects of
HTML, not its display aspects. And it should be
readable not only by you, the author, but by others, as well.
<p class=para>
 Experienced HTML document writers
typically adopt a programming-like style, albeit very relaxed, for
their source HTML text. We do the same throughout
the book, and that style will become apparent as you compare our
source HTML examples with the actual display of the
document by a browser.
<p class=para>
Our formatting style is simple, but serves to create readable, easily
maintained documents:

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>Except for the document structural tags like <tt>&lt;html&gt;</TT>,
<tt>&lt;head&gt;</TT>, and <tt>&lt;body&gt;</TT>, any
HTML element we used to structure the content
of a document is placed on a separate line and indented to show its
nesting level within the document.  Such elements include lists,
forms, tables, and similar tags.

<p>
<li class=listitem>Any HTML element used to control the
appearance or style of text is inserted in the current line of
text.  This includes basic font style tags like <tt>&lt;b&gt;</TT>
(bold text) and document linkages like <tt>&lt;a&gt;</TT> (hypertext
anchor).

<p>
<li class=listitem>Avoid, where possible, the breaking of a URL
onto two lines. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>Add extraneous
newline characters to set apart special sections of the
HTML document, for instance around paragraphs or
tables.

<p>
</UL>
<p class=para>
The task of maintaining the indentation of your source
HTML ranges from trivial to onerous. Some text
editors like Emacs manage the indentation automatically; others like
common word processors couldn't care less about indentation and leave
the task completely up to you. If your editor makes your life
difficult, you might consider striking a compromise, perhaps by
indenting the tags to show structure, but leaving the actual text
without indentation to make modifications easier.
<p class=para>
 No matter what compromises or stands you make on source
code style, however, it's important that you adopt one. You'll be very
glad you did when you go back to that HTML document
you wrote three months ago searching for that really cool trick you
did with.... Now, where was that?
