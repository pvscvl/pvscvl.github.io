<p class=para>
We did not compose, and certainly could not have composed this book without
generous contributions from many people. Our wives Jeanne and Cindy
(with whom we've just become reacquainted) and our young children Eva,
Ethan, Courtney, and Cole (they happened <i class=emphasis>before</I>
we started writing) formed the front lines of support. And there are
numerous neighbors, friends, and colleagues who helped by sharing
ideas, testing browsers, and letting us use their equipment to explore
HTML. You know who you are, and we thank you
all. (Ed Bond, we'll be over soon to repair your Windows.)

<p class=para>
We also thank our technical reviewers, Kane Scarlett, Eric Raymond,
and Chris Tacy, for carefully scrutinizing our work. We took most of
your keen suggestions. And we especially thank Mike Loukides, our
editor, who had to bring to bear his vast experience in book
publishing to keep us two mavericks corralled.

<p class=para>
And, finally, we thank the many people at O'Reilly &amp; Associates who
poked our words into sensibility and put them onto these pages. These
folks include: Mary Anne Weeks Mayo, project manager/copyeditor for
the book; Len Muellner, Ellen Siever, and Erik Ray converted the book
from Word for Windows to SGML and contributed their
tool-tweaking prowess; Chris Reilley created the excellent figures;
Edie Freedman designed the cover; Nancy Priest designed the interior
layout; Hanna Dyer designed the back cover; Seth Maislin prepared the
index; and Sheryl Avruch, Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary, and Kismet McDonough
Chan did the final quality control on the book.
