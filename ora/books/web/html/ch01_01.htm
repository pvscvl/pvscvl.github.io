Though it began as a military experiment and spent its adolescence as
a sandbox for academics and eccentrics, recent events have transformed
the worldwide network of computer networks--aka the
Internet--into a rapidly growing and wildly diversified community
of computer users and information vendors. Today, you can bump into
Internet users of nearly any and all nationalities, of any and all
persuasions, from serious to frivolous individuals, from businesses to
nonprofit organizations, and from born-again evangelists to
pornographers.

<p class=para>
In many ways, the World Wide Web--the open community of
hypertext-enabled document servers and readers on the
Internet--is responsible for the meteoric rise in the network's
popularity. You, too, can become a valued member by contributing:
writing HTML documents and making them available to
Web ``surfers'' worldwide.

<p class=para>
Let's climb up the Internet family tree to gain some deeper insight
into its magnificence, not only as an exercise of curiosity, but to
help us better understand just who and what it is we are dealing with
when we go online.

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-1">1.1 The Internet</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.INTERNET"></A>Although popular media accounts often are confused and confusing, the
concept of the <i class=emphasis>Internet</I> really is rather simple.
It's a collection of networks--a network of networks--computers
sharing digital information via a common set of networking and
software protocols. Nearly anyone can connect their computer to the
Internet and immediately communicate with other computers and users on the
Net.

<p class=para>
What is confusing about the Internet is that it can be like an
oriental bazaar: It's not well organized, there are few content
guides, and it can take a lot of time and technical expertise to tap
its full potential.

<p class=para>
That's because...
<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-1.1">In the Beginning</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.INTERNET.HISTORY"></A><a name="CH01.HISTORY"></A>The Internet began in the late 1960s as an experiment in the design of
robust computer networks. The goal was to construct a network of
computers that could withstand the loss of several machines without
compromising the ability of the remaining ones to communicate. Funding
came from the U.S. Department of Defense, which had a vested
interest in building information networks that could withstand nuclear
attack.

<p class=para>
The resulting network was a marvelous technical success, but was
limited in size and scope. For the most part, only defense contractors
and academic institutions could gain access to what was then known as
the ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agency
network of the Department of Defense).

<p class=para>
With the advent of high-speed modems for digital communication over
common phone lines, some individuals and organizations not directly
tied to the main digital pipelines began connecting and taking
advantage of the network's advanced and global
communications. Nonetheless, it wasn't until these last few years
(around 1993, actually) that the Internet really took off.

<p class=para>
Several crucial events led to the meteoric rise in popularity of the
Internet. First, in the early 1990s, businesses and individuals eager
to take advantage of the ease and power of global digital
communications finally pressured the largest computer networks on the
mostly U.S. government-funded Internet to open their systems for nearly
unrestricted traffic. (Remember, the network wasn't designed to route
information based on content--meaning commercial messages went
through university computers that at the time forbade such activity.)

<p class=para>
True to their academic traditions of free exchange and sharing, many
of the original Internet members continued to make substantial
portions of their electronic collections of documents and software
available to the newcomers--free for the taking! Global
communications, a wealth of free software and information: who
could resist?

<p class=para>
Well, frankly, the Internet was a tough row to hoe back then. Getting
connected and using the various software tools, if they were even
available for their computers, presented an insurmountable technology
barrier for most people. And, too, most available information was
plain-vanilla ASCII about academic subjects, not
the neatly packaged fare that attracts users to the online services,
such as America Online, Prodigy, or CompuServe. The Internet was just
too disorganized and, outside of the government and academia, few
people had the knowledge or interest to learn how to use the arcane
software or had the time to spend rummaging through
documents looking for ones of interest.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-1.2">HTML and the World Wide Web</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH01.WWW.HISTORY"></A><a name="CH01.HISTORY.WWW"></A>It took another spark to light the Internet rocket. At about the same
time the Internet opened up for business, some physicists at
CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory,
released an authoring language and distribution system they developed
for creating and sharing multimedia-enabled, integrated electronic
documents over the Internet. And so was born <i class=emphasis>HyperText
Markup Language</I>
(<i class=emphasis>HTML</I>), browser software, and
the World Wide Web. No longer did authors have to distribute their
work as fragmented collections of pictures, sounds, and
text. HTML unified those elements. Moreover, the
World Wide Web's systems enabled <i class=emphasis>hypertext
linking</I> wherein documents automatically reference other
documents, located anywhere around the world: less rummaging, more
productive time online.

<p class=para>
Lift-off happened when some bright students and faculty at the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications
(NCSA) at the University of Illinois,
Urbana/Champaign, wrote a Web browser called
Mosaic. Although designed primarily for viewing
HTML documents, the software also had built-in
tools to access the much more prolific resources on the Internet, such
as FTP archives of software and Gopher-organized
collections of documents.

<p class=para>
With versions based on easy-to-use graphical-user interfaces familiar
to most computer owners, Mosaic became an instant success. It,
like most Internet software, was available on the Net for
free.[1] 
Millions of users snatched up a copy and began surfing the Internet
for ``cool Web pages.''

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
Not all browsers are free, nor are all browsers free to everyone. The
various client browser and server software are commercially
available, including documentation and support. Internet
``bundled'' software sold through mail order or retail often
contains a licensed copy of one of the popular browsers like Mosaic or
Netscape, possibly customized for the package. Moreover, the browsers
available for download over the Internet typically contain licensing
agreements which stipulate that the software is free only for use by
non-profit organizations.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-1.3">Golden Threads</A></h3>

<p class=para>
There you have the history of the Internet and the World Wide Web in a
nutshell: from rags to riches in just two short years. The Internet
has spawned an entirely new medium for worldwide information exchange
and commerce, and its pioneers are profiting well. For instance, when
the marketeers caught on to the fact that they could cheaply produce
and deliver eye-catching, wow-and-whizbang commercials and product
catalogs to those millions of Web surfers around the world, there was
no stopping the stampede of blue suede shoes. Even the key developers
of Mosaic and related Web server technologies sensed potential riches.
They left NCSA and formed Netscape Communications
to produce the Netscape Navigator browser and Web
server software that is useful for Internet
commercial activity.

<p class=para>
Business users and marketing opportunities have helped invigorate the
Internet and fuel its phenomenal growth, particularly on the World
Wide Web. According to a recent marketing survey by
<i class=emphasis>Activ</I>Media, Inc. (Peterborough, NH), over half of
Internet enterprises become profitable within a year of launch! But
do not forget that the Internet is first and foremost a place for
social interaction and information sharing, not a strip mall or direct
advertising medium. Internet users, particularly the old-timers, adhere
to commonly held, but not formally codified, rules of
<i class=emphasis>netiquette</I> that prohibit such things as
``spamming'' special-interest newsgroups with messages
unrelated to the topic at hand or sending unsolicited email. And there
are millions of users ready to remind you of those rules should you
inadvertently or intentionally ignore them.

<p class=para>
And, certainly, the power of HTML and network
distribution of information go well beyond marketeering and monetary
rewards: serious informational pursuits also benefit. Publications,
complete with images and other media like executable software, can get
to their intended audience in a blink of an eye, instead of the months
traditionally required for printing and mail delivery. Education takes
a great leap forward when students gain access to the great libraries
of the world. And at times of leisure, the interactive capabilities of
HTML links can reinvigorate our otherwise
television-numbed minds.
