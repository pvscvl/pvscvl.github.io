<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH03-SECT-4">3.4 Document Content</A></h2>

<p class=para>
Nearly everything else you put into your HTML
document that isn't a tag is, by definition, content, and the majority
of that, in most, not all, HTML documents, is
text. Like tags, document content is encoded using a specific
character set, the ISO-8859-1 Latin
character set, by default. This character set is a superset of
conventional ASCII, adding the necessary characters
to support the Western European languages. If your keyboard does not
allow you to directly enter the characters you need, you can use
character entities to insert the desired characters.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH03-SECT-4.1">Advice Versus Control</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Perhaps the hardest rule to remember when marking up an
HTML document is that all the tags you insert
regarding text display and formatting are only advice for the browser:
they do not explicitly control how the browser will display the
document. In fact, the browser can choose to ignore all of your tags
and do what it pleases with the document content. What's worse, the
user (of all people!) has control over text-display characteristics of
his or her own browser. Imagine that.
<p class=para>
 Get used to this lack of control. The best way to use
HTML markup to control the appearance of your
documents is to concentrate on the content of the document, not on its
final appearance. If you find yourself worrying excessively about
spacing, alignment, text breaks, and character positioning, you'll
surely end up with ulcers. You will have gone beyond the intent of
HTML. If you focus on delivering information to
users in an attractive manner, using the tags to advise the browser as
to how best to display that information, you are using
HTML effectively, and your documents will render
well on a wide range of browsers.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH03-SECT-4.2">Character Entities</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Besides common text, HTML gives you a way to
display special text characters you might not normally be able to
include in your source document or which have other purposes in
HTML. A good example is the less-than
(&lt;) symbol. In HTML, it normally
signifies the start of a tag, so if you insert it simply as part of
your text, the browser will get confused and probably misinterpret
your document.
<p class=para>
 
In HTML, the ampersand
(&amp;) character instructs the browser to insert a
special character, formally known as a <i class=emphasis>character
entity</I>. For example, the command ``&amp;lt;''
inserts that pesky less-than symbol into the rendered text. Similarly,
``&amp;gt;'' inserts the greater-than symbol, and
``&amp;amp;'' inserts an ampersand. There can be no spaces
between the ampersand, the entity name, and the required, trailing
semicolon. (Semicolons aren't special characters; you don't need to
use an ampersand sequence to normally display a semicolon.)
<p class=para>
You also may replace the entity name after the ampersand with a
decimal value between 0 and 255 corresponding to the entity's position
in the character set. Hence, the sequence ``&amp;#60;'' does
the same thing as ``&amp;lt;'' and represents the less-than
symbol. In fact, you could substitute all the normal characters within
an HTML document with ampersand-special characters,
such as ``&amp;#65;'' for a capital ``A'' or
``&amp;#97;'' for its lowercase version, but that would be
silly. A complete listing of all characters, their names, and
numerical equivalents can be found in <a href="appd_01.htm">Appendix D</A>.
<p class=para>
Keep in mind that not all special characters can be rendered by all
browsers. Some browsers just ignore many of the special characters;
with others, the characters aren't available in the character
sets on a specific platform. Be sure to test your documents on a range
of browsers before electing to use some of the more obscure character
entities.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH03-SECT-4.3">Comments</A></h3>

<p class=para>

Comments are another type of textual content that appear in the source
HTML document, but are not rendered by the user's
browser. Comments fall between the special
<tt class=literal>&lt;!--</tt> and
<tt class=literal>--&gt;</tt> markup elements. Browsers
ignore the text between the comment character sequences.
<p class=para>
Here's a sample comment:
<div class=screen>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;
&lt;!-- This is a 
multiple line comment
that ends on this line --&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
There must be a space after the initial
<tt class=literal>&lt;!--</tt> and preceding the final
<tt class=literal>--&gt;</tt>, but you can put nearly anything
inside the comment otherwise. The biggest exception to this rule is
that the HTML standard doesn't let you nest
comments.[2]
<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
Netscape does let you nest comments, but the practice is
tricky; you cannot always predict how other browsers will react
to nested comments.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
 
As we mentioned above, Internet Explorer also lets you
place comments within a special <tt>&lt;comment&gt;</TT>
tag. Everything between the <tt>&lt;comment&gt;</TT> and
<tt>&lt;/comment&gt;</TT> tag is ignored by Internet Explorer, but
all other browsers will display the comment to the user. Because of
this undesirable behavior, we do not recommend using the
<tt>&lt;comment&gt;</TT> tag for comments. Instead, always use the
<tt class=literal>&lt;!--</tt> and
<tt class=literal>--&gt;</tt> sequences to delimit comments.
<p class=para>
 Besides the obvious use of comments for
HTML source documentation, many World Wide Web
servers use comments to take advantage of features specific to the
document server software. These servers scan the document for specific
character sequences within conventional HTML
comments and then perform some action based upon the commands embedded
in the comments. The action might be as simple as including text from
another file (known as a <i class=emphasis>server-side include</I>) or
as complex as executing other commands on the server to dynamically
generate the document contents.
