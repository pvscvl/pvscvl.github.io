<p class=para>
We didn't spend hours studiously pouring over some reference book
before we wrote our first HTML document. You
probably shouldn't either. HTML is simple to read
and understand, and it's simple to write, too. So let's get started
without first learning a lot of arcane rules.

<p class=para>
To help you get that quick, satisfying start, we've included this
chapter as a brief summary of the many elements of
HTML. Of course, we've left out a lot of details
and some tricks you should know.  Read the upcoming chapters to
get the essentials for becoming fluent in
HTML.

<p class=para>
Even if you are familiar with HTML, we recommend
you work your way through this chapter before tackling the rest
of the book. It not only gives you a working grasp of basic
HTML and its jargon, you'll also be more
productive later, flush with the confidence that comes from creating
attractive documents in such a short time.

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="USING-HTML-CH02-SECT-1">2.1 Writing Tools</A></h2>

<p class=para>
Use any text editor to create HTML documents, as
long as it can save your work on disk in
ASCII text file format. That's because, even though
HTML documents include elaborate text layout and
pictures, they're all just plain old ASCII
documents themselves. A fancier WYSIWYG editor or
an HTML translator for your favorite word processor
are fine, too--although they may not support the many
nonstandard HTML features we discuss later in this
book. You'll probably end up touching up the HTML
source text they produce, as well.

<p class=para>
While not needed to compose HTML, you should have
at least one version of a popular World Wide Web browser installed on
your computer to view your work, preferably Netscape Navigator,
NCSA Mosaic, or Microsoft's Internet
Explorer. That's because the HTML source document
you compose on your text editor doesn't look anything like what gets
displayed by a browser, even though it's the same document. Make sure
what your readers actually see is what you intended by viewing the
HTML document yourself with a browser. Besides, the
popular ones are free over the Internet. If you can't retrieve a
browser copy yourself, get a friend to give you a copy.

<p class=para>
Also note that you don't need a connection to the Internet or the
World Wide Web to write and view your HTML
documents. You may compose and view your documents stored on a hard or
floppy disk that's attached to your computer. You can even navigate
among your local documents with HTML's hyperlinking
capabilities without ever being connected to the Internet, or any
other network for that matter. In fact, we recommend that you work
locally to develop and thoroughly test your HTML
documents before you share them with others.

<p class=para>
We strongly recommend, however, that you <i class=emphasis>do</I> get a
connection to the Internet and to the World Wide Web if you are
serious about composing your own HTML
documents. You may download and view others' interesting Web pages and
see how they accomplished some interesting feature--good or
bad. Learning by example is fun, too. (Reusing others' work, on the
other hand, is often questionable, if not downright illegal.) An
Internet connection is particularly essential if you include in your
work hyperlinks to other documents on the Internet.
