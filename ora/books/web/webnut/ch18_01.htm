</DIV>

<p class=para>
The first line in an HTTP server response indicates whether the client
request was successful or not, and why. 
The status is given with a three-digit 
<i class=emphasis>server response code</I> (also known as a 
<i class=emphasis>status code</I>) and a descriptive message.
 
 
 
 

<p class=para>
Status codes are usually generated by Web servers, but
they might also be generated by CGI scripts that bypass
the server's precooked headers and supply
their own. Status codes are grouped as follows:

<div class=informaltable>
<p>
<a name="WEB-CH-18-TAB-1"></A>

<table class=INFORMALTABLE>
<tr class=row>
<th align="left">Code Range</TH>

</TABLE>
<p>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
HTTP defines only a few specific codes in each range,
although servers may define their own as needed. 
If a client
receives a code that it does not recognize, it should understand
its basic meaning from its numerical range. While most Web browsers handle codes in the 100-, 200-, and 300- range silently, some error codes in the 400- and 500- range are commonly reported back to the user (e.g., "404 Not Found").

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="WEB-CH-18-SECT-0.1">Informational</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A response in the range of 100-199 is informational, indicating 
that the client's request was received and is being processed.

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>100 Continue</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The initial part of the request has been received and 
the client may continue with its request.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>101 Switching Protocols</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The server is complying with a client request to switch 
protocols to the one specified in the <tt class=literal>Upgrade</tt> header field.</DL>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="WEB-CH-18-SECT-0.2">Client Request Successful</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A response in the range of 200-299 means that the client's request
was successful.

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>200 OK</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The client's request was successful, and the server's response contains
the requested data.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>201 Created</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This status code is used whenever a new URI is created. With this
result code, the <tt class=literal>Location</tt> header (described in
<a href="ch19_01.htm">Chapter 19, <i>HTTP Headers</i></A>) is given by the server to specify where the new data was placed.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>202 Accepted</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The request was accepted but not immediately acted upon. More information
about the transaction may be given in the entity body of the server's
response. There is no guarantee that the server will actually honor
the request, even though it may seem like a legitimate request at the
time of acceptance.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>203 Non-Authoritative Information</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The information in the entity header is from a local or third-party
copy and not from the original server. 

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>204 No Content</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
A status code and header is given in the response, but there is no entity 
body in the reply. Browsers should not update their document view upon 
receiving this response. This is a useful code for an imagemap handler
to return when the user clicks on useless or blank areas of an image.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>205 Reset Content</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The browser should clear the form used for this transaction
for additional input. Appropriate for data-entry CGI applications.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>206 Partial Content</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The server is returning partial data of the size requested.
Used in response to a request specifying a <tt class=literal>Range</tt> header.
The server must specify the range included in the response with
the <tt class=literal>Content-Range</tt> header.</DL>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="WEB-CH-18-SECT-0.3">Redirection</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A response code in the 300-399 range indicates that the request was not
performed and the client needs to take further action for a successful
request.

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>300 Multiple Choices</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The requested URI refers to more than one resource.
For example, the URI could refer to a document that has been 
translated into many languages. The entity body returned by the server
could have a list of more specific data about how to choose the correct
resource.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>301 Moved Permanently</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The requested URI is no longer used by the server, and the operation
specified in the request was not performed. The new location for the
requested document is specified in the <tt class=literal>Location</tt> header.
All future requests for the document should use the new URI.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>302 Moved Temporarily</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The requested URI has moved, but only temporarily. The
<tt class=literal>Location</tt> header points to the new location. Immediately after receiving this 
status code, the client should use the new URI to resolve the request,
but the old URI should be used for all future requests.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>303 See Other</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The requested URI can be found at a different URI (specified in
the <tt class=literal>Location</tt> header) and should
be retrieved by a GET on that resource. 

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>304 Not Modified</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This is the response code to an <tt class=literal>If-Modified-Since</tt> header, where the
URI has not been modified since the specified date. The entity body
is not sent, and the client should use its own local copy.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>305 Use Proxy</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The requested URI must be accessed through the proxy in the
<tt class=literal>Location</tt> header. </DL>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="WEB-CH-18-SECT-0.4">Client Request Incomplete</A></h3>

<p class=para>
A response code in the range of 400-499 means that the client's request
was incomplete, and may indicate further information is required from
the client.

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>400 Bad Request</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This response code indicates that the server detected a syntax error
in the client's request.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>401 Unauthorized</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The result code is given along with the <tt class=literal>WW-Authenticate</tt> header
to indicate that the request lacked proper authorization, and
the client should supply proper authorization when requesting this
URI again.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>402 Payment Required</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This code is not yet implemented in HTTP.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>403 Forbidden</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The request was denied for a reason the server does not want to
(or has no means to) indicate to the client.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>404 Not Found</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The document at the specified URI does not exist.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>405 Method Not Allowed</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This code is given with the <tt class=literal>Allow</tt> header and indicates that the
method used by the client is not supported for this URI.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>406 Not Acceptable</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The URI specified by the client exists, but not in a format preferred
by the client. Along with this code, the server provides the
<tt class=literal>Content-Language</tt>, <tt class=literal>Content-Encoding</tt>, and <tt class=literal>Content-Type</tt> headers.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>407 Proxy Authentication Required</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The proxy server needs to authorize the request before forwarding it. Used with the <i class=emphasis>Proxy-Authenticate</I> header.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>408 Request Time-out</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This response code means the client did not produce a full 
request within some predetermined
time (usually specified in the server's configuration), and the server
is disconnecting the network connection.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>409 Conflict</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This code indicates that the request conflicts with another request
or with the server's configuration. Information about the conflict
should be returned in the data portion of the reply.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>410 Gone</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This code indicates that the requested URI no longer exists and has
been permanently removed from the server.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>411 Length Required</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The server will not accept the request without a <tt class=literal>Content-Length</tt>
header supplied in the request. 

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>412 Precondition Failed</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The condition specified by one or more <tt class=literal>If...</tt> headers
in the request evaluated to false. 

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>413 Request Entity Too Large</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The server will not process the request because its entity
body is too large. 

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>414 Request-URI Too Long</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The server will not process the request because its request
URI is too large.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>415 Unsupported Media Type</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The server will not process the request because its entity
body is in an unsupported format.</DL>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="WEB-CH-18-SECT-0.5">Server Errors</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Response codes in the range of 500-599 indicate that the server
encountered an error and may be unable to perform
the client's request.

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>500 Internal Server Error</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This code indicates that a part of the server (for example, a CGI program)
has crashed or encountered a configuration error.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>501 Not Implemented</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This code indicates that the client requested an action that
cannot be performed by the server.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>502 Bad Gateway</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This code indicates that the server (or proxy) encountered invalid
responses from another server (or proxy).

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>503 Service Unavailable</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This code means that the service is temporarily unavailable, but
should be restored in the future. If the server knows when it will
be available again, a <tt class=literal>Retry-After</tt> header may also be supplied.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>504 Gateway Time-out</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
This response is like <tt class=literal>408</tt> (<tt class=literal>Request Time-out</tt>) except that a gateway
or proxy has timed out.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><tt class=literal>505 HTTP Version not supported</tt><dd>

<p class=para>
The server will not support the HTTP protocol version used
in the request. </DL>
