<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="WEB-CH-26-SECT-7">26.7 Access Control</A></h2>

<p class=para>
Your options for controlling access to your web with WebSite are similar to the
access schemes used by other servers. You can restrict access
by user with a user/password system, by the requesting IP address or hostname
(class restrictions), or both. Three pages of Server Admin are
used for access control.

<p class=para>
The Users and Groups pages are where you create users and give them
passwords and create groups of users. WebSite also uses the
concept of "realms," which are large collections of groups
and users. When you want to control access to a URL path
on your web, you pick a realm first, and then groups and
users in that realm who are permitted access.

<p class=para>
The Users page of Server Admin (shown in 
is 
for managing users and their passwords; it has three sections:

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>Authentication Realm</I><dd>

<p class=para>
You can select an existing realm to use (such as Web Server), create
a new realm (by pressing the New button), or delete an existing
realm. Your web can have one or multiple realms. You may want
to have a separate realm for each virtual server you have. When
you create a realm, it has no users.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>User</I><dd>

<p class=para>
You can select an existing user in the realm, change a user's password
(by pressing the Password button), or delete a user. The default
Web Server realm has an Admin user.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>Group Membership</I><dd>

<p class=para>
You can view and change the group membership status for the
selected user. Every realm automatically has an Administrators
group and a Users group. All groups you have created within a realm on the
Groups page are available here for selection. Every user in a realm 
is a member of Users, and cannot be removed unless they are deleted
altogether.

<p class=para>
The Groups page of Server Admin (shown in 
is 
used for managing groups and groups membership. It has three sections:

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>Authentication Realm</I><dd>

<p class=para>
This area works exactly the same as it does on the Users page. Here
you select which realm will be affected by the changes you make
on the rest of the page. Note that on both the Users and Groups
pages, you can create or delete realms.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>Group</I><dd>

<p class=para>
You can select an existing group in a realm, add a new group, or
delete a group. Every realm automatically has an Administrators
and a Users group. All users in a realm are members of Users
and cannot be removed.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>Group Membership</I><dd>

<p class=para>
You can view and change the selected group's membership list.
All available users in the selected realm will appear in the
non-members box (if they aren't already members). To add a user to
the group, select her name and press the Add button. It is easier
to add users to groups on the Users page when you create them and
set their passwords. If the Group(s) you want to add them to are already
created, you can add them there and save a possible extra step.

<p class=para>
</DL>
<p class=para>
Once you have your users, groups, and realms set up, you
can assign access based on them on the Access Control page.
Access can also be assigned based on IP address or hostname of the
requesting browser. You also use this page to disable automatic
directory listings and determine how the server will control
access restrictions per URL.

<p class=para>
The Access Control page is shown in 
It has several
sections:

<p>
<dl class=variablelist>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>URL Path or Special Function</I><dd>

<p class=para>
You can select, add, or delete a URL path or special function.
The URL path cannot specify a file, so all files and subdirectories
under that directory have the restrictions applied to them.
You can protect any document or CGI directory. To add a new URL
path, press the New button. In the popup dialog, type in the
new URL path and select a realm to which it will be restricted.
Since restrictions are applied by path, many "control points"
may exist along a path. The deepest access control point determines
the access restrictions at a particular level. In other words, when
the server receives a request from a browser, it starts at the level 
of the request and works up levels until it finds a control point.
The server applies the restrictions at that point and stops; it
does not look at restrictions above that point.
The special functions are URLs that start with a tilde (~) character
and are handled in a special way by the server. Some special function
URLs only retrieve data, such a <i class=emphasis>~stats</I> or <i class=emphasis>~imagemap</I>.
Other special function URLs cause the server to perform an administrative
task, such as <i class=emphasis>~cycle-acc</I> or <i class=emphasis>~cycle-err</I> to cycle the
access and error logs. All of the special function URLs in WebSite
are on the Access Control list, although only those that cause the server
to do something are protected. You cannot delete special functions from
the access control list.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>Disable Directory Listings</I><dd>

<p class=para>
This checkbox disables automatic directory listings for the selected
URL. Users will be able to view or download documents in that URL
directory hierarchy only with the specific filename. You can also
add user authentication and class restrictions to a URL with disabled
directory listings (i.e., authorized users can receive a directory
listing).

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>Logical OR Users and Class</I><dd>

<p class=para>
This checkbox tells the server how to evaluate access control. When the
box is not checked, the server uses the default method, first
looking for class restrictions and then for user authentication
(if the class restrictions are met). If the box is checked,
the server evaluates both class restrictions and user authentication.
If either condition is met, the server returns the requested URL.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>Authorized Users &amp; Groups</I><dd>

<p class=para>
You can view or change the users and/or groups authorized for
the selected URL path or special function. The realm for this
URL is displayed above the list. If no users or groups are shown
in this box, then the URL has no user authentication
restrictions.

<p>
<dt class=varlistentry><i class=emphasis>Class Restrictions</I><dd>

<p class=para>
In this section of the Access Control page, you specify
which connections to the Web are allowed and which are denied.
First decide the logic the server should follow in testing
connections. Should it first deny and then allow, or first allow
and then deny? Which you should choose depends on the scope of restriction. To delete an entry, select the entry from
the appropriate box and press Delete. To add a new entry,
place the cursor in the appropriate box and press New. A popup
dialog will open where you type in the address.
Class restrictions accept three kinds of entries: <tt class=literal>all</tt>, a
full or partial IP address, or a full or partial domain name.
You can use metacharacters (<tt class=literal>*</tt> and <tt class=literal>?</tt>) to match all or part of either
IP addresses or domain names. If you use domain names, you must 
turn on DNS reverse lookup on the Logging page. The server then
looks up the name for the IP address of each requesting node.
It is recommended that you don't use domain names or DNS reverse
lookup because the extra DNS traffic and waiting time may adversely
affect server performance.</DL>
