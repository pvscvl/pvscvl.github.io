<p class=para>
We think that Perl is an easy language to learn and use, and we hope to
convince you that we're right.  One thing that's easy about Perl is that
you don't have to say much before you say what you want to say.  In many
programming languages, you have to declare the types, variables, and
subroutines you are going to use before you can write the first
statement of executable code.  And for complex problems demanding
complex data structures, this is a good idea.  But for many simple,
everyday problems, you would like a programming language in which you
can simply say:

<p class=para>
<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
print "Howdy, world!\n";
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
and expect the program to do just that.

<p class=para>
Perl is such a language.  In fact, the example is a complete program,[1]
and if you feed it to the Perl interpreter, it will print "<tt class=literal>Howdy,
world!</tt>" on your screen.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
Or script, or application, or executable, or doohickey.  Whatever.
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
And that's that.  You don't have to say much
<i class=emphasis>after</I> you say what you want to say, either.
Unlike many languages, Perl thinks that falling off the end of your
program is just a normal way to exit the program.  You certainly
<i class=emphasis>may</I> call the <a href="ch03_02.htm">exit</A>
function explicitly if you wish, just as you <i class=emphasis>may</I>
declare some of your variables and subroutines, or even
<i class=emphasis>force</I> yourself to declare all your variables and
subroutines.  But it's your choice.  With Perl you're free to do The
Right Thing, however you care to define it.

<p class=para>
There are many other reasons why Perl is easy to use, but it would be
pointless to list them all here, because that's what the rest of the
book is for.  The devil may be in the details, as they say, but Perl
tries to help you out down there in the hot place too.  At every level,
Perl is about helping you get from here to there with minimum fuss and
maximum enjoyment.  That's why so many Perl programmers go around with
a silly grin on their face.

<p class=para>
This chapter is an overview of Perl, so we're not trying to present Perl
to the rational side of your brain.  Nor are we trying to be complete, or
logical.  That's what the next chapter is for.[2]
This chapter presents Perl to the <i class=emphasis>other</I> side of your brain, whether
you prefer to call it associative, artistic, passionate, or merely
spongy.  To that end, we'll be presenting various views of Perl that
will hopefully give you as clear a picture of Perl as the blind men had
of the elephant.  Well, okay, maybe we can do better than that.
We're dealing with a camel here.  Hopefully, at least one of these
views of Perl will help get you over the hump.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[2] 
Vulcans (and like-minded humans) should skip this overview and go
straight to <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>The Gory Details</i></A>, for maximum information density.  If, on
the other hand, you're looking for a carefully paced tutorial, you
should probably get Randal's nice book, <i class=emphasis>Learning
Perl</I> (published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates).  But don't throw out this book just yet.
