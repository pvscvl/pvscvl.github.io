<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="PERL2-CH-8-SECT-5">8.5 Distribution and Installation</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH08.DIS1"></A><a name="CH08.DIS2"></A>You should see the Preface of this book for how to fetch and build a
Perl kit for your system.  Specific installation instructions come in
the <i class=emphasis>README</I> file of the Perl distribution kit.
Typically, you'll get the Perl kit either as a
<i class=emphasis>tar</I> file or as a set of <i class=emphasis>shar</I>
(shell archive) scripts.[4] A <i class=emphasis>.Z</I> extension
indicates you need to <i class=emphasis>uncompress</I> the file first.
A <i class=emphasis>.gz</I> extension indicates you need to
<i class=emphasis>gunzip</I> the file first.  You then unpack the file
as appropriate, read the <i class=emphasis>README</I> file and run a
massive shell script called <i class=emphasis>Configure</I>,
which tries to
figure out everything about your system.  After this is done, you do a
series of "makes" to find header file dependencies, to compile
Perl (and <i class=emphasis>a2p</I>), to run regression tests, and to
install Perl in your system directories.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[4] 
 Operating systems other than
UNIX may have special instructions, in which case you should follow
them instead of what's in this section.  Look for a file named
<i class=emphasis>README.xxx</I>, where <i class=emphasis>xxx</I> is
your OS name.  
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
It's possible you'll get a copy of Perl that is already compiled.
You'll have to make sure you get <i class=emphasis>suidperl</I>,
<i class=emphasis>a2p</I>, and <i class=emphasis>s2p</I> as well, and the
Perl library routines (see <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, <i>The Standard Perl Library</i></A>).  Install
these files in the directories that your version was compiled for.
Note: binary distributions of Perl are made available because they're
handy, not because you are restricted from getting the source and
compiling it yourself.  The people who give you the binary
distribution ought to provide you with some form of access to the
source, if only a pointer to where <i class=emphasis>they</I> got the
source from.  See the <i class=emphasis>Copying</I> file in the
distribution for more information.  

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="PERL2-CH-8-SECT-5.1">Translation from Awk and Sed</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Along with the Perl distribution come three translators:
<i class=emphasis>a2p</I>, which translates <i class=emphasis>awk</I> (1)
(not necessarily <i class=emphasis>nawk</I> (1)) scripts to Perl;
<i class=emphasis>s2p</I>, which translates <i class=emphasis>sed</I> (1)
scripts to Perl; and <i class=emphasis>find2perl</I>, which translates
<i class=emphasis>find</I> (1) commands to Perl.
These translators don't necessarily produce idiomatic Perl, but you
can use the output as a starting place.  The translators can also help
you see how the features of other languages map into those of Perl.

<p class=para>
The <i class=emphasis>a2p</I> translator is written in C, so it is
compiled and installed automatically along with Perl.  The
<i class=emphasis>s2p</I> and <i class=emphasis>find2perl</I>
translators are themselves written in Perl, so no further compilation
is necessary.  They are installed automatically when Perl is
installed.  They are described more fully in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, <i>Social Engineering</i></A>.

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="PERL2-CH-8-SECT-5.2">Examples</A></h3>

<p class=para>
The Perl source distribution comes with some sample scripts in the
<i class=emphasis>eg/</I> subdirectory.  Feel free to browse among them and use them.  They
are not installed automatically, however, so you'll need to copy them to
the appropriate directory, and possibly fix the <tt class=literal>#!</tt> line to point to
the right interpreter.

<p class=para>
The files in the <i class=emphasis>t/</I> and <i class=emphasis>lib/</I> subdirectories, although incredibly
arcane in spots, can also serve as examples.

<p class=para>
The examples in this book are also available for anonymous FTP from
<i class=emphasis>ftp.ora.com</I> and the <i class=emphasis>scripts</I> 
subdirectory of CPAN.  (See the Preface for more information about CPAN.)

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="PERL2-CH-8-SECT-5.3">Patches</A></h3>

<p class=para>
Since Perl is constantly being honed and improved, Larry occasionally posts
patches through CPAN.  Your distribution is likely to have had most of
the patches applied already--check the output of <i class=emphasis>perl -v</I> to see
the current patchlevel of your distribution.

<p class=para>
Bug reports may be reported by invoking the <i class=emphasis>perlbug</I> command,
included with the Perl distribution.

<p class=para>
Patches are sent out with complete instructions on how to apply them.
You'll want to have the <i class=emphasis>patch</I>
program handy. 
(This program was written in self-defense by Larry when he
couldn't persuade people to apply (in order and by hand) all his <i class=emphasis>rn</I>
patches, resulting in cascading chaotic catastrophes around the world.)  The
<i class=emphasis>patch</I> program is available from the GNU project, because they have
taken over the maintenance (the patching of <i class=emphasis>patch</I>, how quaint) after
Larry got a little more busy with Perl.
