<p class=para>
<a name="CH07.PROTO1"></A><a name="CH07.PROTO2"></A><a name="CH07.PROTO3"></A><a name="CH07.PROTO4"></A>      We've seen that a constructor function defines a "class" of
      objects in JavaScript--all objects created with a given
      constructor will be initialized in the same way and will therefore
      have the same set of properties. These properties may include
      methods, for (as we've also seen) you can use a constructor
      function to assign a set of methods to each object that is a
      member of the class.
    

<p class=para>
      In Navigator 3.0 and Internet Explorer 3.0, there is another way
      to specify the 
      methods, constants, and other properties that all objects in a
      class will support. The technique is to define the methods and
      other properties in a <i class=emphasis>prototype object</I> for
      the class. A prototype object is a special object, associated
      with the constructor function for a class, that has a very
      important feature: any properties defined by the prototype object
      of a class will appear as properties of every object of that
      class. This is true of properties that are added to the prototype
      both before and after the objects are defined. The properties of
      the prototype object of a class are shared by all objects of that
      class (i.e., objects do not get their own unique copy of the
      prototype properties, so memory usage is minimal).
    

<p class=para>
      The properties of the prototype object for a class can be read
      through all objects of the class, and, although they appear to be,
      they are not actually properties of those objects. There is a
      single copy of each prototype property, and this copy is shared by
      all objects in the class. When you read one of these properties
      of an object, you are reading that shared value from the prototype
      object. When you set the value of one of these properties for a
      particular object, on the other hand, you are actually creating a
      new property for that one object. From that point on, for that one
      particular object, the newly created property "shadows," or hides,
      the shared property in the prototype object.
      <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-OBJECTS-FIG-1">Figure 7-1</A> illustrates how a
      private, non-shared property can shadow a shared prototype
      property.

</DIV>

<p class=para>
      Because prototype properties are shared by all objects of a class,
      it only generally makes sense to use them to define properties
      that will be the same for all objects within the class. This
      makes them ideal for defining methods. Other properties with
      constant values (such as mathematical constants) are also suitable
      for definition with prototype properties. If your class defines a
      property with a very commonly used default value, you might define
      this property, and the default value in a prototype object. Then
      the few objects that want to deviate from the default value can
      create their own private, unshared, copy of the property,
      defining their own nondefault property value.
    

<p class=para>
      After all this discussion of how prototype objects and their
      properties work, we can now discuss where you can find prototype
      properties, and how they are created. The prototype object
      defines methods and other constant properties for a class of
      objects; classes of objects are defined by a common constructor;
      therefore, the prototype object should be associated with the
      constructor function. This is indeed the case. If we were to
      define a <tt class=literal>Circle()</tt> constructor function to
      create objects that represent circles, then the prototype object
      for this class would be <tt class=literal>Circle.prototype</tt>, and
      we could define a constant that would be available to all Circle
      objects like this:
      

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
Circle.prototype.pi = 3.14159;
</PRE>
</DIV>


    

<p class=para>
      The prototype object of a constructor is created automatically by
      JavaScript. In Navigator, it is created the first time the
      constructor is used 
      with the <tt class=literal>new</tt> operator. What this means is that
      you must create at least one object of a class before you can use
      the prototype object to assign methods and constants to objects of
      that class. So, if we have defined a <tt class=literal>Circle()</tt>
      constructor, but not yet used it to create any Circle objects,
      we'd define the constant property <tt class=literal>pi</tt> like this:
      

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> First create and discard a dummy Circle object.</i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> All this does is force the prototype object to be created.</i></tt>
new Circle();
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Now we can set properties in the prototype</i></tt>
Circle.prototype.pi = 3.14159;
</PRE>
</DIV>


      This requirement that an object be created before the prototype
      object is available is an unfortunate blemish in the JavaScript
      language design. If you forget to create an object before using
      the prototype you'll get an error message indicating that the
      prototype object does not have the property you are trying to set
      (i.e., the object does not exist). It is an annoyance, but a minor
      one. In Internet Explorer, it is not necessary to create a dummy
      object to force the prototype object to be created; IE provides a
      prototype object for all JavaScript functions, whether they are
      used as constructors or not.
    

<p class=para>
      Prototype objects and their properties can be quite confusing.
      <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-OBJECTS-FIG-1">Figure 7-1</A> illustrates several of
      the important prototype concepts; you should study it carefully.
      In addition to the figure, <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-OBJECTS-EX-4">Example 7-4</A> is a concrete example of how
      you can use prototypes to help you define a class of objects. In
      this example, we've switched from our Rectangle class to a new
      Circle class. The code defines a <tt class=literal>Circle</tt> class
      of objects, by first defining a
      <tt class=literal>Circle()</tt> constructor method to
      initialize each individual object, and then by setting properties
      on <tt class=literal>Circle.prototype</tt> to define methods,
      constants, and defaults shared by all instances of the class.
    

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JSCRIPT-CH-OBJECTS-EX-4">Example 7-4: Defining a Class with a Prototype Object</A></h4>

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Define a constructor method for our class.</i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Use it to initialize properties that will be different for</i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> each individual circle object.</i></tt>
function Circle(x, y, r) 
{
    this.x = x;  //<tt class=replaceable><i> the X coordinate of the center of the  circle</i></tt>
    this.y = y;  //<tt class=replaceable><i> the Y coordinate of the center of the circle</i></tt>
    this.r = r;  //<tt class=replaceable><i> the radius of the circle</i></tt>
}
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Create and discard an initial Circle object.</i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Doing this forces the prototype object to be created</i></tt>
new Circle(0,0,0);
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Now define a constant; a property that will be shared by</i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> all circle objects. Actually, we could just use Math.PI,</i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> but we do it this way for the sake of example.</i></tt>
Circle.prototype.pi = 3.14159;
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Now define some functions that perform computations on circles</i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Note the use of the constant defined above</i></tt>
function Circle_circumference() { return 2 * this.pi * this.r; }
function Circle_area() { return this.pi * this.r * this.r; }
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Make these functions into methods of all Circle objects by</i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> setting them as properties of the prototype object.</i></tt>
Circle.prototype.circumference = Circle_circumference;
Circle.prototype.area = Circle_area;
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Now define a default property. Most Circle objects will share this </i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> default value, but some may override it by setting creating their </i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> own unshared copy of the property.</i></tt>
Circle.prototype.url = "images/default_circle.gif";
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Now, create a circle object, and use the methods defined</i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> by the prototype object</i></tt>
c = new Circle(0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
a = c.area();
p = c.circumference();
</PRE>

<p class=para>
      An important point to note about prototypes is that in Navigator
      3.0, you can use them with built-in object types, not just those
      that you define yourself. For example, if you wrote a function
      that operated on a string object, you could assign it as a
      method to <tt class=literal>String.prototype</tt>, and make it
      accessible as a method of all JavaScript strings. This technique
      does not work in Internet Explorer 3.0. IE 3.0 does not support
      the prototypes for Boolean and Number objects, and the
      properties of <tt class=literal>String.prototype</tt> are only
      available to actual String objects, not primitive string values,
      as they are in Navigator. These shortcomings will be fixed in a
      future version of IE.
    

<p class=para>
      Finally, a couple of points to remember about prototypes are that
      they are not available in Navigator 2.0, and that prototype
      properties are shared by all objects of a given class, regardless
      of whether the prototype property is defined before or after any
      given object is created.
