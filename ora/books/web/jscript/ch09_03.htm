<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="ch09-SECT1-AUTOID.3">9.3 By Value vs. By Reference</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH09.VALREF1"></A><a name="CH09.VALREF2"></A><a name="CH09.VALREF3"></A><a name="CH09.VALREF4"></A><a name="CH09.VALREF5"></A><a name="CH09.ASSIGN"></A>      In JavaScript, and all programming languages, there are three
      important ways that you can manipulate a data value. First, you
      can copy it, by assigning it to a new variable, for example.
      Second, you can pass it as an argument to a function or method.
      Third, you can compare it with another value to see if the two
      values are equal. In order to understand any programming
      language, you must understand how these three operations are
      performed in that language. 
    

<p class=para>
      There are two fundamentally distinct techniques in which data
      values can be manipulated. These techniques are called "by value"
      and "by reference." When a value is manipulated "by value" it is
      the <i class=emphasis>value</I> of the datum that matters: in an
      assignment, a copy of the actual value is made and that copy is
      stored in a variable or object property or array element; the copy
      and the original are two totally independent values that are
      stored separately. When a datum is passed "by value" to a
      function, a <i class=emphasis>copy</I> of the datum is passed to
      the function; if the function modifies that value, the change
      affects only the function's copy of the datum--it does not
      affect the original datum. And when a datum is compared "by
      value" to another datum, the two distinct pieces of data must
      represent exactly the same value (which usually means that a
      byte-by-byte comparison finds them to be equal).
    

<p class=para>
      The other way of manipulating a datum is "by reference." With
      this technique, there is only one actual copy of the datum, and it
      is references to that datum that are manipulated.[1]
      When a datum is manipulated "by reference," there is only ever one
      copy of the actual value. If a value is manipulated "by
      reference," then variables do not hold that value directly; they
      only hold references to it. It is these references that are
      copied, passed, and compared.
    

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
	  C programmers, and anyone else familiar with the concept of
	  "pointers," will understand the idea of a "reference" in this
	  context. Note, however, that JavaScript does not support
	  pointers. 
	
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
      So, in an assignment made "by reference," it is the reference to
      the value that is assigned, not a copy of the value, and not the
      value itself. After the assignment, the new variable will contain
      the same reference to the value that the original variable
      contains. Both references are equally valid, and both can be used
      to manipulate the value--if the value is changed through one
      reference, that change will also appear through the original
      reference. The situation is similar when a datum is passed to a
      function "by reference:" a reference to the value is passed to the
      function, and the function can use that reference to modify the
      value itself; any such modifications will be visible outside the
      function. And finally, when a datum is compared to another "by
      reference," the two references are compared to see if they refer
      to the same unique copy of a value; references to two distinct
      datums that happen to have the same value (consist of the same
      bytes) will not be treated as equal.
    

<p class=para>
      These are two very different ways of manipulating values,
      and they have very important implications that you should
      understand.
      <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-FURTHER-TAB-2">Table 9.2</A>
      summarizes these implications. This discussion of manipulating
      data "by value" and "by reference" has been a general one: the
      distinctions apply to all programming languages. The subsections
      that follow explain how they apply specifically to
      JavaScript--which data types are manipulated by value and which
      are manipulated by reference.

<p class=para>
<a name="CH09.PRIM1"></A><a name="CH09.PRIM2"></A>	The basic rule in JavaScript is this: primitive types are
	manipulated by value, and reference types, as the name suggests,
	are manipulated by reference. Numbers and Booleans are
	primitive types in JavaScript--primitive because the consist of
	nothing more than a small fixed number of bytes, bytes that are
	very easily manipulated at the low (primitive) levels of the
	JavaScript interpreter. On the other hand, objects and arrays
	are reference types. These data types can contain arbitrary
	numbers of properties or elements, and so can be of arbitrary
	size, and cannot be so easily manipulated. Since object and
	array values can become quite large, it doesn't make sense to
	manipulate these types by value, which could involve the
	inefficient copying and comparing of large amounts of memory.
      

<p class=para>
	What about strings and functions?  These types may have
	arbitrary length, and so it would seem that they would be
	reference types. In fact, though, they are usually considered
	to be primitive types in JavaScript, simply for the reason that
	they are not objects or arrays. Strings and functions do not
	follow the "primitive types by value and reference types by
	reference" rule presented above, and will be discussed in a
	section of their own later in this chapter.
      

<p class=para>
	Examples using primitive and reference types are the best way to
	explore the differences between data manipulation by value and
	data manipulation by reference. Study the following examples
	carefully, paying attention to the comments. First, <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-FURTHER-EX-BY-VALUE">Example 9-1</A> copies, passes, and compares
	numbers. Since numbers are primitive types, this illustrates
	data manipulation by value.
      

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JSCRIPT-CH-FURTHER-EX-BY-VALUE">Example 9-1: Copying, Passing, and Comparing by Value</A></h4>

	Next, consider <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-FURTHER-EX-BY-REFERENCE">Example 9-2</A>. This example
	copies, passes, and compares an object. Since objects are
	reference types, these manipulations are performed "by
	reference." The example uses Date objects, which you can read
	about in the reference section of this book, if necessary.

</DIV>

<p class=para>
	Before we leave the topic of manipulating objects and arrays by
	reference, there is a point about passing values by reference
	that it is important to get straight. When an object is passed
	to a function, it is a reference to the object that is passed,
	not a copy of the object's actual value. As we've seen in <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-FURTHER-EX-BY-REFERENCE">Example 9-2</A> this means that we can
	modify the object's value through the reference, and these
	modifications will be visible when the function returns. What
	we cannot do, and this is where confusion can arise, is modify
	the reference itself. The function is passed a copy of the
	reference to the object (in a sense, the reference itself is
	"passed by value"). If the function changes its copy of the
	reference, that change does not affect the object value nor the
	original reference to the object, and the change will not be
	visible outside of the function. <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-FURTHER-EX-BY-REFERENCE2">Example 9-3</A> illustrates this.
      

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JSCRIPT-CH-FURTHER-EX-BY-REFERENCE2">Example 9-3: References Themselves Are Passed by Value</A></h4>

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> This is another version of the add_to_totals() function. It doesn't</i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> work, through, because instead of changing the array itself, it tries to </i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> change the reference to the array.</i></tt>
function add_to_totals2(totals, x)
{
    newtotals = new Array(3);
    newtotals[0] = totals[0] + x;
    newtotals[1] = totals[1] + x;
    newtotals[2] = totals[2] + x;
    totals = newtotals;  //<tt class=replaceable><i> this line has no effect outside of the function.</i></tt>
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
	Note that this rule applies not only to pass-by-reference, but
	also copy-by-reference. You can modify an object through a copy
	of a reference, but changing the copied reference itself does
	not affect the object nor the original reference to the object.
	This is a more intuitive and less confusing case, so we don't
	illustrate it with an example.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch09-SECT2-AUTOID.12">Copying and Passing Strings and Functions</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	As mentioned in the previous section, strings and functions in
	JavaScript don't fit neatly into the primitive-type versus
	reference-type dichotomy. For most purposes, strings and
	functions are considered primitive types by
	default--because they are not objects or arrays. If they are
	primitive types, then by the rules given above, they should be
	manipulated by value. But since a string can be arbitrarily
	long, and a function can contain an arbitrary amount of
	JavaScript code, these types do not have a fixed size, and it
	would be inefficient to copy, pass, and compare these data types
	byte by byte.
      

<p class=para>
	Since it is unclear whether JavaScript copies and passes
	strings and functions by value or by reference, we can try to
	write some JavaScript code to experiment with these data types.
	If they are copied and passed by reference, then we should be
	able to modify the contents of a string or function value
	through a copy of the value or a through a function that takes
	the value as an argument. When we set out to write the code to
	perform this experiment and determine whether strings and
	functions are copied and passed by reference, we run into a
	major stumbling block: there is no way to modify the contents of
	a string or a function. We can modify the contents of an object
	or an array by setting object properties or array elements. But
	strings and functions are <i class=emphasis>immutable</I> in
	JavaScript--that is, there is no JavaScript syntax, or
	JavaScript functions, methods, or properties that allow you to
	change the characters in the string or the code in the function.
      

<p class=para>
	Since strings and functions are immutable, our original
	question is moot: there is no way to tell if strings and
	functions are passed by value or by reference. Because of
	efficiency considerations, we can assume that JavaScript is
	implemented so that strings and functions are passed by
	reference, but in actuality it doesn't matter, since it has no
	practical bearing on the code we write.

<p class=para>
	Despite the fact that we cannot determine whether strings and
	functions are copied and passed by value or by reference, we can
	write JavaScript code to determine whether they are compared by
	value or by reference. <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-FURTHER-EX-COMPARE">Example 9-4</A>
	shows the code we might use to make this determination.

</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
	The results of this experiment are surprising. Strings are
	compared by value, and functions are compared by reference. The
	fact that strings are compared by value may be counter-intuitive
	to C, C++, and Java programmers--in those languages, strings are
	reference types, and you must use a special function or method
	when you want to compare them by value. JavaScript, however, is
	a higher-level language, and recognizes that when you compare
	strings you almost always want to compare them by value. Thus,
	as a special case, it compares strings by value even though they
	are (presumably) copied and passed by reference.
      

<p class=para>
	The fact that functions are compared by reference is quite
	reasonable. Since it doesn't make sense to write two separate
	functions that do exactly the same thing, we never really want
	to compare functions by value. Comparing functions by reference
	is far more useful.

<p class=para>
	We've seen above that objects are copied by reference. There is
	one exception to this rule, however. If the left-hand side of an
	assignment expression refers to an object, and that object has
	an <tt class=literal>assign()</tt> method, then instead of
	copying a reference to the right-hand value into the left-hand

	as its argument. You can define this method so that an
