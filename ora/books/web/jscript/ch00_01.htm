<p class=para>
    In recent months, the pace of technical innovation has shot through
    the roof. It's been said that the Internet has turned "man-months"
    into "web-weeks."  It's hard to keep up!
  

<p class=para>
    When Netscape released a final version of Navigator 2.0, I
    imagined that JavaScript would finally be stable, and that the
    time was ripe for a book documenting it. Soon after I started
    writing, a beta release of Netscape 3.0 was announced. It seems
    like I've been playing catch-up ever since. In order to keep up
    with this rapidly evolving language, we printed a "beta edition"
    of this book which documented the final beta release of Navigator
    3.0.
  

<p class=para>
    With the beta edition released, I was able to catch my breath and
    really document JavaScript the way it needed to be documented. This
    edition is far superior to the last. It is over one hundred pages
    longer and contains several new chapters, many practical new
    examples, far fewer errors, and dramatically improved coverage of
    cookies, the Image object, LiveConnect, and other topics.
  

<p class=para>
    Fortunately (for my sanity), this edition of the book goes to print
    <i class=emphasis>before</I> the first beta version of Navigator 4.0,
    a.k.a. Communicator, is released. The word is that there will be a
    lot of powerful and interesting new JavaScript features in Navigator
    4.0, and you can be sure that we'll update this book to cover them
    when the final version of 4.0 comes out. In the meantime, I hope
    you'll agree that this book is truly <i class=emphasis>the</I>
    definitive guide to JavaScript.

<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="ch00-SECT1-AUTOID.1">Conventions Used in This Book</A></h2>

<p class=para>
      I use the following formatting conventions in this book:
      

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>	    <b>Bold</b> is used for headings in
	    the text, and occasionally to refer to particular keys on
	    a computer keyboard or to portions of user interfaces, such
	    as the <b>Back</b> button or the
	    <b>Options</b> menu.
	  

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    <i class=emphasis>Italics</I> are used for emphasis, and to
	    signify the first use of a term. Italics are also used for
	    email addresses, web sites, FTP sites, file and directory
	    names, and newsgroups. Furthermore, italics are
	    in this book for the names of Java classes,
	    to help keep Java class names distinct from JavaScript
	    names. 
	  

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    <tt class=literal>Letter Gothic</tt> is used in all JavaScript
	    code and HTML text listings, and generally for anything that
	    you would type literally when programming.
	  

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    <tt class=replaceable><i>Letter Gothic Oblique</i></tt> is used for
	    the name of function arguments, and generally as a
	    placeholder to indicate an item that would be replaced with
	    some actual value in your programs.
	  

<p>
</UL>
