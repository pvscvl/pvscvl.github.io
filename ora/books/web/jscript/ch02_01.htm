    The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of elementary
    rules that specify how you write programs in the language. It is the
    lowest-level syntax of a language, and specifies such things as what
    variable names look like, what characters are used for comments, and how
    one program statement is separated from the next. This short chapter
    explains the lexical structure of JavaScript: it covers the above topics
    and others.
  

<div class=sect1>
<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="ch02-SECT1-AUTOID.1">2.1 Case Sensitivity</A></h2>

<p class=para>
      JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that language
      keywords, variables, function names, and any other identifiers
      must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of
      letters. The <tt class=literal>while</tt> keyword, for example, must
      be typed "while", and not "While" or "WHILE". Similarly,
      <tt class=literal>online</tt>, <tt class=literal>Online</tt>,
      <tt class=literal>OnLine</tt>, and <tt class=literal>ONLINE</tt> are four
      distinct variable names.
    

<p class=para>
      Note that HTML is not case-sensitive, which, because of its close
      association with JavaScript, can be confusing. In particular,
      names of event handlers[1] are often typed in mixed-case in HTML
      (<tt class=literal>onClick</tt> or <tt class=literal>OnClick</tt>, for
      example) but must be all lowercase when referenced from JavaScript
      (<tt class=literal>onclick</tt>).

<p class=para>[1] 
	  Event handlers are pieces of JavaScript code used as the value
	  of HTML attributes.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch02-SECT2-AUTOID.1">Case Sensitivity in Internet Explorer</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	In Internet Explorer 3.0, the core JavaScript language is
        case-sensitive, as it is in Navigator. Unfortunately, all of the
	objects, and their methods and properties, added to this core
	language by client-side JavaScript are case-insensitive in IE.
	The Date and Math objects are a built-in part of core
	JavaScript, so they are case-sensitive in IE; to compute a sine,
	you must invoke <tt class=literal>Math.sin()</tt>, exactly as shown
	here. On the other hand, the Document object is part of
	client-side JavaScript, so it is not case-sensitive. This means
	that where you would type <tt class=literal>document.write()</tt> in
	Navigator, you could use <tt class=literal>Document.Write()</tt>,
	<tt class=literal>DOCUMENT.WRITE()</tt>, or even
	<tt class=literal>DoCuMeNt.WrItE()</tt> in Internet Explorer.
      

<p class=para>
	All user-defined variables, functions, and objects are
        case-sensitive in IE; it is just the client-side objects and their
	predefined methods and properties that are not. This does
	mean, however that you need to be careful how you name your
	variables and properties. For example, the Window object has a
	property named <tt class=literal>parent</tt>. In Navigator, it
	would be perfectly safe to create a new property of a Window
	object and name it <tt class=literal>Parent</tt>. This would not be
	okay in IE, however, and would either cause an error or
	overwrite the value of the <tt class=literal>parent</tt> property.
      

<p class=para>
	The reason that client-side objects are not case-sensitive in IE
	is that IE allows the same client-side objects to be used by the
	VBScript scripting language. VBScript, like Visual Basic, is not
	case-sensitive, so Microsoft felt that their client-side objects
	must not be either. Because of Microsoft's requirement for
	VBScript, it is not likely that the client-side objects will
	become case-sensitive in a future version of IE; this is an
	incompatibility that we will have to live with.
      

<p class=para>
	This incompatibility presents a worst-of-both-worlds situation.
	Because Navigator is case-sensitive, you must be sure to type
	all your object, method, and property names in exactly the
	correct case. But because IE is not case-sensitive, you can't
	take advantage of Navigator's case sensitivity to create
	different variables with the same spelling and different
	capitalizations.
