<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT1-AUTOID.3">1.3 What JavaScript Can Do</A></h2>

<p class=para>
      JavaScript is a relatively general-purpose programming language,
      and, as such, you can write programs in it to perform arbitrary
      computations. You can write simple scripts, for example, that
      compute Fibonacci numbers, or search for primes. In the context of
      the Web and web browsers, however, these aren't particularly
      interesting applications of the language. As mentioned earlier,
      the real power of JavaScript lies in the browser and
      document-based objects that the language supports. To give you an
      idea of JavaScript's potential, the following subsections list
      and explain the important capabilities of JavaScript and of the
      objects it supports.
    

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.3">Control Document Appearance and Content</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	
	The JavaScript Document object, through its
	<tt class=literal>write()</tt> method that we have already seen,
	allows you to write arbitrary HTML into a document as the
	document is being parsed by the browser. For example, this
	allows you to always include today's date in a document, or
	to display different text on different platforms, or even
	perhaps extra text to appear only on those browsers that support
	JavaScript.
      

<p class=para>
	You can also use the Document object to generate documents
	entirely from scratch. Furthermore, properties of the Document
	object allow you to specify colors for the document background,
	the text, and for the hypertext links within it. What this
	amounts to is the ability to generate dynamic and conditional
	HTML documents, a technique that works particularly well in
	multiframe documents. Indeed, in some cases, dynamic
	generation of frame contents allows a JavaScript program to
	entirely replace the use of a traditional CGI script.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.4">Control the Browser</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	
	Several JavaScript objects allow control over the behavior of
	the browser. The Window object supports methods to pop up dialog
	boxes to display simple messages to the user and to get simple
	input from the user. This object also defines a method to create
	and open (and close) entirely new browser windows, which can
	have any specified size and can have any combination of user
	controls. This allows you, for example, to open up multiple
	windows to give the user multiple views of your web site. New
	browser windows are also useful for temporary display of
	generated HTML, and, when created without the menu bar and other
	user controls, can serve as dialog boxes for more complex
	messages or user input.
      

<p class=para>
	JavaScript does not define methods that allow you to directly
	create and manipulate frames within a browser window. However,
	the ability to dynamically generate HTML allows you to
	programmatically write the HTML tags that will create any
	desired frame layout.
      

<p class=para>
	JavaScript also allows control over which web pages are
	displayed in the browser. The Location object allows you to
	download and display the contents of any URL in any window or
	frame of the browser. The History object allows you to move
	forward and back within the user's browsing history, simulating
	the action of the browser's <b>Forward</b> and <b>Back</b> buttons.
      

<p class=para>
	Finally, yet another method of the Window object allows
	JavaScript to display arbitrary messages to the user in the
	status line of any browser window.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.5">Interact with Document Content</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	
	The JavaScript Document object, and the objects it contains,
	allow programs to read, and sometimes interact with, portions of
	the document. It is not possible to read the actual text itself
	(although this will probably be possible in a future release of
	JavaScript) but, for example, it is possible to obtain a list of
	all hypertext links in a document.[4]
	In Navigator 3.0, it is even possible to use JavaScript to
	obtain an array of all images and Java applets embedded in a
	document.
      

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[4] 
	    For important security reasons in Navigator 2.0 and 3.0,
	    this is only true when the script reading the list of links
	    (or other information) was loaded from the same web server
	    as the page containing the links. Because of this security
	    restriction, you currently cannot download an arbitrary page
	    off the Web, and have JavaScript return you an array of the
	    hypertext links on that page--i.e., you cannot write a
	    web crawler in JavaScript. See <a href="ch20_01.htm">Chapter 20, <i>JavaScript Security</i></A>, for a full discussion of
	    this restriction and its resolution in a future version of
	    JavaScript. 
	  
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
	
	By far the most important capability for interacting with
	document contents is provided by the Form object, and by the
	Form element objects it can contain: the Button, Checkbox,
	Hidden, Password, Radio, Reset, Select, Submit, Text and
	Textarea elements. These element objects allow you to read and
	write the values of any input element in any form in the
	document. For example, the Internal Revenue Service could
	create a web page that contains a U.S. 1040EZ income tax
	return. When the user enters his filing status and gross
	income, JavaScript code could read the input, compute the
	appropriate personal exemption and standard deduction,
	subtract these values from the income, and fill in the result
	in the appropriate data field of the form. This technique is
	frequently seen in JavaScript calculator programs, which are
	common on the Web, and in fact, we'll see a tax calculator
	example, much like the one described above, a little later on
	in this chapter.
      

<p class=para>
	While HTML forms have traditionally be used only with CGI
	scripts, JavaScript is much more practical in some
	circumstances. Calculator programs like those described above
	are easy to implement with JavaScript, but would be impractical
	with CGI, because the server would have to be contacted to
	perform a computation every time the user entered a value or
	clicked on a button.
      

<p class=para>
	
	Another common use for the ability to read user input from form
	elements is for verification of a form before it is
	submitted. If client-side JavaScript is able to perform all
	necessary error checking of a user's input, then the required
	CGI script on the server side becomes much simpler, and no round
	trip to the server is necessary to detect and inform the user of
	the errors. Client-side JavaScript can also perform
	preprocessing of input data, which can reduce the amount of data
	that must be transmitted to the server. In some cases,
	client-side JavaScript can eliminate the need for CGI scripts on
	the server altogether! (On the other hand, JavaScript and CGI do
	work well together. For example, a CGI program can dynamically
	create JavaScript code "on the fly," just as it dynamically creates
	HTML.)

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.6">Interact with the User</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	
	An important feature of JavaScript is the ability to define
	"event handlers"--arbitrary pieces of code to be executed
	when a particular event occurs. Usually, these events are
	initiated by the user, when (for example) she moves the mouse
	over a hypertext link or enters a value in a form or clicks the
	<b>Submit</b> button in a form. This
	event-handling capability is a crucial one, because programming
	with graphical interfaces, such as HTML forms, inherently
	requires an event-driven model. JavaScript can trigger any kind
	of action in response to user events. Typical examples might be
	to display a special message in the status line when the user
	positions the mouse over a hypertext link, or to pop up a
	confirmation dialog box when the user submits an important form.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.7">Read and Write Client State with Cookies</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	
	"Cookies" are Netscape's term for small amounts of state data
	stored permanently or temporarily by the client. They are
	transmitted back and forth to and from the server and allow a
	web page or web site to "remember" things about the
	client--for example, that the user has previously visited
	the site, or that they have already registered and obtained a
	password, or that they've expressed preferences about colors or
	layouts of web pages. Cookies help you provide the state
	information that is missing from the stateless HTTP protocol of
	the Web. The "My Yahoo!" site at
	<i class=emphasis>http://my.yahoo.com/</I> is an excellent example
	of the use of cookies to remember a user's preferences.
      

<p class=para>
	When cookies were invented, they were intended for use
	exclusively by CGI scripts, and although stored on the client,
	they could only be read or written by the server. Their purpose
	was to allow CGI scripts to generate and send different HTML to
	the client depending on the value of the cookies. JavaScript
	changes this. JavaScript programs can read and write cookie
	values, and as we've noted above, they can dynamically generate
	HTML based on the value of cookies. The implications of this are
	subtle. CGI programming will still be an important technique in
	many cases that use cookies. In some cases, however, JavaScript
	can entirely replace the need for CGI.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.8">Interact with Applets</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	    
	In Navigator 3.0, JavaScript can interact with Java applets
	that are running in the browser. This important feature is part
	of Netscape's "LiveConnect", a communication layer that
	allows Java applets, Netscape plug-ins, and JavaScript code talk
	with and control one another. Using LiveConnect, JavaScript
	code can read and write properties of, and invoke methods of,
	Java applets and plug-ins. This capability is tremendously
	powerful, and truly allows JavaScript to "script" Java.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.9">Manipulate Embedded Images</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	    
	In Navigator 3.0, JavaScript can change the images displayed by
	an <tt class=literal>&lt;IMG&gt;</tt> tag. This allows
	sophisticated effects, such as having an image change when the
	mouse passes over it or when the user clicks on a button
	elsewhere in the browser. When Navigator 3.0 was released
	recently, this capability spawned a burst of creativity on web
	sites designed for the new browser.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.10">Still More Features</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	In addition to all of the above, there are quite a few other
	JavaScript capabilities:
      

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>	    
	    As mentioned at the start of this section, JavaScript can
	    perform arbitrary computation. JavaScript has a
	    floating-point data type, arithmetic operators that work
	    with it, and a full complement of the standard
	    floating-point mathematical functions. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    The JavaScript Date object simplifies the
	    process of computing and working with dates and times.
	  

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    
	    The Document object supports a property that specifies the "last
	    
	    modified" date for the current document. You can use it to
	    automatically display a timestamp on any document.
	  

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    
	    JavaScript has a <tt class=literal>window.setTimeout()</tt>
	    method that allows a block of arbitrary JavaScript code to
	    be executed some number of milliseconds in the
	    future. This is useful for building delays or repetitive
	    actions into a JavaScript program. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>    	    The Navigator object (named after the web browser, of
	    course) has variables that specify the name and version of
	    the browser that is running, and also has variables that
	    identify the platform it is running on. These variables
	    allow scripts to customize their behavior based on browser
	    or platform in order, for example, to take advantage of
	    extra capabilities supported by some versions or to work
	    around bugs that exist on some platforms.
	    

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    In Navigator 3.0, JavaScript uses the
	    <tt class=literal>navigator.plugins[]</tt> array to
	    specify which "plug-ins" are installed in the browser; JavaScript
	    uses the <tt class=literal>navigator.mimeTypes[]</tt>
	    array to specify which MIME data formats are recognized by
	    the browser. 

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    In Navigator 3.0, the <tt class=literal>scroll()</tt>
	    method of the Window object allows JavaScript programs to
	    scroll windows in the X and Y dimensions.
