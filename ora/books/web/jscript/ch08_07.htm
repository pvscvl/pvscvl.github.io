<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="ch08-SECT1-AUTOID.7">8.7 Arrays in Navigator 2.0</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH08.TWO"></A>      As noted above, the implementation of arrays in Navigator 2.0 is
      substantially different than that in either Navigator 3.0 or
      Internet Explorer 3.0. One of the differences we've seen is that
      there is no <tt class=literal>Array()</tt> constructor in
      Navigator 2.0, and so you may want to write your own constructor
      function. Similarly, you may want to manage the value of a
      <tt class=literal>length</tt> (or <tt class=literal>size</tt>) property
      yourself.
    

<p class=para>
      But the biggest difference between Navigator 2.0 and 3.0 is in how
      array elements and object properties interact. In both versions
      of Navigator, arrays and objects are the same basic data type:
      objects can have array elements, and arrays can have object
      properties. The difference is that in Navigator 2.0, elements and
      properties can <i class=emphasis>overwrite</I> each other; in
      Navigator 3.0 they can't.
    

<p class=para>
      In Navigator 2.0, a newly defined property takes up the "slot"
      of the next available array element. Thus after executing the
      following lines, in the Navigator 2.0 browser,
      <tt class=literal>person.name</tt> is the same as
      <tt class=literal>person[0]</tt>, and
      <tt class=literal>person.address</tt> is the same as
      <tt class=literal>person[1]</tt>:
      

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
person = new Object();
person.name = "david";
person.address = "somewhere on the internet";
</PRE>
</DIV>


    

<p class=para>
      If there are already some array elements defined in the object,
      then a new property takes up the element after the highest
      element already defined (even if there are undefined elements
      with lower indexes). So in the following code, in Navigator 2.0,
      <tt class=literal>address.zip</tt> is the same as
      <tt class=literal>address[4]</tt>:
      

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
address = new Object();
address[3] = "Anytown, USA";
address.zip = 22222;
</PRE>
</DIV>


    

<p class=para>
      The implication of all this is that if you define properties and
      later set array elements (for example, <tt class=literal>address[4] =
	66666</tt>), you may inadvertently be overwriting the value
      of your properties. This can lead to strange bugs that are
      difficult to find.
    

<p class=para>
      Note that if, for any given object, you use only object
      properties, or 
      
      only array elements, then you won't encounter this overlap
      problem. But, as we've seen, it is common to use a
      <tt class=literal>length</tt> property (or a <tt class=literal>size</tt>
      property) in conjunction with arrays. We must be careful to do
      this correctly. The convention for most Navigator 2.0
      JavaScript code is to use array element 0 to hold the
      <tt class=literal>length</tt> property, and then to begin the array
      contents themselves with element 1. Thus, in Navigator 2.0 it
      is common to see array constructors like the one we saw above:
    

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
function EmptyArray(length)
{
    this.size = length;
    for(var i = 1; i &lt;= length; i++)
        this[i] = 0;   
}
</PRE>
</DIV>

<p class=para>
      The crucial feature of this constructor is that it assigns a
      value to the <tt class=literal>size</tt>[3]
      property <i class=emphasis>before</I> it initializes any of the
      array elements. Creating this <tt class=literal>size</tt> property
      uses up element 0 of the array, so the loop initializes the
      array starting with element 1. If, instead, we had initialized
      the array and then set the <tt class=literal>size</tt> property,
      then that property would have been at the end of the array. If
      we later added more elements to the array, we would overwrite
      the value of <tt class=literal>size</tt>. Of course, if we know that
      our array has a fixed size and will never be made larger, then
      there would be no problem with doing it this way, and it allows
      us to begin the array with element 0 instead of element 1.
    

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[3] 
	  We use a <tt class=literal>size</tt> property here instead of
	  <tt class=literal>length</tt> to avoid confusion with Navigator
	  3.0 arrays that have an automatically updated
	  <tt class=literal>length</tt> property. By using a different
	  name we won't expect the property to be automatically updated.
	
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
      As we've seen, another difference between arrays in Navigator
      2.0 and 3.0 is that in Navigator 3.0, arrays created with the
      <tt class=literal>Array()</tt> constructor have their
      <tt class=literal>length</tt> property automatically updated when
      new elements are added to the array. If you need this feature in
      Navigator 2.0, you'll have to implement it yourself. You can do
      it with code like this:
      

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
a[i] = j;
if (i &gt; a.size) a.size = i;
</PRE>
</DIV>


      Note that this code fragment assumes the array begins
      with an index of 1, not 0.
    

<p class=para>
      Despite all this discussion of the array <tt class=literal>length</tt>
      property, and the ways to simulate it in Navigator 2.0, don't
      forget that there are many algorithms and uses for arrays in which
      a <tt class=literal>size</tt> or <tt class=literal>length</tt> property is
      not necessary. When this is possible, you can simply not bother
      with a <tt class=literal>size</tt> property. If your array has no
      object properties assigned, you don't have to worry about about
      overwriting array elements. And when your algorithm does require
      you to keep track of the size of your array, an obvious
      alternative to a <tt class=literal>size</tt> property is to maintain
      the array length in a separate variable, independent of the
      array. This also avoids the problem of properties overwriting
      elements. 
    

<p class=para>
      Finally, one further feature of arrays in Navigator 2.0 is that
      they can be indexed using object notation. Just as object
      properties can be accessed with the <tt class=literal>.</tt> operator
      and a literal property name or the <tt class=literal>[]</tt> operator
      and a property name expressed as a string, so too can Navigator
      2.0 arrays be accessed with either operator. When using the
      traditional array <tt class=literal>[]</tt> operator, the index can be
      any expression that evaluates to a positive integer. When using
      the <tt class=literal>.</tt> operator, the index must be an integer
      literal. So, in Navigator 2.0, the expression
      <tt class=literal>a.2</tt> is legal and is equivalent to
      <tt class=literal>a[2]</tt>. Using the <tt class=literal>.</tt> operator
      is not at all recommended--this bizarre feature of the language is
      deprecated, and has been removed in Navigator 3.0.
