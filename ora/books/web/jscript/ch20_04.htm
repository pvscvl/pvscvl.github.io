<p class=para>
<a name="CH20.TAINT1"></A><a name="CH20.TAINT2"></A>      The security model adopted by Navigator 2.0 and 3.0 is functional,
      but suffers from a number of problems. As we've seen, the
      "identify and hobble" approach is not very good at identifying
      security holes in the first place, and in a complex system like
      Navigator plus JavaScript, security holes can be difficult to
      find. Furthermore, hobbling JavaScript reduces the functionality
      available to developers. Some hobbles, while essential for
      security, end up breaking perfectly good scripts that pose no
      security threat and that ran correctly on earlier versions of the
      browser.
    

<p class=para>
      The hobble that prevents one script from reading the contents of a
      window from another server is a particularly draconian example.
      This hobble means that I cannot write a debugger program in
      JavaScript and post it on my web site for other developers to use
      on their own JavaScript programs. Developers would have to go
      through the extra step of downloading the debugging script and
      installing it on their own site, so that it can successfully
      examine the properties of the documents to be debugged.
      Similarly, this hobble prevents the creation of JavaScript
      programs that "crawl" the Web, recursively following links from a
      given starting page.
    

<p class=para>
      Because of the problems with hobbles, and with the theoretical
      underpinnings of security through hobbling, the developers at
      Netscape have created an entirely new security model. This new
      model is experimental in Navigator 3.0, and may be enabled by the
      end user through a procedure outlined later in this section. The
      new security model is theoretically much stronger, and should be a
      big advance for JavaScript security if it is enabled by default in
      Navigator 4.0. The following subsections explain this new model.
      Be aware in advance that this is a confusing model and can be
      difficult to understand.
    

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch20-SECT2-AUTOID.3">Data Tainting in Theory</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	Let's back up a bit and reconsider the security problem we are
	worried about in the first place. For the most part, the
	problem is that private data may be sent across the Web by
	malicious JavaScript programs. The hobbling approach to
	security generally patches this problem by preventing JavaScript
	programs from accessing private data. Unfortunately, this
	approach rules out non-malicious JavaScript programs that would
	like to use that private data without exporting it. One such
	program, for example, might be a navigation aid that generates a
	list of all the links from a web page and displays them in a
	separate window or frame.
      

<p class=para>
	Instead of preventing scripts from reading private data, a
	better approach would be to prevent them from exporting it,
	since this is what we are trying to prevent in the first place.
	If we could do this, then we could lift most of the hobbles that
	were detailed in the sections above. (We'd still need some
	hobbles, to prevent a program from closing windows it didn't
	open, for example.) Unfortunately, preventing the export of
	private data can be tricky to do, because not only must we
	prevent a script from exporting private data directly, be we must
	also prevent it from exporting data derived, in any way, from private
	data. If you think through the implications, you can see that
	keeping track of the data that must not be exported could be a
	very difficult proposition.
      

<p class=para>
	This is where the concept of data tainting comes in. The idea
	is that all JavaScript data values are given a flag. This flag
	indicates if the value is "tainted" (private) or not. Tainted
	values will be allowed to be exported only in certain very
	restricted ways. Untainted values can be exported arbitrarily.
	But any value, regardless of taint, can be manipulated by the
	program, which is a big improvement over the heavy-handed
	measures required by the hobbling approach. As the term
	"tainted" implies, any data derived from tainted data will
	itself be tainted. If a tainted string is added to a
	non-tainted string, the resulting string is tainted. If a
	tainted value is passed to a function, then the return value of
	the function is tainted. If a string is tainted, then any
	substring of the string is also tainted.
      

<p class=para>
	Theoretically, the data-tainting model is a strong one, and it
	has been proven practical in the Perl programming language.
	With a careful and rigorous implementation of tainting,
	Navigator will be able to prevent private data, or any modified
	version of private data from being incorrectly exported by a
	JavaScript program. Because data tainting is a uniform security
	model that covers all possible exports of data, we can also
	trust its security much further than we would trust the
	"identify a hole and patch it with a hobble" model.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch20-SECT2-AUTOID.4">Data Tainting in JavaScript</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	To really understand the data-tainting security model in
	JavaScript, you must understand what the taint flag indicates.
	In fact, this "flag" is better described as an "accumulator"
	because there are many possible types of taint, and any value
	can be tainted in more than one way. Entries in the history
	array, for example, are tainted in a way that indicates "this is
	private data and must not be exported in any way." On the other
	hand, in a document loaded from
	<i class=emphasis>server.xyz.com</I> data values in an HTML form
	are tainted in a way that indicates "this data belongs to
	<i class=emphasis>server.xyz.com</I>, and it must not be exported
	anywhere except to that server". When taint propagates from a
	tainted value to a derived value, this meaning propagates with
	it, of course. 
      

<p class=para>
	As we can see, tainting does not prevent all tainted data from
	being exported; it merely prevents it from being exported to a
	server that does not already "own" it. Furthermore, tainting
	does not even absolutely prevent data from being sent where it
	shouldn't be; it only prevents it from automatically being sent
	there. Whenever an attempt to export data violates the tainting
	rules, the user will be prompted with a dialog box asking them
	whether the export should be allowed. If they so choose, they
	can allow the export.
      

<p class=para>
	Consider how this might work. If a malicious script tries to
	export the URLs contained in the History object, JavaScript will
	see that these values are tainted in a way that does not allow
	them to be exported in any way, and will not allow the export.
	On the other hand, when a web page contains an HTML form, the
	user input values will be tainted in such a way that allows them
	to be exported back to the server form which the form was
	loaded. But if a malicious script running in another window
	attempts to spy on that HTML form and makes copies of the user's
	input, those copied values will still carry a taint value that
	identifies them as belonging to their original server. If the
	malicious scripts attempts to export them to its own malicious
	server, the attempt will fail because the taint values indicate
	that that server does not own that data.
      

<p class=para>
	It is not only data values that can carry taint. JavaScript
	functions and methods can carry taint as well. If a function or
	method is tainted, then its return value will automatically be
	tainted, regardless of the taintedness of its arguments. For
	example, the <tt class=literal>toString()</tt> method of the
	Location object and of the Text and Textarea objects are tainted
	because these methods return data that is private.
      

<p class=para>
	Functions are actually just another datatype in JavaScript, so
	it is not surprising that they can carry taint. What is
	surprising is that JavaScript programs themselves can become
	tainted. If a tainted value is used in an expression that is
	tested as part of an <tt class=literal>if</tt>,
	<tt class=literal>while</tt> or <tt class=literal>for</tt> statement,
	then the script itself must carry taint. If not, it would be
	easy to "launder" taint from a value with code like the
	following:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> b is a tainted Boolean value that we want to export</i></tt>
if (b == true) newb = true;
else newb = false;
//<tt class=replaceable><i> Now newb has the same value as b, but is not tainted, so we could </i></tt>
//<tt class=replaceable><i> export it if this script itself did not become tainted in the process.</i></tt>
</PRE>
</DIV>


	When a script becomes tainted, the window that contains it
	"accumulates" the same taint values, with the same meanings,
	that data values do. If a window carries taint, it will not be
	allowed to export data to a server unless the script's taint
	code and the data's taint code both indicate that they belong to
	the server.
      

<p class=para>
	In addition to understanding the different types of taint that
	are possible, you should also understand just what is meant by
	"exporting" data. In general terms, this means sending data
	over the Net. In practical terms, it occurs when a form is
	submitted in any way, or when a new URL is requested in any way.
	It is obvious that form submission exports data, but is less
	obvious that requesting a new document exports data. Bear in
	mind though that arbitrary data can be encoded into a URL
	following a question mark or hash sign (#). Also, the file and
	path of a URL can encode information.
      

<p class=para>
	While the data-tainting model is relatively straightforward on
	the surface, a working implementation requires careful attention
	to detail. JavaScript propagates taint through the strings of
	code passed to the <tt class=literal>eval()</tt> and
	<tt class=literal>setTimeout()</tt> functions, for example, so that
	you cannot untaint a value simply by converting it to a string
	of JavaScript code and executing that code later. Similarly,
	JavaScript propagates taint through the
	<tt class=literal>document.write()</tt> method so that a script
	can't launder tainted values by writing them out into a new
	script in a new window. For the same reason, JavaScript
	propagates taint through <tt class=literal>javascript:</tt> URLs,
	and prevents tainted strings from being stored in cookies.
	JavaScript also prevents data from being laundered through
	LiveConnect. In Navigator 3.0, this happens in a heavy-handed
	way: all data retrieved from Java is automatically tainted.

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch20-SECT2-AUTOID.5">Enabling Data Tainting in Navigator 3.0</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	As noted above, the data-tainting security model is experimental
	in Navigator 3.0, and is not enabled by default. It is expected
	to be the default security model in version 4.0 of Navigator,
	however. If you want to try using data tainting with Navigator
	3.0, you must enable it by setting an environment variable
	before starting Navigator. On Unix systems, do this with
	the following command in <i class=emphasis>csh</I>:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
setenv NS_ENABLE_TAINT 1
</PRE>
</DIV>


	On Windows platforms, enable taint with a set command in the
	<i class=emphasis>autoexec.bat</I> file or in NT user settings:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
set NS_ENABLE_TAINT=1
</PRE>
</DIV>


	And on the Macintosh, use the resource editor to edit the
	resource with type "Envi" and number 128 in the Netscape
	application. Modify this resource by removing the two slashes
	(<tt class=literal>//</tt>) before the
	<tt class=literal>NS_ENABLE_TAINT</tt> at the end of the string.
      

<p class=para>
	Note that if you enable this security model, you may find that
	many more scripts than you expect produce taint violations, and
	you'll spend a lot of time responding to dialogs that ask you to
	confirm form submissions or new page requests. One of the main
	reasons that tainting was not enabled in Navigator 3.0 was that
	the user interface to support it well was not yet ready. Thus,
	for Navigator 4.0, we can hope to see a smoother UI that does
	not ask as many questions.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch20-SECT2-AUTOID.7">The taint() and untaint() Functions</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	<a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-SECURITY-TAB-1">Table 20.1</A> shows the object
	properties and methods that are tainted by default in Navigator
	3.0. This list is not the final word on tainting. If a script
	would like to prevent other data it owns from being exported, it
	may taint that data with the <tt class=literal>taint()</tt> method.
	Similarly, if a script would like to relax the data-tainting
	rules in order to allow information it owns to be exported more
	freely, it can remove its taint from a value with the
	<tt class=literal>untaint()</tt> method.
      

<p class=para>
	There are some important things to note about these functions.
	First, both <tt class=literal>taint()</tt> and
	<tt class=literal>untaint()</tt> return a tainted or untainted copy
	of primitive vales or a tainted or untainted
	<i class=emphasis>reference</I> to objects and arrays. In
	JavaScript, taint is carried by references to objects, not by
	the objects themselves. So when you untaint an object, what you
	are really doing is untainting a reference to that object, not
	the object itself. The object's value may be exported through
	the untainted reference but not through the tainted reference.
      

<p class=para>
	The second point to note is that a script can use
	<tt class=literal>untaint()</tt> only to remove its own taint from
	a value. If a value X carries taint that identifies it as
	owned by server A, then a script running in a document from
	server B may call <tt class=literal>untaint()</tt> on value X but
	will not succeed in removing server A's taint, and will not be
	able to export that value to server B.
      

<p class=para>
	Finally, if <tt class=literal>taint()</tt> and
	<tt class=literal>untaint()</tt> are called with no argument, then
	they add and remove taint from the script rather than from a
	particular object. Again, a script can only remove its own
	taint from itself: if a script from server A has tainted itself
	by examining tainted data owned by server B, then server A
	cannot remove that taint from itself.
