<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="ch07-SECT1-AUTOID.6">7.6 Objects as Associative Arrays</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH07.ARRAY1"></A><a name="CH07.ARRAY2"></A><a name="CH07.ARRAY3"></A>      We've seen the <tt class=literal>.</tt> operator used to access the
      properties of an object. It is also possible to use the
      <tt class=literal>[]</tt> operator, more commonly used with
      arrays, to access these properties. Thus, the following two
      JavaScript expressions have the same value:
      

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
object.property
object["property"]
</PRE>
</DIV>


      The important difference to note between these two syntaxes is
      that in the first, the property name is an identifier, and in
      the second, the property name is a string. We'll see why this is
      so important below.
    

<p class=para>
      In C, C++, Java, and similar strongly typed languages an object
      can have only a fixed number of properties (or "fields," as
      they're often called), and the names of these properties must be
      defined in advance. Since JavaScript is a loosely typed
      language, this rule does not apply--a program can create
      any number of properties in any object. When you use the
      <tt class=literal>.</tt> operator to access a property of an object,
      however, the name of the property is expressed as an identifier,
      and identifiers must be "hardcoded" into your JavaScript
      program. That is, identifiers are not a JavaScript data type;
      they must be typed literally into a JavaScript program, and
      cannot be manipulated by the program.
    

<p class=para>
      On the other hand, when you access a property of an object with
      the <tt class=literal>[]</tt> array notation, the name of
      the property is expressed as a string. Strings are JavaScript
      data types, and they can be manipulated and created while a
      program is running. So, for example, you could write the
      following code in JavaScript:
      

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
var addr = "";
for(i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    addr += customer["address" + i]
}
</PRE>
</DIV>


      This code fragment reads and concatenates the properties
      <tt class=literal>address0</tt>, <tt class=literal>address1</tt>,
      <tt class=literal>address2</tt>, and <tt class=literal>address3</tt> of
      the <tt class=literal>customer</tt> object.
    

<p class=para>
      The code fragment above demonstrates the flexibility of using
      array notation to access properties of an object with string
      expressions. We could have actually written that example using
      the <tt class=literal>.</tt> notation, but there are cases for which
      only the array notation will do. Suppose, for example, that you
      are writing a program that uses network resources to compute the
      current value of the user's stock market investments. The program
      allows the user to type in the name of each stock they own, and
      also the number of shares of each stock. You might use an object
      named <tt class=literal>portfolio</tt> to hold this information. The
      object would have one property for each stock; the name of the
      property would be the name of the stock, and the property value
      would be the number of shares of that stock. So, for example, if
      a user held 50 shares of stock in Netscape Communications Corp.,
      then the <tt class=literal>portfolio.nscp</tt> property would have the
      value <tt class=literal>50</tt>.
    

<p class=para>
      One part of this program would be a loop that prompts the user to
      enter the name of a stock they own, and then asks them to enter
      the number of shares they own of that stock. Inside the loop,
      you'd have code something like the following:
      

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
stock_name = get_stock_name_from_user();
shares = get_number_of_shares();
portfolio[stock_name] = shares;
</PRE>
</DIV>


      Since the user enters stock names at run-time, there is no way
      that you can know the property names ahead of time. Since you
      can't know the property names when you write the program, there is
      no way you can use the <tt class=literal>.</tt> operator to access the
      properties of the <tt class=literal>portfolio</tt> object. You can
      use the <tt class=literal>[]</tt> operator, however, because it uses a
      string value (which is dynamic and can change at run-time), rather
      than an identifier (which static and must be hard-coded in the
      program), to name the property.
    

<p class=para>
      When an object is used this fashion, it is often called an
      <i class=emphasis>associative array</I>--a data structure that
      allows you to dynamically associate arbitrary data values with
      arbitrary strings. JavaScript objects are actually implemented
      internally as associative arrays. The <tt class=literal>.</tt>
      notation for accessing properties makes them seem like the static
      objects of C++ and Java, and they work perfectly well in that
      capacity. But they also have the very powerful ability to
      associate values with arbitrary strings. In this respect,
      JavaScript objects are much more like Perl arrays than like C++ or
      Java objects.
    

<p class=para>
      <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, <i>Statements</i></A>,
      introduced the <tt class=literal>for/in</tt> loop. The real power of
      this JavaScript statement becomes clear when we consider its use
      with an associative array. To return to the stock portfolio
      example, we might use code that looked like the following after
      the user had entered her portfolio and we were computing its
      current total value:
      

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
value = 0;
for (stock_name in portfolio) {  //<tt class=replaceable><i> for each stock in the portfolio</i></tt>
    //<tt class=replaceable><i> get the per share value and multiply it by the number of shares</i></tt>
    value += get_share_value(stock_name) * portfolio[stock_name];
}
</PRE>
</DIV>


      We couldn't write this code without the
      <tt class=literal>for/in</tt> loop, because the names of the stocks
      aren't known in advance, and this is the only way to extract
      those property names from the associative array (i.e.,
      JavaScript object) named <tt class=literal>portfolio</tt>.
