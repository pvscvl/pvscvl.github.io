<h2 class=sect1><a class="TITLE" name="ch04-SECT1-AUTOID.7">4.7 Bitwise Operators</A></h2>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH04.BIT1"></A><a name="CH04.BIT2"></A>      Despite the fact that all numbers in JavaScript are
      floating-point, the bitwise operators require numeric operands
      that have integral values. They operate on these integer operands
      using a 32-bit integer representation instead of the equivalent
      floating-point representation. These operators may return
      <tt class=literal>NaN</tt> if used with operands which are not
      integers or which are too large to fit in a 32-bit integer
      representation. Four of these operators perform
      Boolean algebra on the individual bits of the operands, behaving
      as if each bit in each operand was a Boolean value and performing
      similar operands to the logical operators we saw earlier. The
      other three bitwise operators are used to shift bits left and
      right.
    

<p class=para>
      If you are not familiar with binary numbers and the binary
      representation of decimal integers, you can skip the operators
      described in this section. The purpose of these operators is not
      described here; they are used for low-level manipulation of binary
      numbers and are not commonly used in JavaScript programming.
    

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch04-SECT2-AUTOID.22">Bitwise And (<tt class=replaceable><i>&amp;</i></tt>)</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	The <tt class=literal>&amp;</tt> operator performs a Boolean AND
	operation on each bit of its integer arguments. A bit is set in
	the result only if the corresponding bit is set in both
	operands.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch04-SECT2-AUTOID.23">Bitwise Or (|)</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	The <tt class=literal>|</tt> operator performs a Boolean OR
	operation on each bit of its integer arguments. A bit is set in
	the result if the corresponding bit is set in one or both of the
	operands.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch04-SECT2-AUTOID.24">Bitwise Xor (^)</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	The <tt class=literal>^</tt> operator performs a Boolean "exclusive
	OR" operation on each bit of its integer argument. Exclusive OR
	means either operand one is true or operand two is true, but not
	both. A bit is set in the result of this operation if a
	corresponding bit is set in one (but not both) of the two
	operands.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch04-SECT2-AUTOID.25">Bitwise Not (~)</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	The <tt class=literal>~</tt> operator is a unary operator that
	appears before its single integer argument. It operates by
	reversing all bits in the operand. Because of how signed
	integers are represented in JavaScript, applying the
	<tt class=literal>~</tt> operator to a value is equivalent to
	changing its sign and subtracting 1.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch04-SECT2-AUTOID.26">Shift Left (&lt;&lt;)</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	The <tt class=literal>&lt;&lt;</tt> operator moves all bits in its
	first operand to the left by the number of places specified in
	the second operand, which should be an integer between 1 and
	31. For example, in the operation <tt class=literal>a &lt;&lt;
	1</tt>, the first bit (the ones bit) of
	<tt class=literal>a</tt> becomes the second bit (the twos bit), the
	second bit of <tt class=literal>a</tt> becomes the third, etc. A
	zero is used for the new first bit, and the value of the 32nd
	bit is lost. Shifting a value left by one position is equivalent
	to multiplying by 2. Shifting two positions is equivalent to
	multiplying by 4, and so on.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch04-SECT2-AUTOID.27">Shift Right with Sign (&gt;&gt;)</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	The <tt class=literal>&gt;&gt;</tt> operator moves all bits in its
	first operand to the right by the number of places specified in
	the second operand (an integer between 1 and 31). Bits that are
	shifted off the right are lost. The bits filled in on the left
	are the same as the sign bit of the original operand
	to preserve the sign of the result: If the first operand
	is positive, the result will have zeros filled in the high
	bits; if the first operand is negative, the result will have
	ones filled in the high bits. Shifting a value right one
	place is equivalent to dividing by two (discarding the
	remainder), shifting right two places is equivalent to integer
	division by four, and so on.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch04-SECT2-AUTOID.28">Shift Right Zero Fill (&gt;&gt;&gt;)</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	The <tt class=literal>&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> operator is just like the
	<tt class=literal>&gt;&gt;</tt> operator, except that the bits
	shifted in on the left are always zero, regardless of the sign
	of the first operand.
