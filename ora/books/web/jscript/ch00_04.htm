<p class=para>
      Writing this book would not have been nearly as exciting if
      Brendan Eich and his team at Netscape had not kept adding new
      features as I wrote!  I, and many JavaScript developers, owe
      Brendan a tremendous debt of gratitude for developing JavaScript,
      and for taking the time out of his crazy schedule to answer our
      questions and even solicit our input. Besides patiently answering
      my many questions, Brendan also read and provided helpful comments
      on the beta edition of this book.
    

<p class=para>
      Nick Thompson and Richard Yaker at Netscape were also very helpful
      during the development of the book. Nick answered many of my
      questions about LiveConnect, and took the time to review and
      comment on a draft of <a href="ch19_01.htm">Chapter 19, <i>LiveConnect: JavaScript and Java</i></A>.
      Richard found answers for me to many miscellaneous questions, and
      also provided me with the list of known bugs that are described in
      <a href="appb_01.htm">Appendix B, <i>Known Bugs</i></A>. Lynn Rollins, a partner at
      R&amp;B Communications, and a contractor for Netscape, pointed out
      errors in the Beta edition of the book and also shared with me
      some of the less publicized features of JavaScript in Navigator
      3.0.
    

<p class=para>
      Much of my information about Internet Explorer comes from Shon
      Katzenberger Ph.D., Larry Sullivan, and Dave C. Mitchell, three of
      the primary developers of Microsoft's version of JavaScript. Shon
      and Larry are the Software Design Engineers who developed
      Microsoft's version of the JavaScript interpreter and Microsoft's
      version of the JavaScript client-side object model, respectively.
      Dave was the Test Lead for the project. All three reviewed the
      Beta edition of the book and provided me a wealth of information
      about Internet Explorer that was simply lacking before. Dave was
      particularly helpful in answering my last minute questions about
      IE's capabilities.
    

<p class=para>
      Neil Berkman, a software engineer at Bay Networks in Billerica,
      MA, as well as Andrew Schulman and Terry Allen at O'Reilly were
      technical reviewers for the Beta edition. Their comments made
      that edition (and therefore this one) stronger and more accurate.
      Andrew was also the editor for the Beta edition of this book, and
      Frank Willison is editor of the current edition. I am grateful to
      them both.
    

<p class=para>
      David Futato was the production manager for this edition of the
      book and the last. He coordinated the whole process of
      production, and for the Beta edition, it was he who worked
      weekends and nights in order to give me time to squeeze the last
      few new Beta 6 features in.
      Chris Reilley produced the figures for the book. Edie Freedman
      designed the cover, and Nancy Priest and Mary Jane Walsh
      designed the internal format, which was implemented by Lenny
      Muellner, with help from Erik Ray.  Seth Maislin indexed this book.
    

<p class=para>
      Finally, my thanks, as always
      and for so many reasons, to Christie.
