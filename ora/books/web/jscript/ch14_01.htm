 <a name="CH14.DOC1"></A>
      If the Window object, which represents a window or a frame, is the
      central object in client-side JavaScript, then the Document
      object, which represents the contents of a window or frame, runs a
      close second, and is just as commonly used. This object has
      properties that specify information about the document: the URL,
      its last-modified date, the URL of the document that linked to it,
      the colors that it is displayed in. The Document object also has
      a few methods that allow JavaScript programs to dynamically output
      text into a document, and to dynamically create new documents from
      scratch. Finally, the Document object also contains a number of
      array properties that specify information about the contents of
      the document. These arrays contain objects that represent the
      links, anchors, HTML forms, applets, and embedded data contained
      in the document. These arrays and the objects they contain are
      very important in JavaScript programming, and will be described in
      their own sections later in this chapter.
    

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch14-SECT2-AUTOID.1">Document Properties</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	The Document object has a number of properties that correspond
	to attributes of the <tt class=literal>&lt;BODY&gt;</tt> tag, and
	which are used to specify the colors that the document is
	displayed in. The <tt class=literal>bgColor</tt> property, and the
	<tt class=literal>BGCOLOR</tt> attribute specify the background
	color of the document. Similarly, the
	<tt class=literal>fgColor</tt> and the <tt class=literal>TEXT</tt>
	attribute specify the default color for text in the document.
	The <tt class=literal>linkColor</tt> property specifies the color of
	unvisited links, and <tt class=literal>vlinkColor</tt> and
	<tt class=literal>alinkColor</tt>[1]
	specify the color of visited links
	and of activated links (i.e., links currently being
	clicked on). The <tt class=literal>LINK</tt>,
	<tt class=literal>VLINK</tt>, and <tt class=literal>ALINK</tt>
	attributes correspond to these properties.
      

<blockquote class=footnote>
<p class=para>[1] 
	    You can set the <tt class=literal>alinkColor</tt> property in
	    Internet Explorer, but it will be ignored, since IE never
	    displays a separate color for activated links.
	  
</blockquote>
<p class=para>
	These color properties of the Document object are read/write
	properties, but they can only be set before the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;BODY&gt;</tt> tag is parsed. You can set them
	dynamically with JavaScript code in the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;HEAD&gt;</tt> of a document, or you can set
	them statically as attributes of the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;BODY&gt;</tt> tag, but you cannot set them
	elsewhere.
      

<p class=para>
	The exception to this rule is the <tt class=literal>bgColor</tt>
	property. You can set this property at any time, and doing so
	will cause the background color of the browser to change.
	Unfortunately, on Unix platforms, changing the background color
	can make the contents of the page disappear (usually until the
	window is scrolled or otherwise redrawn). Setting the
	background color can still produce a useful special effect when
	done with small, empty frames, however.
      

<p class=para>
	Each of these color properties has a string value. To set a
	color, you can use one of the predefined color names listed in
	<a href="appg_01.htm">Appendix G, <i>JavaScript and HTML Color Names and Values</i></A>, or you can specify the
	color as red, green, and blue color values, expressed as a
	string of six hexadecimal digits in the form
	"<tt class=replaceable><i>RRGGBB</i></tt>".
      

<p class=para>
	The Document object also has properties that are somewhat more
	interesting than these color properties. For the most part, the
	values of these other properties are derived from the HTML content
	of the document or from HTML headers supplied by the web server.
	As we saw in the discussion of the Location object, the Document
	object has a <tt class=literal>location</tt> property (and a
	<tt class=literal>URL</tt> property which is a preferred synonym in
	Navigator 3.0) that specifies the URL of the document. Because
	of redirection performed by the web server, this URL may be
	different than the requested URL.
      

<p class=para>
	The <tt class=literal>lastModified</tt> property is a string that
	specifies the date and time of the most recent change to the
	document. This is a value supplied by some, but not all, web
	servers. The <tt class=literal>referrer</tt> property specifies the
	URL of the document that contained the hypertext link that the
	user clicked on to get to the current document. If the current
	document was loaded by explicitly typing a URL, then this
	property will be empty. Note that this property is not
	supported in Internet Explorer 3.0. Finally, the
	<tt class=literal>title</tt> property contains any text that appears
	between the <tt class=literal>&lt;TITLE&gt;</tt> and
	<tt class=literal>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</tt> tags in the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;HEAD&gt;</tt> of the document. You cannot use
	this property, of course, in code that appears before the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;TITLE&gt;</tt> of a document.
      

<p class=para>
	A simple use for the <tt class=literal>lastModified</tt> property is
	to automatically include a timestamp in your documents, so that
	users know whether the information they are seeing is
	up to date. You can do this by including HTML and JavaScript
	code like the following at the bottom of all your documents.
	Note that this code displays the document title and URL as well
	as its modification date:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;HR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;
Document: &lt;I&gt;&lt;SCRIPT&gt;document.write(document.title);&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
URL: &lt;I&gt;&lt;SCRIPT&gt;document.write(document.URL);&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Last Update: &lt;I&gt;&lt;SCRIPT&gt;document.write(document.lastModified);&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;/FONT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>


      

<p class=para>
	A possible use for the <tt class=literal>referrer</tt> property is
	to save this value in a hidden field of a form on your web
	page. When the user submits the form (for whatever reason your
	page contains the form in the first place) you can save this
	referrer data on the server. This will allow you to analyze
	what links exist to your page, and also what percentage of hits
	come through which links. Another use of this property is a trick
	to prevent unauthorized links to your page from working
	correctly. For example, if you only want users to be able to
	get to your page through links in pages from one particular
	site, you might use code like this at the top of your page:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
if (document.referrer == "" || document.referrer.indexOf("mysite.com") == -1)
    window.location = "javascript:'You can't get there from here!'";
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>


	Don't consider this trick to be any kind of serious security
	measure, of course. Anyone determined to read your pages could
	simply disable JavaScript in their browser, and then load the
	page. 
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch14-SECT2-AUTOID.2">The write() Method</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH14.WRITE1"></A>	Without a doubt, the most important feature of the Document
	object (and perhaps of client-side JavaScript in general) is the
	<tt class=literal>write()</tt> method, which allows us to
	dynamically generate web page content from our JavaScript
	programs. There are several ways that this method can be used.
	The most obvious is to use it within a script to output HTML
	into the document that is currently being parsed. This is the
	way it was used above to display the Document
	<tt class=literal>lastModified</tt> property at the bottom of the
	web page. Be aware that you can only output HTML to the current
	document while that document is being parsed. That is, you can
	only call <tt class=literal>document.write()</tt> from within
	<tt class=literal>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt> tags, because these scripts
	are executed as part of the document parsing process. In
	particular, if you call <tt class=literal>document.write()</tt> from
	an event handler, you will end up overwriting the current
	document (including its event handlers), instead of appending
	text to it.
      

<p class=para>
	Although you can't usefully write to the current document from
	an event handler, there is no reason you can't write to a
	document in another window or frame, and doing so can be a very
	useful technique for multiwindow or multiframe web sites. For
	example, JavaScript code in one frame of a multiframe site
	might display a message in another frame with code like this:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
parent.frames[0].document.open();
parent.frames[0].document.write("&lt;HRE&gt;Hello from your sibling frame!&lt;HR&gt;");
parent.frames[0].document.close();
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>


      

<p class=para>
	We previously saw code that dynamically creates an HTML document
	like this in <a href="ch12_02.htm">Example 12-2</A> and <a href="ch12_04.htm">Example 12-6</A>. Recall that to create a new
	document, we first call the <tt class=literal>open()</tt> method of
	the Document object, then call <tt class=literal>write()</tt> any
	number of times to output the contents of the document, and
	finally call the <tt class=literal>close()</tt> method of the
	Document object to indicate that we are complete. This last
	step is important--if you forget to close the document, the
	browser will not stop the "document loading" animation it
	displays. Also, the browser may buffer up the HTML you have
	written, and is not required to display it until you explicitly
	end the document by calling <tt class=literal>close()</tt>.
      

<p class=para>
	In contrast to the <tt class=literal>close()</tt> call, which is
	required, the <tt class=literal>open()</tt> call is optional. If
	you call the <tt class=literal>write()</tt> method on a document
	that has already been closed, then JavaScript implicitly opens a
	new HTML document, as if you called the
	<tt class=literal>open()</tt> method. This explains what happens
	when you call <tt class=literal>document.write()</tt> from an
	event handler within the same document--JavaScript opens a new
	document. In the process, however, the current document and its
	contents, including scripts and event handlers, is discarded.
	In Navigator 3.0, this causes surprising programming difficulties
	and unexpected error messages. In Navigator 2.0, it can
	actually cause the browser to crash. The best rule of thumb is
	that a document should never call <tt class=literal>write()</tt> on
	itself from within an event-handler.
      

<p class=para>
	A couple of final notes about the <tt class=literal>write()</tt>
	method. First, many people do not realize that the
	<tt class=literal>write()</tt> method can take more than one
	argument. When you pass multiple arguments, they will be output
	one after another, just as if they had been concatenated. So
	instead of writing:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
document.write('Hello, '  + name + " Welcome to my home page!");
</PRE>
</DIV>


	you can equivalently write:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
document.write('Hello, ', name, " Welcome to my home page!");
</PRE>
</DIV>


      

<p class=para>
	The second point to note about the <tt class=literal>write()</tt>
	method is that the Document object also supports a
	<tt class=literal>writeln()</tt> method, which is identical to the
	<tt class=literal>write()</tt> method in every way, except that it
	appends a newline after outputting its arguments. Since HTML
	ignores linebreaks, this newline character usually doesn't make
	a difference, but, as we'll see in a bit, the
	<tt class=literal>writeln()</tt> method can be convenient when
	working with non-HTML documents.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch14-SECT2-AUTOID.3">Flushing Generated Output</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	When you use the <tt class=literal>write()</tt> method to
	dynamically generate HTML output, the text you write may not
	appear in the browser window right away. The contents of your
	individual <tt class=literal>write()</tt> calls may be buffered up
	so that they can be written out to the document in larger
	chunks. Unfortunately, there is no <tt class=literal>flush()</tt>
	method of the Document object that forces all output to appear.
	Instead, you must know the necessary tricks to make your output
	appear. 
      

<p class=para>
	Calling the <tt class=literal>close()</tt> method is the simplest
	technique for forcing your output to be displayed, of course.
	Sometimes, though, you want intermediate output to be displayed,
	and are not yet ready to close the document you are generating.
	In this case, there are two techniques for flushing output. In
	Navigator 3.0, output is flushed whenever a new line is forced
	in the browser. Thus, if you output a
	<tt class=literal>&lt;BR&gt;</tt> or <tt class=literal>&lt;P&gt;</tt> or
	<tt class=literal>&lt;HR&gt;</tt> tag, all the text before that tag
	will appear. In Internet Explorer 3.0, it is not so easy,
	however--your output does not appear until the current
	<tt class=literal>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt> block ends or the current
	event handler function returns. Thus, for this browser, you may
	need to break your code up into smaller chunks in order to
	assure that output is correctly flushed. Note that you can
	always use <tt class=literal>setTimeout()</tt> to schedule the next
	"chunk" of code to run in 0 milliseconds. This technique allows
	control to temporarily return to IE so that it can display any
	pending output.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch14-SECT2-AUTOID.4">Non-HTML Documents</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH14.NON1"></A><a name="CH14.NON2"></A>	When you open a new document with the <tt class=literal>open()</tt>
	method, the browser assumes that you'll be creating an HTML
	document. But this is not necessarily the case. Web browsers
	can display a number of other data formats besides HTML text.
	When you want to dynamically create and display a document using
	some other data format, you call the <tt class=literal>open()</tt>
	method with a single argument, which is the MIME type you
	desire. Note that while this technique is supported in
	Navigator 2.0 and 3.0, it does not work in Internet Explorer
	3.0--in that browser, any argument passed to
	<tt class=literal>open()</tt> is ignored.
      

<p class=para>
	The MIME type for HTML is "text/html". The most common
	format other than HTML is plain text, with a MIME type of
	"text/plain". If you want to use the <tt class=literal>write()</tt>
	method to output text that uses newlines, spaces, and tab
	characters for formatting, then you should open the document by
	passing the string "text/plain" to the <tt class=literal>open()</tt>
	method. <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-DOCUMENTS-EX-1">Example 14-1</A> shows one
	way you might do this. It implements a
	<tt class=literal>debug()</tt> function that you can use to output
	plain-text debugging messages from your scripts into a separate
	window that appears when needed.
	<a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-DOCUMENTS-FIG-1">Figure 14-1</A> shows what the
	resulting window looks like.

&lt;/FORM&gt;

</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
	This technique of using non-HTML documents is not limited to
	plain-text documents, or to textual documents in general. It
	can also be used with images, for instance. If we open a
	document and specify the MIME type "image/xbm", for example,
	then the browser will expect the contents of that document to be
	an image in XBM format. Because XBM images have an ASCII
	representation, we can easily write a static XBM image to the
	document, or even generate a dynamic image on the fly (perhaps
	using a Java applet to do the image processing, for speed).
	<a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-DOCUMENTS-EX-2">Example 14-2</A> shows how you can
	create an "image/xbm" document with a static XBM image, and also
	shows how this XBM image can be used for image embedded in an
	HTML document. <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-DOCUMENTS-FIG-2">Figure 14-2</A> shows
	the windows created by the example. This technique would be
	much more efficient and interesting if it used a compact image
	format like "image/gif". Unfortunately, this is not possible
	because GIF images use a binary format that includes NULL
	characters (i.e., the byte 0) and the current versions of
	JavaScript cannot output this character.
