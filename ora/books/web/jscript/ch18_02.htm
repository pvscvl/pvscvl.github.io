<p class=para>
<a name="CH18.BROW1"></A><a name="CH18.BROW2"></A>      When a user without a JavaScript-capable browser visits your web
      pages, they obviously won't be able run your JavaScript programs.
      Therefore, your JavaScript scripts should fail gracefully when
      read into browsers that do not understand JavaScript. There are
      two components to this. First, they must not simply format and
      display your entire JavaScript program as if it was HTML text.
      And second, they should display a message informing the visitor
      that their browser cannot correctly handle the page. You can do
      both of these things with some carefully placed comments.
  

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch18-SECT2-AUTOID.6">Hiding Scripts from Old Browsers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
<a name="CH18.HID1"></A><a name="CH18.HID2"></A><a name="CH18.HID3"></A>	Web browsers that support JavaScript will execute the JavaScript
	statements that appear between the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt> and
	<tt class=literal>&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</tt> tags. Browsers that don't
	support JavaScript, but that recognize the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt> tag, will simply ignore
	everything between <tt class=literal>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt> and
	<tt class=literal>&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</tt>. This is as it should be.
	Other, older browsers, however (and there are a lot of them), do
	not recognize the <tt class=literal>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt> and
	<tt class=literal>&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</tt> tags, and so they ignore the
	tags themselves, and treat all the JavaScript between them as
	text to be displayed. Users of old browsers cannot run your
	JavaScript programs, and this should be punishment
	enough--they should not also have to look at your code!
      

<p class=para>
<a name="CH18.COM1"></A><a name="CH18.COM2"></A><a name="CH18.COM3"></A><a name="CH18.COM4"></A>
	In order to prevent this, you enclose the body of your
	scripts within an HTML comment, using the format shown in <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-COMPAT-EX-1">Example 18-1</A>. 
      

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JSCRIPT-CH-COMPAT-EX-1">Example 18-1: A Script Hidden from Old Browsers</A></h4>

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
1  &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
2  &lt;!-- begin HTML comment that hides the script
3          .
4          . JavaScript statements go here
5          .
6  // end HTML comment that hides the script --&gt;
7  &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
	Browsers that do not understand the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt> and
	<tt class=literal>&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</tt> tags simply ignore
	them. Thus, lines 1 and 7 in <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-COMPAT-EX-1">Example 18-1</A> have no effect on these
	browsers. They'll ignore lines 2 through 6 as well, because the
	first four characters on line 2 begin an HTML comment, and the
	last three characters on line 6 end that
	comment--everything between is ignored by the HTML parser.
      

<p class=para>
	This script-hiding technique also works for browsers that
	<i class=emphasis>do</I> support JavaScript. Lines 1 and 7
	indicate the beginning and ending of a script. As noted in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>Lexical Structure</i></A>, JavaScript-enabled web browsers
	recognize the HTML comment opening string
	<tt class=literal>&lt;!--</tt>, but treat it as a
	single-line comment. Thus, a browser with JavaScript support
	treats line 2 as a single-line comment. Similarly, line 6 begins
	with the <tt class=literal>//</tt> single-line comment string, so
	that line is ignored by JavaScript-enabled browsers as
	well. This leaves lines 3 through 5, which are executed as
	JavaScript statements.
      

<p class=para>
	While it takes a little getting used to, this simple and elegant
	mix of HTML and JavaScript comments do exactly what we
	need--prevent JavaScript code from being displayed by browsers
	that do not support JavaScript. You should get in the habit of
	using these comments with all your scripts. The comments need
	not be as verbose as this, of course. It is common to see
	scripts that look like this:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!-- begin hiding
  document.write(new Date());
// end hiding --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>


	It is also common to strip the English text out of the comments:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt; 
&lt;!-- 
  document.write(new Date());
// --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>


	When writing very short scripts, you can even compress them by
	removing some of the line breaks:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt; &lt;!--
  document.write(new Date());
// --&gt; &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>


	And even the following is legal:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt; &lt;!--
  document.write(new Date()); // --&gt; &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>


	The only rule to hiding JavaScript code with an HTML comment is
	that there must be a line break after the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;!--</tt> that opens the comment. Remember
	that this functions as a JavaScript comment, and comments out
	the remainder of the line. So the JavaScript interpreter won't
	run any code that follows it.
      

<p class=para>
	This commenting technique has solved the problem of hiding our
	JavaScript code from browsers that can't run it. The next step
	in failing gracefully is to display a message to the user
	letting them know that the page cannot run. The next
	sub-section shows how to accomplish this.
      

</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch18-SECT2-AUTOID.7">Notifying Users of Old Browsers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	In order to inform users of old browsers that their browser
	cannot successfully run the JavaScript programs on a web page we
	need some technique for displaying a message on an old browser
	but not displaying it on a JavaScript-capable browser. This
	would be easy if we could use a JavaScript
	<tt class=literal>if</tt> statement and the
	<tt class=literal>document.write()</tt> method  to display the
	message, but of course we can't do this if the browser doesn't
	understand JavaScript in the first place. So instead we again
	rely on HTML comments and take advantage of the fact that
	JavaScript treats HTML comments differently than HTML does.
      

<p class=para>
	JavaScript treats the <tt class=literal>&lt;!--</tt>
	sequence that begins an HTML comment as a single-line comment
	like <tt class=literal>//</tt>. This means that the following text
	is commented out in both HTML and in JavaScript:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- This text is commented out in HTML and JavaScript --&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>


	JavaScript doesn't recognize the <tt class=literal>--&gt;</tt>
	closing comment and doesn't care where it occurs, however, so
	the following text is commented out in JavaScript but not in HTML:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- --&gt; This text is commented out in JavaScript, but not in HTML.
</PRE>
</DIV>


	Herein lies the secret to displaying messages on non-JavaScript
	browsers but not on JavaScript-enabled browsers.
	<a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-COMPAT-EX-2">Example 18-2</A> shows what our
	JavaScript scripts might look like with our JavaScript code
	hidden from the HTML parser, as above, and with our
	HTML messages hidden from the JavaScript interpreter. 
      

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JSCRIPT-CH-COMPAT-EX-2">Example 18-2: Displaying a Message on Non-JavaScript Browsers</A></h4>

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!-- The message below will only display on non-JavaScript browsers --&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;HR&gt;&lt;H1&gt;This Page Requires JavaScript&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt; Your web browser is not capable of running JavaScript programs,
&lt;!-- --&gt; so you will not be able to use this page. Please consider
&lt;!-- --&gt; upgrading to the latest version of either Netscape Navigator
&lt;!-- --&gt; or Microsoft Internet Explorer.
&lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;HR&gt;
&lt;!-- This HTML comment hides the script from non-JavaScript browsers
        .
        . JavaScript code goes here
        .
// This JavaScript comment is also the end of the HTML comment above. --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

<div class=sect2>
<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch18-SECT2-AUTOID.8">Hiding Scripts from Really Old Browsers</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	One flaw in the script-hiding scheme described above is that
	some older web browsers recognize the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;!--</tt> string to begin a comment,
	but then end the comment with a <tt class=literal>&gt;</tt>
	character alone, instead of looking for a complete
	<tt class=literal>--&gt;</tt> string. This means that if the
	<tt class=literal>&gt;</tt> character appears anywhere within your
	JavaScript code, either in a string, or as one of the
	<tt class=literal>&gt;</tt>, <tt class=literal>&gt;=</tt>,
	<tt class=literal>&gt;&gt;</tt> or <tt class=literal>&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt>
	operators, then the HTML parser for these older browsers will
	close the comment, and will treat the rest of your script as
	HTML text to be formatted and displayed.
      

<p class=para>
	There are two possible solutions to this problem. The first is
	to ignore it. Maybe being forced to look at your JavaScript code
	will encourage users of these really old browsers to upgrade to
	one that supports the correct HTML comment syntax!
	Unfortunately, the Lynx browser, prior to version 2.6, is one of
	the ones that has the problem.  This browser for text
	only terminals fills an important niche, and there are quite a
	few copies in use.  In version 2.6, comment syntax is no longer
	an issue for Lynx, because it now correctly recognizes the
	<tt class=literal>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt> tag and ignores anything
	between it and <tt class=literal>&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</tt>.
      

<p class=para>
	The only other solution to this problem is somewhat tedious and
	not entirely satisfactory. Since the problem is with the "&gt;"
	character appearing in your JavaScript code, the solution is to
	make sure that that character does not appear, at least not in
	its unescaped form. You can do this with the following rules:
      

<p>
<ul class=itemizedlist>
<li class=listitem>	    Anywhere <tt class=literal>&gt;</tt> appears within
	    a string, replace it with the characters
	    <tt class=literal>\076</tt>--this tells JavaScript
	    to use the character with the same encoding as the
	    <tt class=literal>&gt;</tt> character.
	  

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    Replace expressions of the form <tt class=literal>(a &gt;
	      b)</tt> with the equivalent <tt class=literal>(b &lt;=
	      a)</tt>.
	  

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    Replace expressions of the form <tt class=literal>(a &gt;=
	      b)</tt> with the equivalent <tt class=literal>(b &lt;
	      a)</tt>.
	  

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    Replace the <tt class=literal>&gt;&gt;</tt> and
	    <tt class=literal>&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> operators with division by
	    the appropriate power of 2, and with appropriate sign
	    manipulation. Fortunately, these operators are rarely used;
	    if you ever need to use them, you'll understand them well
	    enough to figure out the correct replacement.
	  

<p>
<li class=listitem>	    Do not try to replace the <tt class=literal>&gt;</tt> character
	    with the HTML escape <tt class=literal>&amp;gt;</tt>. The HTML
	    parser recognizes this string, but the JavaScript
	    interpreter doesn't.

<h3 class=sect2><a class="TITLE" name="ch18-SECT2-AUTOID.9">Falling Back to a Non-JavaScript Page</A></h3>

<p class=para>
	Sometimes, if a browser cannot run the scripts in one web page,
	you'd like to have it load some other page that does not use
	JavaScript. This page might be a CGI-based version of your
	program, for example, or it might simply contain static HTML
	content, formatted in a way that does not rely on embedded
	JavaScript.
      

<p class=para>
	Loading an alternate page would be easy if we could use
	JavaScript, but obviously, we can't. What we can do, however,
	instead of "falling back" on a non-JavaScript page is turn
	things around and "skip ahead" to a JavaScript page if
	JavaScript <i class=emphasis>is</I> supported. That is, we load
	the non-JavaScript page by default. This page will actually
	contain a short script. If the script runs, then JavaScript is
	supported, and the script uses the Location object to read
	in the JavaScript version of the page. <a href="#JSCRIPT-CH-COMPAT-EX-3">Example 18-3</A> shows an example HTML document
	using this technique.
      

<div class=example>
<h4 class=example><a class="TITLE" name="JSCRIPT-CH-COMPAT-EX-3">Example 18-3: Loading a JavaScript-Based Page Only if JavaScript Is Supported</A></h4>

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;    &lt;!-- hide script
location = "my_js_home_page.html";      // stop hiding --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;My Home Page (Non-JavaScript Version)&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;  
        .
        . Arbitrary, non-JavaScript HTML goes here 
        .
&lt;/BODY&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>

</DIV>

<p class=para>
	You can even automate this process. If every non-JavaScript
	web page in a directory has a JavaScript equivalent in a
	subdirectory named "js/", then you might use code like this at
	the top of a non-JavaScript page to load in the equivalent when
	JavaScript is supported:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT&gt;                        &lt;!-- hide script
  var path = location.path;
  var filename = path.substring(path.lastIndexOf("/")+1, path.length);
  location = "js/" + filename;  // stop hiding --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>


      

<p class=para>
	There is one shortcoming to the technique shown here. If the
	user loads a non-JavaScript page in a JavaScript-capable
	browser, the short initial script will take them to the full
	JavaScript page. This is what we want. But when they click on
	the browser's <b>Back</b>, they'll move
	to the non-JavaScript page, and the script there will send them
	forward again!  In effect, this technique breaks the <b>Back</b> button. With Navigator 3.0, the
	workaround is to use the <tt class=literal>replace()</tt> method of
	the Location object rather than assigning directly to the
	<tt class=literal>location</tt> property. So you should replace the
	code above with this:
	

<div class=programlisting>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT&gt;                        &lt;!-- hide script
  var path = location.path;
  var filename = "js/" + path.substring(path.lastIndexOf("/")+1, path.length);
  if (location.replace) location.replace(filename)
  else location = filename;     // stop hiding --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE>
</DIV>
