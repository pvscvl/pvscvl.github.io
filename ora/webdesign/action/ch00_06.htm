<h2 class="sect1">0.6. Acknowledgments</h2>


<p>I am honored to know, privileged to work with, and deeply indebted to
the following people:</p>


<ul><li><p>The tremendously talented Flash team at Macromedia, who through
constant innovation have shaped a medium, and who recognize the
people behind the terminals that constitute the Web.
Macromedia's combination of professionalism, exploration, and
personal passion is rare within the construct of a corporation.</p></li><li><p>The consummate professionals at O'Reilly: Tim O'Reilly,
Troy Mott, Mike Sierra, Rob Romano, Edie Freedman, and the many
copyeditors, indexers, proofreaders, and sales and marketing folks
who helped bring this book to the shelves.</p></li><li><p>Derek Clayton, my personal programming mentor and friend. In addition
to providing almost-daily code advice, Derek contributed the Perl
code in <a href="ch17_01.htm">Chapter 17, "Flash Forms"</a>, and schooled me in Quake far
too many times. He also wrote an <em class="filename">XMLSocket</em>
server in Java and a generic flat file database system in Perl, both
available from the online Code Depot.</p></li><li><p>Wendy Schaffer<em class="emphasis">, </em>who, in addition to proofreading
the first draft of the manuscript, bore the task of supporting me
with love and life during the all-consuming task of writing this
book.</p></li><li><p>Bruce Epstein<em class="emphasis">, </em>who served as the developmental
editor, helping to refine nearly every sentence in the manuscript,
often contributing content to round out topics. Bruce's
insightful editorial work and guidance were invaluable.</p></li><li><p>Gary Grossman, the creator of ActionScript at Macromedia, who somehow
always found time to answer questions, explain subtleties, and even
entertain debates during ActionScript's development. Gary acted
as lead technical editor for the book, helping to clarify important
concepts and details. Much of the accuracy of this text is the direct
result of his participation.</p></li><li><p>Slavik Lozben, Macromedia Flash Engineer, whom I cannot thank enough
for creating movie clip events and <em class="filename">swapDepths</em>!
Without Slavik's intelligence and willingness to engage in
discourse, I'd still be writing the chapter on events and event
handlers. Slavik also contributed greatly as a technical editor.</p></li><li><p>Erica Norton, Macromedia ActionScript QA
Engineer, who answered and researched question after question with
alacrity. In addition to entertaining regular discussions, Erica took
time out of her demanding schedule to be a technical editor.</p></li><li><p>Jeremy Clark, Macromedia's Flash Product Manager, who
enthusiastically supported the book with ideas, advice, friendship,
and answers to my endless stream of questions. Eric Wittman,
Macromedia's Director of Flash Product Management, whose
sagacious direction has shaped Flash for years. Janice Pearce, of
Macromedia's Flash QA team, who clarified various Flash
production issues and graciously supplied early builds of Flash 5.
Matt Wobensmith, Macromedia's Flash Community Manager, and a
regular and valuable source of knowledge. Troy Evans,
Macromedia's Flash Player Product Manager, who guides and
champions the Flash Player. Bentley Wolfe, from Macromedia's
technical support team, who seems to never leave his keyboard.</p></li><li><p>Richard Koman of O'Reilly &amp; Associates, who provided
editorial guidance during the proposal and early draft stages.</p></li><li><p>David Fugate, my literary agent from Waterside Productions, whose
diligence and confidence made business affairs practically invisible.</p></li><li><p>D. Joe Duong, who knows too much for his age, in a kind of defiance
of the amount of time he spends teaching others. I am lucky enough to
be one of those others. Mike Linkovich, the code philosopher, who is
as inspiring as he is edifying. James Porter and Andrew Murphy for
reading and testing, and reading and testing, and reading and
testing. And, of course, Graham Barton, the deserter.</p></li><li><p>Doug Keeley, Terry Maguire, and Jon Nicholls, who created ICE, a
company where occupation and passion are allowed to coexist.</p></li><li><p>Professor Paul Beam, who saw the connection between literature,
communication, and computers in the unlikely setting of an English
graduate program at the University of Waterloo.</p></li><li><p>Professor Jack Gray, for his wisdom and friendship.</p></li><li><p>Andrew Harris, David Luxton, Michael Kavanagh, Stephen Burke, Cheryl
Gula, Christine Nishino, Stephen Mumby, Karin Trgovac, and Judith
Zissman, whom I hold in esteem for their art, ideas, and friendship.</p></li><li><p>The Flash community, from whom I draw inspiration and understanding,
including James Patterson, Yugo Nakamura, Naoki Mitsuse, Joshua
Davis, James Baker, Marcell Mars, Phillip Torrone, Robert Reinhardt,
Mark Fennell, Branden Hall, Josh Ulm, Darrel Plant, Todd Purgason,
John Nack, Jason Krogh, Hillman Curtis, Glenn Thomas, and whomever
I've inevitably omitted.</p></li><li><p>The Moocks (Margaret, Michael, Jane, and Biz) for teaching me to
think, dream, explore, and love.</p></li><li><p>The Schaffers, for years of family and friendship.</p></li></ul>
<p>And lastly I'd like to thank you the reader for taking the time
to read this book. I hope it helps to make my passion your own.</p>
