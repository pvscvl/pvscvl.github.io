<h2 class="sect1">6.2. Understanding How Users Search</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-392" />Assuming you've decided to
implement a searching system for your web site, it's important
to understand how users really search before designing it.
We'll try to condense decades of research and experience
generated by the field of information retrieval into the next few
paragraphs. But it really boils down to this point: searching systems
can and should vary as much as browsing systems or any other
components of web sites do, because all users aren't alike, and
information retrieval is much harder than most people realize.</p>


<a name="ch06-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.2.1. Users Have Different Kinds of Information Needs</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-393" /> <a name="INDEX-394" />Information scientists and
librarians have been studying users' information finding habits
for decades. Until recently, these studies usually pertained to
traditional information systems, such as how to ask a library patron
the right questions to learn their information needs, or how to make
it easier to search for information in online library card catalogs
or other databases.</p>


<p>Many studies indicated that users of information systems aren't
members of a single-minded monolithic audience who want the same
kinds of information delivered in the same ways. Some want just a
little information, while others want detailed assessments of
everything there is to know about a topic. Some want only the most
accurate, highest quality information, while others don't care
much about the reliability of the source. Some will wait for the
results, while others need the information yesterday. Some are just
plain happy to get any information at all, regardless of how much
relevant stuff they're really missing. Users' needs and
expectations vary widely, and so the information systems that serve
them must recognize, distinguish, and accommodate these different
needs.</p>


<p>To illustrate, let's look at one of these factors in greater
detail: the variability in users' searching expectations.</p>


<a name="ch06-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.2.1.1. Known-item searching</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-395" />
<a name="INDEX-396" />Some users' information needs
are clearly defined and have a single, correct answer. When you check
the newspaper to see how your stock in Amalgamated Shoelace and Aglet
is doing (especially since the hostile Microsoft takeover attempt),
you know exactly what you want, that the information exists, and
where it can be found. This is the simplest type of information need.
If it were the only type, the job of the web site architect would be
much easier.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch06-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.2.1.2. Existence searching</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-397" />However,
some users know what they want but don't know how to describe
it or whether the answer exists at all. For example, you might want
to buy shares in a particular type of mutual fund that invests in
Moldovan high-tech start-ups and that carries no load. You are
convinced that this sector is up-and-coming, but do Fidelity and
Merrill Lynch know this as well? You might check their web sites,
call a broker or two, or ask your in-the-know aunt. This kind of
information need is more challenging: it might be hard to convey
exactly what you're looking for ("Moldova? What's
that?"), especially if it's a new and as-yet-unheard-of
item. Rather than a clear question for which a right answer exists,
you have an abstract idea or concept, and you don't know
whether matching information exists. The success of your search
depends as much upon the abilities of the brokers, the web sites, and
your aunt to <em class="emphasis">understand</em> your idea and its
context as whether the information (in this case, a particular mutual
fund) exists.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch06-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.2.1.3. Exploratory searching</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-398" />Some
users know how to phrase their question, but don't know exactly
what they're hoping to find, and are really just exploring and
trying to learn more. If you ever considered changing careers, you
know what we mean: you're not sure that you definitely want to
switch to a career in chinchilla farming, but you've heard
it's the place to be, so you might informally ask a friend of a
friend who has an uncle in the business. Or you call the public
library to see if there's a book on the subject. Or you write
to the Chinchilla Professionals' Association requesting more
information. In any case, you are not sure exactly what you'll
uncover, but you're willing to take the time to learn more.
Like existence searching, you have not so much a question seeking an
answer as much as an idea that you want to learn more about. Unlike
the next type of searching, you don't need to know everything
there is; a few pieces of good information will do fine for now.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch06-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.2.1.4. Comprehensive searching (research)</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-399" /> <a name="INDEX-400" />Some users want everything available
on a given topic. Scientific researchers, patent lawyers, doctoral
students trying to find unique and original dissertation topics, and
fans of any sort fit into this category. For example, if you idolize
that late great music duo Milli Vanilli, you'll want to see
everything that has anything to do with them -- singles and
records, bootlegs, concert tour posters, music videos, reviews, fan
club information, paraphernalia, interviews, books, scholarly
articles, and record-burning schedules. Even casual mentions of the
band, such as someone's incoherent ramblings in a web page or
Usenet newsgroup, are fair game if you're seeking all there is
to know about Milli Vanilli. So you might turn to all sorts of
information sources for help: friends, the library, bookstores, music
stores, radio call-in shows, Ouija boards, and so on.</p>


<p>There are many other ways of classifying information needs, but the
important thing to remember is that not all users are looking for the
same thing. Ideally, you should anticipate the most common types of
needs that your site's users will have and ensure that these
needs are met. Minimally, you should give some thought to the
variations and try to design a search interface that is flexible in
responding to them.<a name="INDEX-401" /> <a name="INDEX-402" /></p>

<h3 class="sect2">6.2.2. Searching and Browsing Are Integrated</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-403" /> <a name="INDEX-404" />One drawback to the literature on
information finding is that much of it deals with testing and
improving a single information system (e.g., an online card catalog).
But the truth is that most people, especially those with more
involved information needs, use many information systems for a
particular search. This often means jumping from Infoseek to Magellan
to a specific site to Hotbot and so on, all in the context of one
search. Even when using a single web site, users often alternate
between browsing and searching. For example, when you use Yahoo!, you
might first perform a search, find a useful site, and then, using its
Yahoo! category, browse for similarly indexed sites.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch06-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.2.3. Multiple Iterations Are Commonplace</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-405" />
<a name="INDEX-406" /> <a name="INDEX-407" />Additionally, information searching
generally doesn't take place within one clean pass, unless
it's of the <em class="emphasis">known-item searching</em> variety.
Information searching and browsing are by nature <em class="emphasis">iterat ive
</em>: users will make a first attempt at finding information,
learn something, refine their query, try finding some more, learn
some more, refine again. This is commonly known as
<em class="emphasis">associative
learning</em>
<a name="INDEX-408" />. Unfortunately, finding everything you
need at once doesn't happen all that often, because you
don't generally know enough about the topic to articulate your
query the right way in the first place.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch06-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.2.4. The Moving Target: A Likely Scenario</h3>


<p>A typical example of a search for information might go something like
this:</p>



<p>Jan, a budding entrepreneur, wants to get business cards printed for
her new company. She calls her pal Fred to see how he did it and what
company he used. Unfortunately, Fred is not in, and, never one to
dawdle, Jan leaves Fred voice mail and moves on to the yellow pages.
She finds nothing under Business Cards, but does see a number of
companies listed under Printers, and gets a few price quotes, which
all seem to be in the same neighborhood. Not sure which to select,
Jan contacts the local chapter of the Better Business Bureau for
their recommendation. The BBB folks refer Jan to their web site,
where she can search a database of companies with dubious histories.
This provides Jan with useful information that helps whittle down her
list of candidate printers. Meanwhile, Fred calls Jan back and tells
her that she really shouldn't have just business cards printed,
but that she should hire a graphic designer to create a full graphic
identity package for Jan's new business, including letterhead,
brochures, and so on. So, Jan realizes that she needs to find an
affordable, reputable graphic design firm, and she returns to the
yellow pages. She also goes to the library to do a catalog search to
see if any books describe what it's like to work with a graphic
design firm, and how much she ought to expect to pay. And so on...</p>



<p>As you can see, Jan's initially simple information need becomes
a fully fledged associative learning process, changing at least twice
(from a hunt for a printer to a hunt for a graphic design firm to
information on negotiating and working with a graphic designer), and
for all we know, it's not over yet. It also involves
<em class="emphasis">multiple information sources</em> (Fred, the yellow
pages, the library catalog, the bookstore), and utilizes
<em class="emphasis">browsing</em> (the yellow pages directory),
<em class="emphasis">searching</em> (the Web database, the library
catalog), and even <em class="emphasis">asking</em> (Fred, the Better
Business Bureau). Things aren't always as simple as they seem!
Your challenge, of course, is to design your site's
architecture to support the most common searching and browsing
approaches in a smooth and integrated way.<a name="INDEX-409" /></p>
