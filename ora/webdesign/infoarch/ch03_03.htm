<h2 class="sect1">3.3. Creating Cohesive Organization Systems</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-181" />As you've seen in this chapter,
organization systems are fairly complex. You need to consider a
variety of exact and ambiguous organization schemes. Should you
organize by topic, by task, or by audience? How about a chronological
or geographical scheme? What about using multiple organization
schemes?</p>


<p>You also need to think about the organization structures that
influence how users can navigate through these schemes. Should you
use a hierarchy or would a more structured database-model work best?
Perhaps a loose hypertextual web would allow the most flexibility?
Taken together, in the context of a large web site development
project, these questions can be overwhelming. That's why
it's important to break down the site into its components, so
you can tackle one question at a time. Also, keep in mind that all
information retrieval systems work best when applied to narrow
domains of homogeneous content. By decomposing the content collection
into these narrow domains, you can identify opportunities for highly
effective organization systems.</p>


<p>However, it's also important not to lose sight of the big
picture. As with cooking, you need to mix the right ingredients in
the right way to get the desired results. Just because you like
mushrooms and pancakes doesn't mean they will go well together.
The recipe for cohesive organization systems varies from site to
site. However, there are a few guidelines to keep in mind.</p>


<p>In considering which organization schemes to use, remember the
distinction between exact and ambiguous schemes. Exact schemes are
best for known-item searching, when users know precisely what they
are looking for. Ambiguous schemes are best for browsing and
associative learning, when users have a vaguely defined information
need. Whenever possible, use both types of schemes. Also, be aware of
the challenges of organizing information on the Web. Language is
ambiguous, content is heterogeneous, people have different
perspectives, and politics can rear its ugly head. Providing multiple
ways to access the same information can help to deal with all of
these challenges.</p>


<p>When thinking about which organization structures to use, keep in
mind that large web sites and intranets typically require all three
types of structure. The top-level, umbrella architecture for the site
will almost certainly be hierarchical. As you are designing this
hierarchy, keep a lookout for collections of structured, homogeneous
information. These potential subsites are excellent candidates for
the database model. Finally, remember that less structured, creative
relationships between content items can be handled through hypertext.
In this way, all three organization structures together can create a
cohesive organization system.<a name="INDEX-182" /></p>
