<p>What is it about buildings that stir us? Regardless of whether we
consider ourselves architectural connoisseurs or just plain folks, we
all encounter different physical structures every day. Each building
affects us emotionally, whether we realize it or not.</p>


<p>Just this evening, I spent time in a dark, smoky bar with original
tin ceilings and exposed brick walls. The bar has been around
forever, as have some of the patrons, but I chose to spend time
sipping beer there rather than in the neighboring gleaming
microbrewery that opened last year. The new place has a wider menu of
beers, better food, and non-smoking sections, but tonight I preferred
the old joint with the great graffiti on the bathroom walls.</p>


<p>After the bar, I went to a caf&eacute; to read. Ann Arbor has about
25 caf&eacute;s, 10 of which are within walking distance of each
other, and they're all decent places. So why did I go to this
one? It has a great nook with soft chairs and a low ceiling,
providing an almost totally enclosed space where I can have the
privacy I want.</p>


<p>And now I'm back at the office. Our space is located in an old
building that originally was a mechanic's garage. What was once
the oil pit is now a sunken-level workspace for graphic designers.
Exposed timber beams lift the roof high over an eclectic space
conducive to creativity. After the garage closed, the building was a
greasy spoon; my office is where the kitchen used to be. Repurposed
every decade or so, our building has worn many hats over time and
overflows with history. Back in 1918, the builder could never have
conceived that it eventually would be occupied by a Cajun restaurant
or a travel agency, much less an information architecture firm.</p>


<p>Why so much talk about the impressions that physical structures make
on us? Because they are familiar to us in ways that web sites are
not. Like web sites, buildings have architectures that cause us to
react. Buildings and their architectures therefore provide us with
great opportunities to make analogies about web sites and their
architectures.</p>


<p>Buildings and their architectures are diverse. Consider the extent of
architectural ground I covered in my brief evening jaunt. Buildings
look different -- or are architected differently -- because
they must cater to so many different uses, users, and moods.
Warehouses, strip malls, and Chinese restaurants look and work the
way they do because they are designed for varying uses. Drinking beer
with friends, reading quietly, and working all require different
environments to succeed. Web sites are the same; we visit them to
learn about alternative medicine, play games, or vent our
frustration. So each web site requires a different architecture,
designed with its particular users and uses in mind.</p>


<p>Some architectures disgust us. Ask someone who owns a house with a
flat roof how they feel about its architecture. Or someone who spends
too much time in a kitchen with no counter space right next to the
refrigerator. Or someone who works in a steel-and-glass high-rise
with fixed windows that prevent the building's occupants from
opening them and letting in fresh air.</p>


<p>Why do bad architectures happen so often? Because their architects
generally don't live or work in the buildings they design. That
hardly seems fair. The same is true of so many web sites. Why does
that main page contain over a hundred and forty links? How come the
contact information is buried so deep in the site? Why do I keep
getting lost? Don't these web sites' architects ever use
their own sites?</p>


<p>That's exactly what the next section is about. You can't
really become a proficient web site architect unless you first know
what it's like to really use the Web on a regular basis. In
other words, the best web site producer is an experienced consumer.
You must become the toughest, most critical consumer of web sites you
possibly can. Determining what you love, what you hate, and why, will
shape your own personal web design philosophy. In turn, drawing on
your new sensitivity to web consumers' needs will make a great
difference as you start designing and building your own web site.
Reaching such a level of user-centered awareness sets you aside from
every other web site developer; in a profession with such a low
barrier of entry, it may be all you have to ensure that your work
stands out.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">1.1. Consumer Sensitivity Boot Camp</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-2" />
<a name="INDEX-3" />Regardless
of your level of experience producing web sites, you should revisit
Consumer Sensitivity Boot Camp before beginning a new site or new
phase of an existing site. Why? Well, if you are an experienced site
developer, you're probably too jaded to remember what
it's like to be a new user (this has certainly happened to us).
If you're new at this, then it's likely that you're
so excited by design and technical options that you're too
distracted to worry about the user. If you work for a large
organization, its personality, jargon, and self-perspective may be so
instilled in you that you can't begin to imagine what an
outsider encounters when confronted by your corporate culture. So now
is a good time to run through our Consumer Sensitivity Boot Camp
exercise.</p>


<p>Start by assembling the people who will work on developing the site.
If this is just you, bring some other folks on board so you have a
broader set of perspectives to draw on. So pull together some
friends, coworkers, or anyone with at least a little experience using
the Web.</p>


<p>Just about everyone in the group knows from their own experiences
that using a web site has both good and bad aspects; the secret is to
unlock those sentiments by forcing the participants to articulate
them. Do this by asking your group (and yourself) to brainstorm
answers for the following two simple questions:</p>


<ul><li><p>What do you hate about the Web?</p></li><li><p>What do you like about the Web?</p></li></ul>
<p>Usually we start with the hate question, because, interestingly (and
sadly) enough, it's almost always easier for people to talk
about negatives than positives. In group settings, it's a great
way to break the ice. As the participants spew their venom (or offer
their niceties), jot each point down on a white board or flip chart.</p>


<p>Once these issues are aired, run through the positives and negatives.
Discuss any natural groupings that you notice. We almost always find
that the issues raised fall into three general areas: 1) Technical
(e.g., effective use of interactivity, bandwidth/download issues); 2)
Look and Feel (e.g., complementary aesthetics and functionality, the
importance of good copyediting); and 3) Something Else (e.g., finding
information sites, site navigation issues). Interestingly, these
Something Else issues often directly relate to information
architecture. As this is likely the first time the participants have
ever been introduced to the concept of information architecture, we
like to emphasize strongly that it really does exist and does merit
the same consideration as more obvious, tangible areas such as
graphic and technical design.</p>


<p>While the group categorizes these issues, some interesting paradoxes
often emerge. For example, a common like about web sites is their
compelling use of images. Yet a common dislike is gratuitous use of
images, many of which take a long time to download without providing
useful information or adding any benefit. As such paradoxes emerge,
light bulbs ought to appear over the heads of everyone in the group
(at least those who thought that building a web site would be easy).
It should now be obvious that building a web site and doing it well
are two hugely different tasks. If not, be concerned; your colleagues
may not be up to the arduous site design and production process that
awaits them.</p>


<p>The final step is to see if the members of your group reach consensus
on these issues. If you'll be working together on developing
the site, it's important that the team comes to a consensus
regarding what works and what doesn't. If there are
disagreements on certain issues, it's important to acknowledge
those and explore why they exist. We often find that these
disagreements are directly tied to disciplinary backgrounds. Pointing
them out now is a good way to sensitize the participants to something
that ought to be, but unfortunately isn't, always obvious:
different points of view are represented among both consumers and
producers of web content. There isn't necessarily a Right Way
or Wrong Way of going about things, but discussing these issues in
advance gets them on the table, and gets you that much closer to
making a sound and defensible decision once you are ready to begin
developing your site.</p>


<p>Of course, you and your colleagues will ideally carry over into the
development process your bittersweet memories of what it's like
to actually use web sites, resulting in a more user-centered
product.<a name="INDEX-4" />
