<h2 class="sect1">8.2. Metaphor Exploration</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-593" />
<a name="INDEX-594" />
<a name="INDEX-595" /> <a name="INDEX-596" />Metaphor can be a powerful tool for
communicating complex ideas and generating enthusiasm. By suggesting
creative relationships or by mapping the familiar onto the new,
metaphor can be used to explain, excite, and persuade. In 1992,
vice-presidential candidate Al Gore popularized the term
<em class="emphasis">information superhighway</em>. This term mapped the
familiar and respected metaphor of the physical highway
infrastructure of the United States onto the new and unfamiliar
concept of a national information infrastructure. Gore used this term
to excite the voters about his vision for the future. While the term
did oversimplify and has since been horribly overused, it succeeded
in helping people to begin learning about and discussing the
importance and direction of the global Internet.</p>


<p>Three types of metaphor can be applied in the design of web sites.
These are organizational, functional, and visual metaphors:</p>


<ul><li><p><em class="emphasis">Organizational metaphors</em> leverage familiarity
with one system's organization to convey quick understanding of
a new system's organization. For example, when you visit an
automobile dealership, you must choose to enter one of the following
departments: new car sales, used car sales, repair and service, or
parts and supplies. People have a mental model of how dealerships are
organized. If you're creating a web site for an automobile
dealership, it may make sense to employ an organizational metaphor
that draws from this model.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Functional metaphors</em> make a connection between
the tasks you can perform in a traditional environment and those you
can perform in a new environment. For example, when you enter a
traditional library, you can browse the shelves, search the catalog,
or ask a librarian for help. Many library web sites present these
tasks as options for users, thereby employing a functional metaphor.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Visual metaphors</em> leverage familiar graphic
elements such as images, icons, and colors to create a connection to
the new. For example, an online directory of business addresses and
phone numbers might use a yellow background and telephone icons to
invoke a connection with the more familiar print-based yellow pages.</p></li></ul>
<p>The process of metaphor exploration can get the creative juices
flowing. Working with your clients or colleagues, begin to brainstorm
ideas for metaphors that might apply to your project. Think about how
those metaphors might apply in organizational, functional, and visual
ways. How would you organize a virtual bookstore or library or
museum? Is your site more like a bookstore or a library or a museum?
What are the differences? What tasks should users be able to perform?
What should it look like? You and your colleagues should cut loose
and have fun with this exercise. You'll be surprised by the
ideas you come up with.</p>


<p>After this brainstorming session, you'll want to subject
everyone's brilliant ideas to a more critical review. Start
populating the rough metaphor-based architecture with random items
from the expected content to see if they fit. Try one or two user
scenarios to see if the metaphor holds up. While metaphor exploration
is a useful process, you should not feel obligated to carry all or
any of the ideas forward into the information architecture. The
reality is that metaphors are great for getting ideas flowing during
the conceptual design process, but can be problematic when carried
forward into the site itself.</p>


<p>For example, the metaphor of a virtual community has been taken too
far in many cases. Some of these online communities have post
offices, town halls, shopping centers, libraries, schools, and police
stations. Figuring out what types of activities take place in which
"buildings" can be a real challenge for the user. In such
cases, the metaphor hampers usability. As an architect, you should
ensure that any use of metaphor is empowering and not limiting (see
<a href="ch08_02.htm">Figure 8-2</a>).</p>

The Internet Public Library uses visual and organizational metaphors to provide access to the reference area. Users can browse the shelves or ask a question. However, the traditional library metaphor did not support integration of a multi-user, object-oriented environment, or MOO. Applied in such a strong way, metaphors can quickly become limiting factors in site architecture and design.</h4>

<p>You should also go into this exercise understanding that people tend
to fall in love with their own metaphors. Make sure everyone knows
that this is just an exercise and that it rarely makes sense to carry
the metaphor into the information architecture design.<a name="INDEX-597" /> <a name="INDEX-598" /> <a name="INDEX-599" /> <a name="INDEX-600" /></p>
