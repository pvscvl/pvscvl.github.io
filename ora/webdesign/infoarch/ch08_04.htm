<a name="INDEX-616" />The<a name="INDEX-617" />
<a name="INDEX-618" /> collaborative brainstorming process
is exciting, chaotic, and fun. However, sooner or later, you must
hole up away from the crowd and transform this chaos into order.
Blueprints are the architect's tool of choice for performing
this transformation.</p>


<p>The very act of shaping ideas into the more formal structure of a
blueprint forces you to become realistic and practical. If
brainstorming takes you to the top of the mountain, blueprinting
brings you back down to reality. Ideas that seemed brilliant on the
white board may not pan out when you attempt to organize them in a
practical manner. It's easy to throw around concepts such as
<em class="emphasis">audience-specific gateways</em> and
<em class="emphasis">adaptive information architectures</em>. It's
not so easy to define on paper exactly how these concepts will be
applied to a specific web site.</p>


<p>During the conceptual design phase, high-level blueprints are most
useful for exploring primary organization schemes and approaches.
High-level blueprints map out the organization and labeling of major
areas, usually beginning with a bird's-eye view from the main
page of the web site. This exploration may involve several iterations
as you further define the information architecture. High-level
blueprints are great for stimulating discussions focused on the
organization and management of content as well as the desired access
pathways for users. These blueprints can be created by hand, but we
prefer to use diagramming software such as Visio or NetObjects
Fusion. These products not only help you to quickly layout your
architecture blueprints, but can also help with site production and
maintenance.</p>


<a name="ch08-31970" /><div class="figure"><img height="621" alt="Figure 8-3" src="figs/info_0803.gif" width="503" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-3. This high-level blueprint shows pages, components within pages, groups of pages, and relationships between pages. The grouping of pages can inform page layout. For example, the three value-added guides should be presented together, whereas Search &amp; Browse, Feedback, and News should be presented separately. </h4>

<p>Let's walk through the blueprint in <a href="ch08_04.htm">Figure 8-3</a>, as we would when presenting it to clients or
colleagues. The building block of this architecture is the sub-site.
Within this company, the ownership and management of content is
distributed among many individuals in different departments. There
are already dozens of small and large web sites, each with its own
graphic identity and information architecture. Rather than try to
enforce one standard across this collection of sites, this blueprint
suggests an umbrella architecture approach that allows for the
existence of lots of heterogeneous sub-sites.</p>


<p>Moving up from the sub-sites, we see a directory of sub-site records.
This directory serves as a card catalog that provides easy access to
the sub-sites. There is a sub-site record for each sub-site. Each
record consists of fields such as <em class="emphasis">title</em>,
<em class="emphasis">description</em>, <em class="emphasis">keywords</em>,
<em class="emphasis">audience</em>, <em class="emphasis">format</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">topic</em> that describe the contents of that
sub-site.</p>


<p>By creating a standardized record for each sub-site, we are actually
creating a database of sub-site records. This database approach
enables powerful known-item searching and more exploratory browsing.
As you can see from the Search &amp; Browse page, users can search
and browse by title, audience, format, and topic.</p>


<p>We also see three value-added guides. These guides take the form of
simple narratives or stories that introduce new users to the
organization and to the web site. Interwoven throughout the text of
these narratives are in-context links to selected sub-sites. They
guide users through the site in an interesting and friendly way.</p>


<p>Finally, we see a dynamic news billboard (perhaps implemented through
Java or JavaScript) that rotates the display of featured news
headlines and announcements. In addition to bringing some action to
the main page, this billboard provides yet another way to access
important content that might otherwise be buried within a sub-site.</p>


<p>At this point in the discussion of the high-level blueprint, you are
sure to have questions. As you can see, the blueprints don't
completely speak for themselves. This is why it's ideal to
present these blueprints in person, so you can answer questions and
explore new ideas.</p>


<p>In addition, your architectural ideas may need selling. Now,
we're not suggesting that you buy a polyester suit, but an
element of sales is involved. You need to excite your clients and
colleagues about your approach and vision for the site. You need to
explain the ideas behind your labeling and organization schemes and
describe how this model will support growth over time. These
challenges are difficult to address without a meeting (or at least a
telephone conference call).</p>


<p>However, if a meeting is simply not possible, you can accompany
blueprints with descriptive text-based documents that anticipate and
answer the most likely questions. You can then follow up with a
conference call to answer the questions you didn't anticipate
and move the process along.</p>


<p>You should note that these high-level blueprints leave out quite a
bit of information. They focus on the major
<em class="emphasis">areas</em> of the site, ignoring navigation elements
and page-level details. These omissions are by design, not by
accident. Shaping the information architecture of a complex web site
is a challenging intellectual exercise. You and your colleagues must
be able to focus on the big picture issues at hand. For these
blueprints, as with the web sites you design, remember the rule of
thumb that <em class="emphasis">less is more</em>. Detailed page-level
blueprints come later in the <a name="INDEX-619" /> <a name="INDEX-620" /> <a name="INDEX-621" /> <a name="INDEX-622" /> <a name="INDEX-623" />process.<a name="INDEX-624" /> <a name="INDEX-625" /></p>
