<h2 class="sect1">9.6. Learning from Users</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-716" /> <a name="INDEX-717" /> <a name="INDEX-718" /> <a name="INDEX-719" /> <a name="INDEX-720" />Unfortunately,
many <a name="INDEX-721" />sites fall victim to the launch
`em and leave `em attitude of site owners, who turn their
attention to more urgent or interesting projects, allowing the
content or the architecture to become obsolete quickly. Even for
those sites kept current with respect to content, the information
architectures are rarely refined and extended.</p>


<p>This is too bad, because it is after the launch of a web site that
you have the best opportunity to learn about what does and
doesn't work. If you are fortunate enough to be given the time,
budget, and mandate to learn from users and improve your web site, a
number of tools and techniques can help you do so.</p>


<p>As you read this section, please understand that high-quality testing
of site architectures requires experts in usability engineering. For
pointers to expert coverage of tools and techniques specific to
usability engineering, please review the usability area of our
bibliography.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">9.6.1. Focus Groups </h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-722" />Focus groups
are one of the most common and most abused tools for learning from
users. When conducting focus groups, you gather together groups of
people who are actual or potential users of your site. In a typical
focus group session, you may ask a series of scripted questions about
what users would like to see on the site, demonstrate a prototype or
show the site itself, ask questions about the users' perception
of the site, and get their recommendations for improvement.</p>


<p>Focus groups are great for generating ideas about possible content
and function for the site. By getting several people from your target
audiences together and facilitating a brainstorming session, you can
quickly find yourself with a laundry list of suggestions.</p>


<p>However, focus groups are very poor vehicles for testing the
usability of a site. A public demonstration does not come close to
replicating the actual environment of a user navigating a web site.
Consequently, the suggestions of people in focus groups do not
necessarily carry much weight. Sadly, focus groups are often used to
prove that a particular approach does or doesn't work. Through
the skillful selection and phrasing of questions, focus groups can
easily be influenced in one direction or another. To learn more about
when and how to conduct focus groups, see the usability section of
our bibliography.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">9.6.2. Individual User Testing</h3>


<p>A much more appropriate way to study the usability of a prototype or
post-launch web site is to conduct individual user testing. This
method involves bringing in some real users, giving them some typical
test tasks, and asking them to think out loud while they perform the
tasks. The statements and actions of the user can be recorded several
ways, ranging from the high-tech videotape and usage tracking
approach to the low-tech notes-on-paper approach. Either way,
it's important to try this exercise with several different
users, ideally from different audience groups. As Jakob Nielsen
suggests in "Guerrilla HCI"
(<a href="../../../../../../www.useit.com/papers/guerilla_hci.html&#10%3B">http://www.useit.com/papers/guerilla_hci.html
</a>), you can learn a great deal about what does and
doesn't work very quickly and inexpensively using this
approach.</p>

<a name="ch09-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.6.3. Questions and Suggestions</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-723" /> <a name="INDEX-724" />One of the simplest ways to collect
information about the usability of your site is to ask users to tell
you what does and doesn't work. Build a Questions and
Suggestions area in your site, and make it available from every page
in the site.</p>


<p>In addition, you should adopt a No Dead-Ends policy, always giving
the user a way to move towards the information they need. One
technique involves using the following context-sensitive suggestion
at the bottom of a search results page.:</p>



<p>Not finding what you're looking for with search? Try <u class="emphasis-underline">browsing</u> our web site or <u class="emphasis-underline">tell
us</u> what you're looking for and we'll try to help.</p>



<p>Whether employing a generic or context-sensitive approach, make it
easy for users to provide feedback. Instead of using a
<em class="emphasis">mailto:</em> tag that requires proper browser
customization, use a form-based approach that integrates online
documentation with the opportunity to interact. In this way, you
might answer the user's question faster and avoid spending
staff time on producing the answer.</p>


<p>Avoid the temptation of creating a feedback form that is long, since
most users will never fill it out. Ask only the most important and
necessary questions. If your site is blessed with an active audience
willing to provide feedback, wonderful. If not, you might combine an
online survey with a contest involving free gifts.</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-725" />
<a name="INDEX-726" />Finally, if you're going to make it
easy for users to ask questions and make suggestions, you also need
to establish procedures that allow you to respond quickly and
effectively.</p>


<p>It's important to respond to users who take the time to provide
feedback. This is common courtesy. It also makes sense since a user
may be a customer or investor, or perhaps a senior executive in
virtual disguise.</p>


<p>To facilitate prompt responses and promote efficiency at the
back-end, build triage into your site's feedback system.
Provide users with the option to contact the webmaster for technical
problems and the content specialist for questions about the
site's content.</p>


<p>You'll also need to create a system for reviewing and acting
upon questions and suggestions. In a large organization, you may need
to form a site review and design committee to meet once per month,
review the questions and suggestions, and identify opportunities for
improvement.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">9.6.4. Usage Tracking </h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-727" /> <a name="INDEX-728" /> <a name="INDEX-729" /> <a name="INDEX-730" /> <a name="INDEX-731" /> <a name="INDEX-732" />Basic usage logs and statistics
reports are of little value. They do tell you roughly how many times
your site is visited and which pages are viewed. However, this
information does not tell you how to improve your site.</p>


<p>If you want more useful information, you can use more complex
approaches to tracking users. The most complex approach involves the
tracking of user's paths as they search and browse a web site.
You can trace where a user comes from (originating site) to reach
your site; the path they take through your organization, navigation,
and searching systems; and where they go next (destination site).
Along the way, you can learn how long they spend on each page. This
creates a tremendously rich data stream, which can be fascinating to
review, but difficult to act upon. What you need to make this
information valuable is feedback from users explaining why they came
to the site, what they found, and why they left. If you combine
technology that pops up a questionnaire when users are about to leave
the site with an incentive for completing your questionnaire, you
might be able to capture this information. Just be careful not to
irritate the users with this kind of approach. It may be something
you do for a short period of time in conjunction with a special
promotion.</p>


<p>A simpler approach involves the tracking and analysis of queries
entered into the
<a name="INDEX-733" /> <a name="INDEX-734" /> <a name="INDEX-735" />search engine, like
that shown in <a href="ch09_06.htm">Figure 9-7</a>. By studying these
queries, you can identify what users are looking for and the words
and phrases they use. You can isolate the queries that retrieve zero
results. Are users employing different labels or looking for
information that doesn't exist on your site? Are they failing
to use Boolean operators the way you intended? Based upon the
answers, you can take immediate and concrete steps to fix the
problems. You may change labels, improve search tips, or even add
content to the site.</p>


<a name="ch09-29898" /><div class="figure"><img height="309" alt="Figure 9-7" src="figs/info_0907.gif" width="474" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-7. This query analysis tool allows you to filter by date and IP address. You can also isolate queries that resulted in zero hits. By leveraging the IP address and date/time information, the software enables you to see an individual user's progress (or lack thereof) as he or she tries one search after another.</h4>

<p>In considering these approaches, it's important to realize that
the data is useful only if you and your organization are committed to
acting upon what you learn. Gigabytes upon gigabytes of usage
statistics are ignored every day by well-meaning but very busy site
architects and designers who fail to close the feedback loop.</p>


<p>However, if you can commit to continuous user-centric improvement,
your site will soon reach a level of quality and usability beyond
what could have ever been achieved through good architectural design
alone. And it will only get better, as it is subjected to the
constant evolutionary pressures of time, competition, and
increasingly demanding users.</p>


<p>Similarly, if you maintain that personal feedback loop between your
experiences as a consumer and your sensibilities as a producer, your
information architectures will continue to improve over <a name="INDEX-736" /> <a name="INDEX-737" /> <a name="INDEX-738" /> <a name="INDEX-739" /> <a name="INDEX-740" /> <a name="INDEX-741" />time. <a name="INDEX-742" /> <a name="INDEX-743" /> <a name="INDEX-744" /> <a name="INDEX-745" /> <a name="INDEX-746" /> <a name="INDEX-747" /></p>
