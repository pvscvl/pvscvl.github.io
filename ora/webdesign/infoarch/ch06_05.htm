<h2 class="sect1">6.5. Indexing the Right Stuff</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-457" /> <a name="INDEX-458" /> <a name="INDEX-459" />So,
let's get back to whether you need a search engine. Let's
assume that you do intend to slap a search engine on top of your web
site. Shouldn't be a problem right? Just point the indexer at
the directory where all the pages live, and, voil&agrave;! Searchable
site!</p>


<p>Of course, you knew it wasn't that simple. Searching only works
well when the stuff that's being searched is the same as the
stuff that users want. This means you may not want to index the
entire site. We'll explain.</p>


<a name="ch06-23-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.1. Indexing the Entire Site</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-460" />
<a name="INDEX-461" />Search engines are frequently used to
index an entire site without regard for the content and how it might
vary -- every word of every page, whether it contains real content
or help information, advertising, navigation menus, and so on.</p>


<p>However, searching works much better when the information space is
defined narrowly and contains homogeneous content. In other words,
the more you search through indices that combine <em class="emphasis">apples and
oranges</em>, the worse your retrieval results will be. After
all, when you search a site, you're probably looking for
<em class="emphasis">apples</em> only, not <em class="emphasis">oranges</em>.
As already discussed, a site's content is usually a mix of
apples, oranges, kumquats, bell peppers, chainsaws, and Barbie dolls
to begin with. So, when you tell your search engine to index your
entire site, the site's users will be performing searches
against all kinds of stuff -- navigation, destination, and other
kinds of pages -- all at once. What they retrieve can often be
ugly.</p>


<p>Let's try an example to see what happens. Searching
Netscape's site for <em class="emphasis">plug-ins</em>, what do we
find? Exactly 100 documents.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-16">[16]</a> Of these:</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-16" /><p>[16] Search done on February
2, 1997.</p>

</blockquote>


<ul><li><p>58 documents are Welcome to Netscape Navigator version X.X pages for
just about every version of Netscape Navigator and include
information about plug-ins.</p></li><li><p>16 documents are in German (a language I don't read).</p></li><li><p>6 documents contain the potentially relevant term
<em class="emphasis">application</em> in their titles, but 5 of these 6
have exactly the same title (<em class="emphasis">Netscape Handbook: Application
Features</em>).</p></li><li><p>2 documents actually contain <em class="emphasis">plug-in</em> in their
titles.</p></li><li><p>18 other assorted documents may be relevant, but are not labeled in a
way that indicates whether this is the case.</p></li></ul>
<p>Analyzing these search results, we find two common problems. First,
we are presented with documents that clearly don't belong. If
the site had been selectively indexed with audience differences in
mind, 16% of the results would not have been displayed at all.
Second, regarding relevant documents, it's not clear why we
need 58 versions of the same type of document. It would have been
useful to index pages more selectively, such as files relevant to
Windows or Macintosh users, or recent versions versus older versions
of the software. Are very many people still interested in old
Netscape Beta versions? So, our search is less successful than it
could have been; it gave us a lot of irrelevant documents, and too
many that <em class="emphasis">could</em> be relevant.</p>


<p>Our search performed poorly because all the content in the site was
indexed together. By doing so, the site's architects chose to
ignore two very important things: that the information in their site
isn't all the same, and that it makes good sense to respect the
lines already drawn between different types of content. For example,
it's clear that German and English content are vastly different
and that their audiences overlap very little (if at all), so why not
create separately searchable indices along those divisions?</p>


<p>The site designers at Netscape are already doing this, in a limited
way. They have put a lot of effort into helping you download the
right version of the software from the nearest location. To download
the software, you get asked several questions (not unlike those in a
reference interview). Shown in <a href="ch06_05.htm">Figure 6-15</a>, the site
asks the user:</p>


<ul><li><p>What operating system does your computer use?</p></li><li><p>What language do you speak?</p></li><li><p>Which of our products do you need?</p></li></ul>
<a name="ch06-31881" /><div class="figure"><img height="407" alt="Figure 6-15" src="figs/info_0615.gif" width="464" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-15. Three pull-down menus perform a brief reference interview sufficient to help users download the appropriate software product.</h4>
<p>The result is a list of links to download sites that provide the user
the right information (i.e., software appropriate to the user's
platform), taking into account his or her geographic location and
language. Why not apply this same careful approach to matching users
with the right information to the entire site, instead of just to
this specific situation?<a name="INDEX-462" /> <a name="INDEX-463" /></p>
</div>




<a name="ch06-25-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.5.2. Search Zones: Selectively Indexing the Right Content</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-464" /> <a name="INDEX-465" /> <a name="INDEX-466" />
<a name="INDEX-467" />
<a name="INDEX-468" /> <a name="INDEX-469" />Search
zones are subsets of a web site that have been indexed separately
from the rest of the site's content. When you search a search
zone, you have, through interaction with the site, already identified
yourself as a member of a particular audience or as someone searching
for a particular type of information. The search zones in a site
match those specific needs, and the result is improved retrieval
performance. The user is simply less likely to retrieve irrelevant
information.</p>


<p>The Microsoft site has a good example of search zone use. Although
this site suffers from other searching problems, it compares
favorably to the Netscape site when searching for our old stand-by,
<em class="emphasis">plug-ins</em>. On the search page you're asked
where you want to search in the Microsoft site, and are provided with
the options on a pull-down menu (<a href="ch06_05.htm">Figure 6-16</a>).</p>


<a name="ch06-10582" /><div class="figure"><img height="459" alt="Figure 6-16" src="figs/info_0616.gif" width="500" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-16. Microsoft's site employs search zones to help focus the user's search before submitting a query to the search engine.</h4>

<p>You've got many options to review, but you can quickly find the
<em class="emphasis">Internet Explorer</em> area of the site where
you'd want to look for plug-ins. Consider how well the effort
the user expends in reviewing and selecting from this menu compares
to the much greater effort of searching the entire site and then
sifting through a tremendously larger retrieval set. Also note the
<em class="emphasis">Full Site Search</em> option; sometimes it does make
sense to maintain an index of the entire site, especially for users
who are unsure where to look, who are doing a comprehensive
leave-no-stones-unturned search, or who just haven't had any
luck searching the more narrowly defined indices.</p>


<p>How is search zone indexing set up? It depends on the search engine
software used. Most support the creation of search zones, but some
provide interfaces that make this process easier, while others
require you to manually provide a list of pages to index. In either
case, search zone indexing requires more work on your part than
simply pointing the search engine at the entire site: you'll
need to review and mark each page that should be indexed. To make
this easier, you might design your site so that pages that should be
indexed together are located in the same directory; that way, you
would mark for indexing a directory (and, implicitly, its contents)
instead of its individual pages. You may also be working with pages
that are generated from a database. In this case, you could design
the database to include a field for each record denoting which index
the generated page should belong to.</p>


<p>You can create search zones in many ways. Examples of four common
approaches are:</p>


<ul><li><p>by content type</p></li><li><p>by audience</p></li><li><p>by subject</p></li><li><p>by date</p></li></ul>
<p>Note that these approaches are similar to the organization schemes
discussed in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Organizing Information"</a>. The decisions you made in
selecting your site's organization scheme will often work for
determining search zones as well. You could also try other ways; the
most important consideration is to choose an approach appropriate to
your site's audiences and their information needs.</p>


<a name="ch06-26-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.5.2.1. Apples and apples: indexing similar content types</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-470" />
<a name="INDEX-471" />
<a name="INDEX-472" /> <a name="INDEX-473" />Most web sites contain, at minimum,
two major and dissimilar types of pages:
<em class="emphasis">navigation</em> and <em class="emphasis">destination.</em>
Destination pages contain the actual information you want from a web
site: sport scores, book reviews, software documentation, and so on.
The primary purpose of a site's navigation pages is to
<em class="emphasis">get you to</em> <em class="emphasis">the destination
pages</em>. Navigation pages may include main pages, search
pages, and pages that help you browse a site.</p>


<p>When a user searches a site, he or she is generally looking for
destination pages. If navigation pages are part of the retrieval,
they will just clutter up the retrieval results. In fact, the reason
that the user is searching rather than browsing some other way could
be because the navigation system is performing poorly in the first
place. So why keep showing the user navigation pages that don't
work and aren't relevant to the search?</p>


<p>Let's take a simple example: your company sells computer
products via its web site. The destination pages consist of
descriptions, pricing, and ordering information, one page for each
product. Also, a number of navigation pages help users find products,
such as listings of products for different platforms (e.g., Macintosh
versus Windows), listings of products for different applications
(e.g., word processing, bookkeeping), listings of business versus
home products, and listings of hardware versus software products. If
the user is searching for Intuit's Quicken, what's likely
to happen? Instead of simply retrieving Quicken's product page,
they might get all these pages:</p>


<blockquote class="simplelist">

<p>Financial Products Index Page</p>

<p>Home Products Index Page</p>

<p>Macintosh Products Index Page</p>

<p>Quicken Product Page</p>

<p>Software Products Index Page</p>

<p>Windows Products Index Page</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The user retrieves the right destination page (i.e., the Quicken
Product Page), but also five more that are purely navigation pages.
In other words, 83% of the retrieval is in the way. And keep in mind
that this example is simple; what if the user had to ignore 83% of a
much larger retrieval set, say, 200 documents?</p>


<p>Of course, indexing similar content isn't always easy, because
"similar" is a highly relative term. It's not
always clear where to draw the line between navigation and
destination pages. In some cases, a page can be considered both. For
example, we tried the approach described here for the SIGGRAPH 96
Conference web site.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-17">[17]</a> We found that some pages didn't really fit the
navigation/destination breakdown. For example, the Exhibition Hall
Map page appears to be navigation. It links to pages for each of the
five sections of the hall. These five pages appear to be destination,
presenting detailed maps of their respective sections, including
booth numbers and the names of exhibitors. But their parent page also
provides important information, such as where the hall entrances are,
and where the five sections are in relation to one another. So
isn't the main Exhibition Hall Map page destination as well as
navigation? The best solution, in this particular case, was to index
these hybrid pages, but it wasn't ideal.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-17" /><p>[17]This site evolved greatly during
the year leading up to SIGGRAPH 96, and then some after the
conference was complete. The fullest version of this site is archived
at<em class="emphasis">
http://siggraph.anecdote.com/conferences/siggraph96</em>.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The more important lesson from this experience was to test out the
navigation/destination distinctions before actually applying them.
The weakness of the navigation/destination approach is that it is
essentially an exact organization scheme (discussed in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Organizing Information"</a>)
which requires the pages to be either one thing (in this case
destination) or another (navigation). In the following three
approaches, the organization approaches are ambiguous, and therefore
more forgiving of pages that fit into multiple categories. <a name="INDEX-474" /> <a name="INDEX-475" /> <a name="INDEX-476" /> <a name="INDEX-477" /></p>
</div>



<a name="ch06-27-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.5.2.2. Who's going to care? Indexing for specific audiences</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-478" />
<a name="INDEX-479" />
<a name="INDEX-480" />
<a name="INDEX-481" />If
you've already decided to create an architecture for your site
that uses an audience-oriented organization scheme, it may make sense
to create search zones by audience breakdown as well. We found this a
useful approach for the original Library of Michigan web site.</p>


<p>The Library of Michigan has three primary audiences: members of the
Michigan state legislature and their staffs, Michigan libraries and
their librarians, and the citizens of Michigan. The information
needed from this site is different for each of these audiences; for
example, each has a very different circulation policy. Why would a
state legislator care how long a citizen can check a book out for?</p>


<p>So we created four indices: one for the content relevant to each
audience, and one unified index of the entire site in case the
audience-specific indices didn't do the trick for a particular
search. Here are the results from running a query on the word
<em class="emphasis">circulation</em> against each of the four indices:</p>


<a name="ch06-28-fm2xml" /><table border="1">




<tr>
<th>
<p>Index</p></th>
<th>
<p>Number of Documents Retrieved</p></th>
<th>
<p>Retrieval Reduced By</p></th>
</tr>




<tr>
<td>
<p>Unified</p></td>
<td>
<p>40</p></td>
<td>
<p>-</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Legislature Area</p></td>
<td>
<p>18</p></td>
<td>
<p>55%</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Libraries Area</p></td>
<td>
<p>24</p></td>
<td>
<p>40%</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Citizens Area</p></td>
<td>
<p>9</p></td>
<td>
<p>78%</p></td>
</tr>


</table>

<p>As with any search zone, less overlap between indices improves
performance. If the sizes of retrieval results were reduced by a very
small figure, let's say, 10% or 20%, it may not be worth the
overhead of creating separate audience-oriented indices. But in this
case, much of the site's content is specific to one of the
audiences.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-482" />
<a name="INDEX-483" /> <a name="INDEX-484" /> <a name="INDEX-485" />
<a name="INDEX-486" />If your site uses a strong
subject-oriented or topical organization scheme, you've already
distinguished many of the site's search zones. Yahoo! is
perhaps the most popular site to employ subject-oriented search
zones. Every subject category and subcategory in Yahoo! can be
searched individually. For example, let's say you're
looking for sites that deal with science fiction movies. If you
search for <em class="emphasis">science</em> <em class="emphasis">fiction</em>
against the whole Yahoo! search index, you'll retrieve a lot of
stuff: 35 category and subcategory matches and 816 site matches. But
you're not looking for science fiction in general; you're
looking for science fiction movies. So, instead you can run the same
<em class="emphasis">science fiction</em> search against the index for the
Yahoo! subcategory <em class="emphasis">Movies and Films</em>. This time
you'll be happier with your retrieval: 2 category and
subcategory matches and 19 site matches. This is another excellent
example of how hierarchical search zones allow for increased
specificity, and therefore improved retrieval results.</p>

organized content allows for perhaps the easiest implementation of
search zones. (Not surprisingly, it's probably the most common

ambiguous, indexing them by date is staightforward.</p>


<p><em class="emphasis">News.Com</em> is a great example (<a href="ch06_05.htm">Figure 6-17</a>); it supports highly flexible chronological
