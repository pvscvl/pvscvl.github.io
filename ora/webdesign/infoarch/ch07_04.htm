<h2 class="sect1">7.4. Identifying Content and Function Requirements</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-549" /> <a name="INDEX-550" /> <a name="INDEX-551" />One of the biggest challenges in
information architecture design is that of trying to get your arms
around the intended content and functionality of the web site. For a
large site, this can be absolutely daunting. The first step to
success is realizing that you can't do it all at once. The
identification of content and function requirements may involve
several iterations. So just roll up your sleeves and get started.</p>


<a name="ch07-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.4.1. Identifying Content in Existing Web Sites</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-552" />As the Web matures, more and
more projects involve rearchitecting existing web sites rather than
creating new ones from scratch. In such cases, you're granted
the opportunity to stand on the shoulders of those who came before
you. You can examine the contents of the existing web site and use
that content inventory as a place to begin.</p>


<p>Rather than pointing and clicking your way through hundreds or
thousands of web pages, you should consider using an automated site
mapping tool such as SiteMap (see <a href="ch07_04.htm">Figure 7-2</a>).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-21">[21]</a> These tools generate a text-only view
of the hierarchy of the web site. If the original architects
structured the hierarchy and labeled page titles reasonably well, you
should get a bird's-eye view of the existing architecture and a
nicely organized inventory of the site's content. At this
point, you're way ahead of the game. However, it's almost
certain that the site redesign will involve the addition of new
content and the integration of new applications, so don't think
you get to escape from the challenge of identifying content and
function requirements.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-21" /><p>[21]To use SiteMap, go to
<a href="../../../../../../www.jazzsoft.com/">http://www.jazzsoft.com</a> and enter the URL of
the site you'd like to map. If that web site is in the SiteMap
database, you'll see the map right away. Otherwise, SiteMap
will ask for your email address and send you a message when the map
is ready. Many offline browsers also offer a site mapping
capability.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">7.4.2. Wish Lists and Content Inventory Forms</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-553" /> <a name="INDEX-554" />
<a name="INDEX-555" /> <a name="INDEX-556" />Many clients come to us with completely
unrealistic timelines in mind. It is not unusual for a client to
approach us in November stating that they want a world-class web site
by the end of the year. In the early days, this would send us into a
world-class panic. "How can we possibly build this site in 6
weeks?" we'd ask ourselves. "We'll have to
work 36 hours a day each." However, we soon learned this panic
to be unnecessary. Why? Because the greatest time-sink in Web and
intranet design projects involves the identification and collection
of content, meaning that the client, not us, quickly becomes the
bottleneck.</p>


<p>Collecting content from people in multiple departments takes time and
effort. This is particularly true of large, geographically
distributed organizations. Some people and departments may care about
the project and respond quickly to requests for content. Others may
not. Content will reside in a multitude of formats ranging from
Microsoft Word to VAX/VMS databases to paper. Content may be limited
for viewing by internal authorized audiences or subject to copyright
restrictions. Since it is impossible to design an effective
information architecture without a good feel for the desired content,
you can rest easy knowing that the client's organization will
soon become the bottleneck in the research phase.</p>


<p>However, that is not to say that the architect is not responsible for
guiding this content collection process. On the contrary, your job is
to help develop a process that efficiently and effectively collects
all content and information about content that you will need to
design and build the site. Wish lists and content inventory forms are
invaluable tools for such a process.</p>


<p>Your most immediate goal is to gather enough information about the
desired content to begin discussing possible architectural
approaches. In the early stages, you do not need or even want the
content itself. What you want is an understanding of the breadth and
depth of content that might be integrated into the site over time.
You want the top of the mountain, long-term view. Remember that you
are trying to design for growth. You don't want your vision to
be limited by short-term format or availability or copyright issues.</p>


<p>Wish lists are an excellent tool for this information gathering task
(see <a href="ch07_04.htm">Figure 7-3</a>). Invite all relevant parties to
create wish lists that describe the types of content they would like
to see on the web site. Make sure you include people who deal with
others' information needs on a regular basis (e.g., technical
support staff, librarians). Ask them to take a first stab at
organizing that content into categories. Involve senior managers and
sales representatives, information systems specialists and
secretaries. If appropriate and practical, involve representatives
from the intended audiences as well. With these relatively
unstructured wish lists you can expect a fast turnaround time. Within
a week or so you can solicit, gather, and organize responses and
begin moving ahead with conceptual design. You will find that this
process helps you to define and prioritize the content for the web
site.</p>

As you can see, wish lists not only define the scope of content, but also provide you with a good start at organizing the content into categories.</h4>

<p>Once people have taken a first pass at the wish list, you can compile
the complete set of content requirements and ask the same group to
rank that content according to importance and urgency, as in the
example below. This type of structured form allows you to quickly
learn about the desired content and associated priorities.</p>


<a name="ch07-14-fm2xml" /><table border="1">




<tr>
<th>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">New Content Suggestions</b></p>


<p><em class="emphasis">Please complete the following form. For each content item,
indicate its importance by assigning a priority of 1 to 4 (1 being
most important and urgent). When appropriate, also provide a
description, indicating how much content is involved and noting any
important issues. You may use the blank rows for additional content
items to be included in the Web Site Re-Launch.</em></p></th>

<p>At this time, it is also important to begin a parallel process of
content collection, not because you need the content yet, but because
the process of collection takes a long time and can happen
independently of your architecture efforts. The efficient collection
of content in a large, distributed organization requires a highly
structured process. A content inventory form is a useful tool for
bringing structure to this process.</p>


<p>The sample content inventory form in <a href="ch07_04.htm">Figure 7-4</a>
provides an idea of the types of questions you might need to ask.
You'll want descriptive information that includes a name and
unique identification number (used to connect the content inventory
form with print and electronic versions of the actual content). A
brief content description and an indication of the intended audience
will often prove more useful at this stage than seeing the content
itself (which might really slow things down).</p>

<p>This form should be accompanied by instructions that explain how to
submit the response and by both print and electronic versions of the
content. Ideally, you will design a simple data entry form that
allows online submission of responses. You might use the Web as the
medium for distributing the form. We've also used common
database applications such as Microsoft Access.</p>


<p>In this way you can use a database as the repository of all completed
content inventory forms. This facilitates tracking progress and
content analysis. For example, you will be able to generate a report
that shows how much content is intended for a particular <a name="INDEX-557" /> <a name="INDEX-558" /> <a name="INDEX-559" /> <a name="INDEX-560" />audience.<a name="INDEX-561" /> <a name="INDEX-562" /> <a name="INDEX-563" /></p>
