<h2 class="sect1">8.3. Scenarios</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-601" /> <a name="INDEX-602" />
<a name="INDEX-603" />While
architecture blueprints are excellent tools for capturing an approach
to information organization in a detailed and structured way, they do
not tend to excite people. As an architect who wants to convince your
colleagues of the wisdom of your approach, you need to help them
envision the site as you see it in your mind's eye. Scenarios
are great tools for helping people to understand how the user will
navigate and experience the site you design. They will also help you
think through the experience your site will provide and may generate
new ideas for the architecture and navigation system.</p>


<p>To provide a multidimensional experience that shows the true
potential for the site, it is best to write a few scenarios that show
how people with different needs and behaviors would navigate your
site. Before beginning the scenario, you should think about the
primary intended audiences. Who are the people that will use your
site? Why and how will they want to use it? Will they be in a rush or
will they want to explore? Try to select three or four major user
types who will use the site in very different ways. Create a
character who represents each type. Give them a name, a profession,
and a reason for visiting your site, as demonstrated in the sidebar.
Then, begin to flesh out a sample session in which that person uses
your site. Try to highlight the best features of the site through
your scenario. If you've designed for a new customization
feature, show how someone would use it.</p>


<p>This is a great opportunity to be creative. You'll probably
find these scenarios to be easy and fun to write. Hopefully,
they'll help convince your colleagues to invest in your ideas.</p>

<h4 class="objtitle">Sample Scenario</h4>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-604" />
<a name="INDEX-605" />Rosalind, a tenth grader in San Francisco,
regularly visits the LiveFun Web site because she enjoys the
interactive learning experience. She uses the site in both
<em class="emphasis">investigative
mode</em>
<a name="INDEX-606" /> and <em class="emphasis">serendipity
mode</em>
<a name="INDEX-607" />.</p>


<p>For example, when her anatomy class was studying skeletal structure,
she used the investigative mode to search for resources about the
skeleton. She found the interactive human skeleton that let her test
her knowledge of the correct names and functions of each bone. She
bookmarked this page so she could return for a refresher the night
before final exams.</p>


<p>When she's done with homework, Rosalind sometimes surfs through
the site in serendipity mode. Her interest in poisonous snakes led
her to articles about how certain types of venom affect the human
nervous system. One of these articles led her into an interactive
game that taught her about other chemicals (such as alcohol) that are
able to cross the blood-brain barrier. This game piqued her interest
in chemistry and she switched into investigative mode to learn more.</p>

<p>This simple scenario shows why and how users may employ both
searching and browsing within the web site. More complex scenarios
can be used to flesh out the possible needs of users from multiple
