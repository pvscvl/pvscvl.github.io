<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>



<p>Although information architecture may seem to be a high-handed and
daunting term, it's really nothing new or mysterious. Think
about it: why did the Ten Commandments come to us as two huge stone
tablets? Perhaps Moses preferred a trifold design, or a portable
wallet-size version, only to be overruled by his Project Manager. In
any case, <em class="emphasis">someone</em> decided how to present the
information to that audience of potential users milling about at the
foot of Mount Sinai.</p>


<p>From clay-tablet scribes to medieval monks to the folks who organize
your daily newspaper, information architects have contributed in
subtle but important ways to our world. Information architects have
balanced the whims of authority with those of unforgiving users of
every stripe, while forcibly fitting their efforts into the
constraints of the available information technologies. In many cases,
information architects have been responsible for major advancements
in those technologies.</p>


<p>The World Wide Web is the latest advancement in information
technology, and, as with the previous innovations, certain principles
carry over and others must be completely reexamined and overhauled.
Because the Web integrates so many technologies and content types
into a single interface, it challenges designers of web sites and
intranets greatly.</p>










<div class="sect1"><a name="ch00-2-fm2xml" />
<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Our Perspective</h2>


<p>We believe that truly successful web sites, especially large and
complex ones, demand the expertise of professionals from many
different disciplines. Besides information architects, great sites
also require the skills of programmers, graphic designers, technical
specialists, marketers, copywriters, project managers, and others.
This book concentrates on the skills needed for information
architecture; although we discuss these other disciplines when we
can, we are <em class="emphasis">not</em> graphic designers, programmers,
or anything but information architects, so everything we say about
those areas should be taken with a very large grain of salt.</p>


<p>As information architects, two major factors influence us:</p>


<ul><li><p>Our professional backgrounds in the field of information and library
studies.</p></li><li><p>Our experience in creating information architectures for large,
complex web sites, primarily for corporate clients.</p></li></ul>
<p>Many librarians have responded slowly to new information technologies
like the Web. Some
<a name="INDEX-1" />librarians feel
that their value as professionals will be diminished as
"virtual libraries" supplant those filled with physical
books and periodicals. Many librarians fear that the public will
bypass them and go directly to the source via the Internet. The truth
is, however, that skills in information organization and access are
more and more necessary in this era of information explosion. We have
found that the demand for our skills in classifying and organizing
information in web sites has grown beyond our wildest dreams, so we
believe that you, your sites, and their users will benefit from our
profession's perspective.</p>


<p>Between us, we have many years of experience in creating information
architectures for web sites and intranets. At Argus Associates, our
consulting firm, we concentrate on this area almost exclusively, and
we have helped lots of large clients develop architectures that
provide firm foundations for high quality web sites. We also have the
benefit of working with and learning from experts from other
companies who have backgrounds in other disciplines (our joint
venture is called, aptly, Allied Studios). Besides our positive
experiences, being in the "business" has given us many
opportunities to make mistakes and ample time to learn from them. We
hope you will benefit by learning from our mistakes as well as our
successes.</p>


<p>You don't need a library degree to be a successful information
architect. Despite the requirements listed in some job descriptions,
it's hard to have had years of experience within this fledgling
medium. More important than either of these two factors is common
sense, plain and simple. The Web is too new for anyone to feel secure
in claiming that there is a "right way" to do things. Web
sites are multifaceted, and can support many different ways of
presenting information. This book clarifies different approaches to
web site architecture, and provides you with the tools and concepts
you need to determine the best approach for your site.</p>
