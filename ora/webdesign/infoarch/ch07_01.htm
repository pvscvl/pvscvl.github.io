<p>
<a name="INDEX-498" /> <a name="INDEX-499" />
<a name="INDEX-500" /> <a name="INDEX-501" />So far, we've
concentrated on the component parts and principles of information
architecture design. Now, we're going to shift gears and
explore the process that brings these components and principles
together to form useful, elegant information architectures.</p>


<p>If it were just a matter of applying a few design principles to a web
site, our jobs would be easy. However, as we discussed earlier,
information architecture doesn't happen in a vacuum. The design
of large sites requires an interdisciplinary team approach that
involves graphic designers, programmers, information architects, and
other experts. For everyone to collaborate effectively, you need to
define and agree upon a relatively structured development process.
Even for smaller projects when teams might be small and individuals
might fill multiple roles, tackling the right challenges at the right
time is critical to success.</p>


<p>The next few chapters provide an overview of the three major phases
of site development. This chapter begins with a review of existing
background materials and quickly moves into a series of meetings
aimed at gathering and synthesizing information. In <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, "Conceptual Design"</a>, we cover the creative brainstorming phase
where you define the web site. <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Production and Operations"</a>, shows
how your ideas are put to the test as the site is built, tested, and
launched.</p>


<p>Throughout these chapters, we'll sometimes refer to
interactions with the <em class="emphasis">client</em>. This language
betrays our consulting backgrounds but also raises an important
point. As an architect, it's often useful to think like an
outsider (even if you're really an insider) so you can escape
preconceived notions and think outside the box.</p>


<p>Research is the first crucial step in the construction or renovation
of any large web site. You won't get too far if you don't
know what you're trying to do, and why.</p>










<div class="sect1"><a name="ch07-33735" />
<h2 class="sect1">7.1. Getting Started</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-502" /> <a name="INDEX-503" />If
you want to create a successful web site, you first must understand
the big picture. For that reason, the first step in the research
process is to ask questions. You need to get everything out into the
open: the individual visions for the site, the raw materials at your
disposal, and any possible restrictions. Only then can you develop a
solid architecture for your web site.</p>


<p>Questions you need to ask include:</p>


<ul><li><p>What are the short- and long-term goals?</p></li><li><p>What can you afford?</p></li><li><p>Who are the intended audiences?</p></li><li><p>Why will people come to your site?</p></li><li><p>What types of tasks should users be able to perform?</p></li><li><p>What types of content should and should not be part of the site?</p></li></ul>
<p>You'll find that everyone has different answers to these
questions. Inevitably, we all bring personal, professional, and
departmental biases to the table. The architect is no exception: both
the architect and designer have their own biases and ambitions. To
avoid wasted work and complications later on, you need to get these
out in the open as soon as possible.</p>


<p>When you're architecting web sites, it's very important
to get the project off to a good start. You want everyone to feel
involved, enthusiastic, and confident that you know what you're
doing. Let's explore ways to make this happen.</p>


<a name="ch07-3-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.1.1. Face-to-Face Meetings</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-504" /> <a name="INDEX-505" /> <a name="INDEX-506" />
<a name="INDEX-507" />
<a name="INDEX-508" />Because
of the political objectives and the need to establish trust and
respect, face-to-face meetings are essential during the research
phase. Only in meetings will you learn about the real goals of the
project and about the people you're working with. Only during
face-to-face conversations will you reach a comfort level that allows
both you and your colleagues to ask the difficult but necessary
questions.</p>


<p>For example, a client once asked us to design a web site that
supported the needs of the parent company and its primary subsidiary.
Based upon telephone conversations with the client we believed that
the (misguided) plan for a single point of entry to information about
both organizations was already set in stone. We assumed the client
had good reasons for this integrated approach. However, at an early
face-to-face meeting, it became apparent that the client had not put
a great deal of thought into this decision. Fortunately, we became
comfortable enough with the client at that meeting to ask the obvious
question. Within minutes, everyone agreed that two sites were needed
rather than one. This decision at such an early stage of the project
saved a great deal of potentially wasted time and money. It is often
difficult to ask such questions over the phone, because it's
difficult to establish a good comfort level without physical
proximity and eye contact.</p>

<p>The meeting agenda is an important tool for ensuring these
sessions' productivity. By thinking through the key issues that
you'd like to cover, you'll be much better prepared for
the ensuing discussions. It's a good idea to involve clients
and colleagues in the agenda setting process, so that
everyone's needs are being addressed. Agendas will vary,
depending on the project and the people involved; the sidebar on the
following page will give you a sense of what you might expect to
cover during an early meeting.<a name="INDEX-511" /> <a name="INDEX-512" /> <a name="INDEX-513" /> <a name="INDEX-514" /> <a name="INDEX-515" /></p>

<a name="ch07-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.1.2. Web Site Critiques</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-516" /> <a name="INDEX-517" />
<a name="INDEX-518" />One of the best ways to break the ice
with clients and colleagues and move towards that important comfort
level (while conducting research at the same time) involves the
review and discussion of real-world web sites. It is much easier to
express gut-level likes and dislikes about particular sites than to
talk abstractly about aesthetic and functional preferences.
It's also a lot more fun.</p>


<p>Show them web sites with a variety of architectures. Some might be
competitors' sites. Others might come from a completely
different industry. Invite them to suggest their own favorite sites
for review. As we discussed in the <a href="ch01_01.htm">Section 1.1, "Consumer Sensitivity Boot Camp"</a> exercise in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "What Makes a Web Site Work"</a>, ask them what they love and hate and why.
Point out features or approaches that you find particularly useful or
useless. Don't be afraid to encourage or express strong
feelings about specific sites. As we suggested in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "What Makes a Web Site Work"</a>, passionate consumers become caring producers.
A critique's transcript might look something like this:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Participant A:</b></dt>
<dd><p>I hate this site because it's so difficult to find the
information I need. It's like looking for a needle in a
haystack.</p></dd>


<dt><b>Participant B:</b></dt>
<dd><p>Yeah, and I can't stand their use of frames. The pages are so
chopped up and take forever to load.</p></dd>


<dt><b>Architect:</b></dt>
<dd><p>I agree. The graphic design and page layout are poorly done. What do
you think about the organization scheme?</p></dd>


<dt><b>Participant B:</b></dt>
<dd><p>There isn't one. There must be thirty links on the main page.
Some point to major content areas and some go to a single page.
It's horrible.</p></dd>


<dt><b>Architect:</b></dt>
<dd><p>Yes, you're right. It looks like they could have used an
audience-oriented architecture very successfully. Let's take a
look at a site that shows what I mean.</p></dd>

</dl>


<p>Not only are critiques a great way to stimulate interesting and
enthusiastic conversation while learning about people's
preferences, they're also a sneaky way to educate them. Use the
critique as an opportunity to explain and illustrate your ideas about
what makes a web site good. Notice that we used this devious yet
effective technique in the beginning of this book.</p>


<p>Be forewarned that participants may suggest the critique of existing
web sites or intranets created within their organization. This is
dangerous territory because some people in the room may have been
directly responsible for the design of these sites or may be good
friends with the site's designers. Proceed with caution to
avoid hurting feelings and creating enemies. Stress the fact that
it's easy to criticize in hindsight, try to encourage
constructive criticism, and be sure to point out some positive
aspects of the site. In general, the tone of these meetings should be
kept light and cooperative.</p>


<p>The most obvious and common way to conduct web site critiques is via
a connection to the Internet. Ideally, the presentation is conducted
through a powerful computer with a reliable high-speed connection.
The computer needs a sufficiently recent version of Web browsing
software with all the necessary plug-in applications. Internet
traffic congestion must not be too heavy. The web sites you visit
must be up and running. And of course, when presenting on-site, the
firewall must be negotiated.</p>


<p>As you quickly begin to see, many things can go wrong. Attempting to
explore the Web live during a meeting often brings technology to the
foreground in an intrusive way. There are better ways to solve this
communication challenge.</p>


<p>You can use offline browsers such as Web Whacker<a href="#FOOTNOTE-20">[20]</a> that quickly and easily download and package selected web
sites on a floppy disk or hard drive, maintaining the integrity of
links between offline and online pages. This allows for navigation of
web sites without the problems associated with connectivity. However,
keep in mind that these offline browsers may not handle enabling
technologies such as Java and ActiveX. Also, note that even when
using the safe approach of an offline browser, you should have a
print-based backup plan. Murphy's Law (anything that can go
wrong, will) is particularly applicable to technology-based
presentations. You might even bring candles and matches in case of a
power outage.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-20" /><p>[20]Learn about Web Whacker at
<a href="../../../../../../www.ffg.com/">http://www.ffg.com/</a> or read about other offline
browsers at<em class="emphasis">
http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Software/Reviews/Titles/Internet/Browsers/Offline_Browsers/.</em></p>

</blockquote>


<p>Alternatively, color prints of web sites mounted on cards can be an
attractive, portable way of presenting sites for review. Multiple
areas and levels of each site can be selected to show the ways in
which people can navigate and explore. It may seem silly to present
web sites on paper, but it works. By sending technology to the
background where it belongs, you can focus on communicating your
ideas.</p>


<p>Whatever technology you choose to use, it's often a good idea
to assign site reviews as homework to be done before the meeting.
This will give people the time to think more deeply about what they
do and don't like. If you take this approach, you'll be
rewarded with a more detailed discussion, though perhaps at the
expense of some spontaneity. Try it both ways and see what you
prefer.<a name="INDEX-519" /></p>

<a name="ch07-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.1.3. Information Architecture Critiques</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-520" />
<a name="INDEX-521" />Another way to get even more
specific feedback about architectural likes and dislikes is to have
people critique the information architectures of a few existing
sites. To make them focus solely on the architecture, provide them
with a text-only view of the hierarchy of each site, as shown in
<a href="ch07_01.htm">Figure 7-1</a>.</p>


<a name="ch07-19082" /><div class="figure"><img height="318" alt="Figure 7-1" src="figs/info_0701.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 7-1. Text-only view of a web site's hierarchy</h4>

<p>You'll want to accompany the sample architectures with specific
exercises that tell people what you'd like them to focus on.
The sample exercise in the sidebar on the next page shows the types
of questions you <a name="INDEX-522" /> <a name="INDEX-523" />might <a name="INDEX-524" /> <a name="INDEX-525" />ask.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The following pages contain representations of the organization
