<p>
<a name="INDEX-654" />
<a name="INDEX-655" />Before actual production of the web site
can begin, you enter an intense period of planning or pre-production,
during which the project manager must coordinate the architecture,
design, and technical components. For the architect, this is where
the blueprints meet the content. You'll want to create detailed
page-level architecture blueprints and start mapping the content.</p>


<p>With a production plan in place, the actual construction of the web
site can begin. At this point, you may find yourself engaged in the
delicate art of point-of-production architecture, trying to resolve
minor or major problems that arise as the production team charges
forward. Why are these items grouped together? Shouldn't we
break this long page into several pages? What was the architect
thinking?</p>


<p>The final stages of production are marked by extensive testing and
revision, leading up to the web site launch with the requisite
marketing extravaganza and smashing of champagne bottles on computer
screens.</p>


<p>Don't drink too much champagne, however, because an
architect's work is never done. A web site keeps growing and
changing. The information architecture can easily get out of hand,
and you must actively guide its continued development. Unfortunately,
you can't always be there as the web site grows. Architects
sometimes have little hands-on control over the site during
production, and even less after its launch. An information
architecture style guide can serve as a useful tool for maintaining
the integrity of the architecture over time, even in the absence of
the original architect. In more ideal situations where you are
involved with the site after launch, tools for tracking and analyzing
usage can help you to identify opportunities for improving the
architecture.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">9.1. Detailed Architecture Blueprints</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-656" /> <a name="INDEX-657" />
<a name="INDEX-658" />
<a name="INDEX-659" />During
<a name="INDEX-660" />
<a name="INDEX-661" />the
transition from conceptual design to production, the focus shifts
from external to internal. Rather than communicating high-level
architectural concepts to the client, your job is now to communicate
detailed organization, labeling, and navigation decisions to your
colleagues on the site development team. This shift is similar to
that in the traditional world of architecture and construction. The
architect may work closely with the client to make big picture
decisions about the layout of rooms and location of windows. However,
decisions regarding the size of nails or routing of the plumbing
typically do not involve the client. Often neither sufficient time
nor interest justifies close client involvement in these minutiae.</p>


<p>The detailed architecture blueprints serve a very practical purpose.
They must map out the entire site so that the production team can
implement your plans to the letter without requiring your physical
presence during production. The blueprints must present the complete
information hierarchy from the main page to the destination pages.
They must also detail the labeling and navigation systems to be
implemented in each area of the site.</p>


<p>The blueprints will vary from project to project, depending upon the
scope. On smaller projects, the primary audience for your blueprints
may be one or two graphic designers responsible for integrating the
architecture, design, and content. On larger projects, the primary
audience may be a technical team responsible for integrating the
architecture, design, and content through a database-driven process.
Let's consider a few examples to see what they communicate and
how they vary.</p>


<a name="ch09-36463" /><div class="figure"><img height="636" alt="Figure 9-1" src="figs/info_0901.gif" width="503" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-1. This blueprint from the SIGGRAPH 96 Conference introduces several concepts. By assigning a unique identification number (e.g., 2.2.3.1) to each component (pages and content chunks), the architect lays the groundwork for an organized production process, ideally involving the use of a database system to manage the population of the web site structure with content.</h4>

<p>As the legend suggests in <a href="ch09_01.htm">Figure 9-1</a>, there is a
distinction between a local and a remote page. A local page is a
child of the main page on that blueprint. The local page inherits
characteristics such as graphic identity and navigation elements from
its parent. In this example, the Papers Committee page inherits its
color scheme and navigation system from the Papers main page. On the
other hand, a remote page belongs to another branch of the
information hierarchy. The Session Room Layout page will show a
graphic identity and navigation system unique to the Maps area of the
web site.</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-662" />
<a name="INDEX-663" />
<a name="INDEX-664" /> <a name="INDEX-665" /> <a name="INDEX-666" />Another important concept is that of the
<em class="emphasis">content chunk</em>. To meet the needs of the content
mapping process and to allow for flexibility during the production
process, it is often necessary to separate the content from its
container. Content chunks such as Contact Us About Papers and Contact
Us About This Web Site are sections of content composed of one or
more paragraphs that can stand alone as independent packages of
information. The rectangle that surrounds these content chunks
indicates that they are closely related. By taking this approach, the
architect provides the designer with flexibility in defining the
layout. Depending upon the space each content chunk requires, the
designer may choose to present all of these chunks on one page or
create a closely knit collection of pages.</p>


<p>You may decide to also communicate the navigation system using these
detailed blueprints. In some cases, one- and two-way arrows can be
used to show navigation. However, arrows can become confusing and are
easily missed by the production staff. A sidebar is often the best
way of communicating both global and local navigation <a name="INDEX-667" /> <a name="INDEX-668" />systems <a name="INDEX-669" /> <a name="INDEX-670" /> <a name="INDEX-671" /> <a name="INDEX-672" />(see <a href="ch09_01.htm">Figure 9-2</a>).</p>
