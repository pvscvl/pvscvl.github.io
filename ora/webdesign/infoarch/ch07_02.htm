<h2 class="sect1">7.2. Defining Goals</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-528" /> <a name="INDEX-529" />In
early meetings, it's always easy to jump the gun and dive right
into juicy discussions about possible information architectures.
Sometimes you will need to ask everyone to step back and spend some
time exploring bigger picture issues like mission and vision first.</p>


<p>It's good to begin by brainstorming on mission and vision. To
get these sessions going, you might ask some of the following
questions:</p>


<ul><li><p>What is the mission of the organization?</p></li><li><p>How does the web site support that organizational mission?</p></li><li><p>Does the new medium of the Web force you to reconsider the
organization's mission?</p></li><li><p>What are the short-term goals with respect to the web site?</p></li><li><p>What are the long-term goals?</p></li><li><p>How do you envision the web site one to two years from now?</p></li></ul>
<p>Once you've had a good opportunity to brainstorm, you can lead
your colleagues through the exercise of writing a web site mission
statement, which might look something like this:</p>



<p>The mission of our web site is to create new customer relationships
and strengthen existing customer loyalty. We see our web site not
only as a promotional tool, but as a customer service tool.</p>



<p>Of course, it's easy to make fun of these touchy-feely mission
statements, and they may soon be forgotten. However, the exercise of
writing a mission statement can help a group to focus on the goals
behind the site.</p>


<p>Towards that end, it's often useful to probe for goals not
currently included in the mission statement. If the mission statement
emphasizes sales and marketing, ask about customer support or the
provision of new, innovative services. Use this exercise to explore
the full range of possibilities before moving on to more practical
matters.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-530" /> <a name="INDEX-531" /> <a name="INDEX-532" /> <a name="INDEX-533" />While it's definitely a good idea
to address ideas like mission and vision directly, it can also be
useful to take a more subtle tack by exploring opportunities for
measuring the success of the web site. In these early meetings, an
interesting and informative exercise involves challenging everyone to
think into the future, about how you're going to evaluate
whether the web site is a success or failure. The following worksheet
presents possible goals and measurement opportunities.</p>

<p>You can ask people to rank these goals and measurement opportunities
in several ways. For example, you might ask how important each factor
will be in obtaining additional funding from senior management after
the site's launch. You might also ask how difficult each
measurement opportunity will be to implement.</p>


<p>You can pass out this type of document and then encourage the group
to brainstorm about these and other ways they might measure the
site's success. How important are hard measurements that show
return on investment compared to soft measurements that demonstrate
customer satisfaction and public perception? In performing this
exercise, it's important to realize that many of these ideas
for measurement might not be practical and that decisions regarding
measurement don't need to be made at this time. It's
really just an exercise to get people thinking about these issues
