<h2 class="sect1">5.6. Non-Representational Labeling Systems</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-371" /> <a name="INDEX-372" />This chapter emphasizes the need for
labels to be familiar for users, and also that consistency and
representation are the foundations for building that familiarity. Now
that we have belabored that point, we'll counter it with
another: labeling systems should not necessarily be representational.</p>


<p>What? Would you make up your mind already?</p>


<p>Well, let's put it this way: non-representational labeling is
not something that we'd recommend using regularly. In fact,
it's difficult to determine when it should be applied.
Following are two examples where we think it succeeds.</p>


<a name="ch05-22-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.6.1. Good Head-Scratching</h3>


<p>Head-scratching is usually a Bad Thing. It means that some aspect of
a site has confused a user and is in the way of achieving the
site's main goal, namely, conveying a message. But, like
everything else, even cognitive confusion has a good side: Mystery.</p>


<p>Consider the main page shown in <a href="ch05_06.htm">Figure 5-11</a>. What
the heck is going on here? If you come to this site, you may already
have a little context, knowing in advance that it's a personal
site. If not, you might figure this out fairly quickly, as this text
uses the first person and seems to describe a personal quest. Beyond
that, this page tells nothing about what you'll find in this
site.</p>


<a name="ch05-14323" /><div class="figure"><img height="323" alt="Figure 5-11" src="figs/info_0511.gif" width="396" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-11. Is it obvious where these links lead you?</h4>

<p>But you might want to know more. The radical aspect of this page
involves its use of two brief sentences and five highly generic terms
as labels to draw the user into a very personal experience. The
labels are almost completely non-representational, and even in
context they make you wonder and want to learn more.</p>


<p>If these link labels were accompanied by more information, such as
scope notes, the effect would probably be lost:</p>


<a name="ch05-23-fm2xml" /><table border="1">



<tr>
<th>
<p>Label</p></th>
<th>
<p>Scope Note</p></th>
</tr>




<tr>
<td>
<p>where</p></td>
<td>
<p>Descriptions of various places where the author has lived.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>I</p></td>
<td>
<p>Basic information about the author.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>searching</p></td>
<td>
<p>What the author has found while searching for meaning in his life.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>it</p></td>
<td>
<p>Friends and meaning that the author found.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>unfound</p></td>
<td>
<p>What the future may have in store.</p></td>
</tr>


</table>

<p>There's no mystery if the site provided (gave away, really)
this information on the main page. Without a little mystery, this
site just wouldn't work.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">5.6.2. When You Just Have To Use Icons</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-373" />
<a name="INDEX-374" />
<a name="INDEX-375" />The same principle of mystery can apply
with iconic labels. The site shown in <a href="ch05_06.htm">Figure 5-12</a>,
Cool Central, showcases a different cool web site every few moments.
It is geared toward web site developers and is a fun counterpart to
the sponsor's other more informational site,
<em class="emphasis">webreference.com</em>. The main page is distinguished
by five holes, with miscellaneous pictures and activities (e.g.,
moving clouds, swimming fish) visible in each.</p>


<a name="ch05-14696" /><div class="figure"><img height="468" alt="Figure 5-12" src="figs/info_0512.gif" width="464" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-12. These icons don't say much individually, but taken together they convey a sense of fun and invite the user to explore them further.</h4>

<p>Each of the five holes links to a section of the site:</p>


<a name="ch05-25-fm2xml" /><table border="1">



<tr>
<th>
<p>Iconic Label Position</p></th>
<th>
<p>Leads To</p></th>
</tr>




<tr>
<td>
<p>sky and floating clouds (top left)</p></td>
<td>
<p>About Cool Central</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>swimming fish</p></td>
<td>
<p>Nick's Picks</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>penguin</p></td>
<td>
<p>Cool Central Site of the [Moment, Hour, Day, Week]</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>sky and floating clouds (top right)</p></td>
<td>
<p>Advertising Information</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>smoking detective</p></td>
<td>
<p>Nick Click, Private Eye</p></td>
</tr>


</table>

<p>Of course, none makes any sense at all, save for the detective icon,
which leads to a private eye-themed area. Of course, you'll
want to click on each just to learn what they lead to. Goofy, silly,
and weird, but in a non-serious site that exists solely for the
purpose of having fun, it works.<a name="INDEX-376" /> <a name="INDEX-377" /></p>
