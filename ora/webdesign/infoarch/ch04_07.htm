<h2 class="sect1">4.7. Designing Elegant Navigation Systems</h2>


<p>Designing navigation systems that work well is challenging.
You've got so many possible solutions to consider, and lots of
sexy technologies such as pop-up menus and dynamic site maps can
distract you from what's really important: building context,
improving flexibility, and helping the user to find the information
they need.</p>


<p>No single combination of navigation elements works for all web sites.
One size does not fit all. Rather, you need to consider the specific
goals, audience, and content for the project at hand, if you are to
design the optimal solution.</p>


<p>However, there is a process that should guide you through the
challenges of navigation system design. It begins with the hierarchy.
As the primary navigation system, the hierarchy influences all other
decisions. The choice of major categories at the highest levels of
the web site will determine design of the global navigation system.
Based on the hierarchy, you will be able to select key pages (or
types of pages) that should be accessible from every other page on
the web site. In turn, the global navigation system will determine
design of the local and then ad hoc navigation systems. At each level
of granularity, your design of the higher-order navigation system
will influence decisions at the next level.</p>


<p>Once you've designed the integrated navigation system, you can
consider the addition of one or more remote navigation elements. In
most cases, you will need to choose between a table of contents, an
index, and a site map. Is the hierarchy strong and clear? Then
perhaps a table of contents makes sense. Does the hierarchy get in
the way? Then you might consider an index. Does the information lend
itself to visualization? If so, a site map may be appropriate. Is
there a need to help new or prospective users to understand what they
can do with the site? Then you might add a guided tour.</p>


<p>If the site is large and complex, you can employ two or more of these
elements. A table of contents and an index can serve different users
with varying needs. However, you must consider the potential user
confusion caused by multiple options and the additional overhead
required to design and maintain these navigation elements. As always,
it's a delicate balancing act.</p>


<p>If life on the high wire unnerves you, be sure to build some
usability testing into the navigation system design process. Only by
learning from users can you design and refine an elegant navigation
system that really works.<a name="INDEX-296" /></p>
