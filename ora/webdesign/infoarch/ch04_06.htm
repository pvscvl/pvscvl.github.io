<h2 class="sect1">4.6. Remote Navigation Elements</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-268" /> <a name="INDEX-269" /> <a name="INDEX-270" />Remote navigation elements or supplemental
navigation systems such as tables of contents, indexes, and site maps
are external to the basic hierarchy of a web site and provide an
alternative bird's-eye view of the site's content.
Increasingly, we are seeing these remote navigation elements
displayed outside of the main browser window, in either a separate
target window or in a Java-based remote control panel. While remote
navigation elements can enhance access to web site content by
providing complementary ways of navigating, they should not be used
as replacements or bandages for poor organization and navigation
systems. In many ways, remote navigation elements are similar to
software documentation or help systems. Documentation can be very
useful but will never save a bad product. Instead, remote navigation
elements should be used to complement a solid internal organization
and navigation system. You should provide them but never rely on
them.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">4.6.1. The Table of Contents</h3>


<p>The <a name="INDEX-271" />
<a name="INDEX-272" /> <a name="INDEX-273" />
<a name="INDEX-274" /> <a name="INDEX-275" />table of contents and the index are
the state of the art in print navigation. Given that the design of
these familiar systems is the result of testing and refinement over
the centuries, we should not overlook their value for web sites.</p>


<p>In a book or magazine, the table of contents presents the top few
levels of the information hierarchy. It shows the organization
structure for the printed work and supports random as well as linear
access to the content through the use of chapter and page numbers.
Similarly, the table of contents for a web site presents the top few
levels of the hierarchy. It provides a broad view of the content in
the site and facilitates random access to segmented portions of that
content. A web-based table of contents can employ hypertext links to
provide the user with direct access to pages of the site.</p>


<p>You should consider using a table of contents for web sites that lend
themselves to hierarchical organization. If the architecture is not
strongly hierarchical, it makes no sense to present the parent-child
relationships implicit in a structured table of contents. You should
also consider the web site's size when deciding whether to
employ a table of contents. For a small site with only two or three
hierarchical levels, a table of contents may be unnecessary.</p>


<p>The design of a table of contents significantly affects its
usability. When working with a graphic designer, make sure he or she
understands the following rules of thumb:</p>


<ol><li><p>Reinforce the information hierarchy so the user becomes increasingly
familiar with how the content is organized.</p></li><li><p>Facilitate fast, direct access to the contents of the site for those
users who know what they want.</p></li><li><p>Avoid overwhelming the user with too much information. The goal is to
help, not scare, the user.</p></li></ol>
<p>The <em class="emphasis">Search/Browse</em> area of the Argus
Clearinghouse, shown in <a href="ch04_06.htm">Figure 4-14</a>, provides an
example of a table of contents.</p>

This table of contents allows users to select a category (e.g., Arts &amp; Humanities) or jump directly to a subcategory (e.g., architecture). Because of the clean page layout, users can quickly scan the major and minor categories for the topic they're interested in.</h4>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-276" />Graphics can be used in the design and layout of a table of contents, providing the designer with a finer degree of control over the presentation. Colors, font styles, and a variety of graphic elements can be applied to create a well-organized and aesthetically pleasing table of contents. However, keep in mind that a graphic table of contents will cost more to design and maintain and may slow down the page loading speed for the user. When designing a navigation tool such as a table of contents, form is less important than function.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">4.6.2. The Index</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-277" />For web
sites that aren't conducive to strong hierarchical
organization, a manually created index can be a good alternative to
the more structured table of contents. Similar to an index found in
print materials, a web-based index presents keywords or phrases
alphabetically, without representing the hierarchy. Unlike a table of
contents, indexes generally are flat and present only one or two
levels of depth. Therefore, indexes work very well for users who
already know the name of the item they are looking for. A quick scan
of the alphabetical listing will get them where they want to go.</p>


<p>A major challenge in indexing a web site involves the level of
<a name="INDEX-278" />granularity
of indexing. Do you index web pages? Do you index individual
paragraphs or concepts that are presented on web pages? Or do you
index collections of web pages? In many cases, the answer may be
<em class="emphasis">all of the above</em>. Perhaps a more valuable
question is: <em class="emphasis">What terms are users going to look
for?</em>
<a name="INDEX-279" /> Its answers should guide the
index design. To answer this question, you need to know your audience
and understand their needs. Before launch of the site, you can learn
more about the terms that users will look for through focus group
sessions and individual user interviews. After launch, you can employ
a query tracking tool that captures and presents all search terms
entered by users. Analysis of these actual user search terms should
determine refinement of the index. (To learn more about query
tracking tools, see <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Production and Operations"</a>.)</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-280" />In selecting items for the index, keep in
mind that an index should point only to destination pages, not
navigation pages. Navigation pages help users find (destination)
pages through the use of menus that begin on the main page and
descend through the hierarchy. They are often heavy on links and
light on text. In contrast, destination pages contain the content
that users are trying to find. The purpose of the index is to enable
users to bypass the navigation pages and jump directly to these
content-bearing destination pages.
<a name="INDEX-281" /></p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-282" />
<a name="INDEX-283" />
<a name="INDEX-284" />
<a name="INDEX-285" />A useful
trick in designing an index involves term rotation, also known as
permutation. A permuted index rotates the words in a phrase so that
users can find the phrase in two places in the alphabetical sequence.
For example, in the SIGGRAPH 96 index shown in <a href="ch04_06.htm">Figure 4-15</a>, users will find listings for both
<em class="emphasis">New Orleans Maps</em> and <em class="emphasis">Maps (New
Orleans)</em>. This supports the varied ways people look for
information. Term rotation should be applied selectively. You need to
balance the probability of users seeking a particular term with the
annoyance of cluttering the index with too many permutations. For
example, it would probably not make sense to present Sunday
(Schedule) as well as Schedule (Sunday). If you have the time and
budget to conduct focus groups or user testing, that's great.
If not, you'll have to fall back on your common sense.

The SIGGRAPH 96 index allows for multiple levels of granularity. Selecting "New Orleans" will take you to a page that introduces this adventurous city and includes a number of links. One of those links takes you to a New Orleans map. Since this map is judged to be an important content item, it is also presented in the index.</h4>

<h3 class="sect2">4.6.3. The Site Map</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-287" /> <a name="INDEX-288" /> <a name="INDEX-289" />While the term <em class="emphasis">site
map</em> is used indiscriminately in general practice, we
define it narrowly as a graphical representation of the architecture
of a web site. This definition excludes tables of contents and
indexes that use graphic elements to enhance the aesthetic appeal of
tools that are primarily textual. A real site map presents the
information architecture in a way that goes beyond textual
representation.</p>


<p>Unlike tables of contents and indexes, maps have not traditionally
been used to facilitate navigation through bodies of text. Maps are
typically used for navigating physical rather than intellectual
space. This is significant for a few reasons. First, users are not
familiar with the use of site maps. Second, designers are not
familiar with the design of site maps. Third, most bodies of text
(including most web sites) do not lend themselves to graphical
representations. As we discussed in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Organizing Information"</a>,
many web sites incorporate multiple organization schemes and
structures. Presenting this web of hypertextual relationships
visually is difficult. These reasons help explain why we see few good
examples on the Web of site maps that can improve navigation systems.</p>


<p><a href="ch04_06.htm">Figure 4-16</a> shows a site map from <a href="../../../../../../www.sgml.net/">http://www.sgml.net</a>. To learn more about
automatically generated site maps, see <a href="../../../../../../www.webreview.com/97/05/16/infoarch/index.html">http://www.webreview.com/97/05/16/infoarch/index.html</a>.</p>


<a name="ch04-28433" /><div class="figure"><img height="298" alt="Figure 4-16" src="figs/info_0416.gif" width="328" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-16.  In this example of an automatically generated site map, gold bars represent pages within a web site. Users must roll their cursor over a gold bar to see the title of the page. Do you think this approach is more useful than a text-based table of contents?</h4>

<p>If you decide to try a site map, consider physical versus symbolic
representation. Maps of the physical world do not present the exact
geography of an area. Accuracy and scale are often sacrificed for
representative contextual clues that help us find our way through the
maze of highways and byways to our destination. Often, the higher the
level of abstraction, the more intuitive the map. This rule of thumb
holds true for all of the remote navigation elements of web sites.
When consulting a table of contents or index or site map, a user
doesn't need to see every single link on every single page.
They need to see the important links, presented in a clear and
meaningful way.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">4.6.4. The Guided Tour</h3>


<p>A <a name="INDEX-290" />guided tour serves as a nice tool for
introducing new users to the major content areas of a web site. It
can be particularly important for restricted access web sites (such
as online magazines that charge subscription fees) because you need
to show potential customers what they will get for their money.</p>


<p>A guided tour should feature linear navigation (new users want to be
guided, not thrown in), but a hypertextual navigation bar may be used
to provide additional flexibility. The tour should combine
screenshots of major pages with narrative text that explains what can
be found in each area of the web site. See <a href="ch04_06.htm">Figure 4-17</a> for an example.</p>


<a name="ch04-33152" /><div class="figure"><img height="399" alt="Figure 4-17" src="figs/info_0417.gif" width="492" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-17. In this example, the navigation options on each screen allow users to move through the guided tour in a non-linear manner.</h4>

<p>Remember that a guided tour is intended as an introduction for new
users and as a marketing opportunity for the web site. Many people
may never use it, and few people will use it more than once. For that
reason, you might consider linking to the tour from the
<a name="INDEX-291" />gateway
page<a href="#FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a> rather than the main page. Also, you should
balance the inevitable big ideas about how to create an exciting,
dynamic, interactive guided tour with the fact that it will not play
a central role in the day to day use of the web <a name="INDEX-292" />site. <a name="INDEX-293" /> <a name="INDEX-294" /> <a name="INDEX-295" /></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-10" /><p>[10]Web sites sometimes have a gateway page that
first-time users encounter before reaching the main page. This
gateway might serve as a splash page with fancy graphics and
animation, as an audience-selection page that sends users to the
appropriate area of a site, or as a preview page that shows users
what they will get if they subscribe to that particular web
site.</p>
