<h2 class="sect1">2.2. Who Should Be the Information Architect?</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-48" />The information architect of a large,
complex web site should be two things: someone who can think as an
outsider and be sensitive to the needs of the site's users, and
at the same time is enough of an insider to understand the
site's sponsoring organization, its mission, goals, content,
audiences, and inner workings. In terms of disciplinary background,
the information architect should combine the generalist's
ability to understand the perspectives of other disciplines with
specialized skills in visualizing, organizing, and labeling
information. As it's very difficult for someone to retain all
of these characteristics, you'll have to make some compromises,
but it's important to consider them as you search for that
elusive information architect.</p>


<a name="ch02-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.2.1. Thinking Like an Outsider</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-49" /> <a name="INDEX-50" /> <a name="INDEX-51" />Because information architecture is
largely about the big picture view of the organization, its goals,
and its politics, a logical choice for the architect role is a senior
person who knows the organization as a whole and who isn't
involved exclusively within the activities of one department. A
senior person can often think like an outsider even though being on
the inside, and has enough clout to enlist other departments'
resources when necessary. One drawback to choosing a senior level
manager is that he or she may have so many other responsibilities
that the work gets delegated out to staff, thereby negating the
original goal of using a single, organizationally savvy person.</p>


<p>Another approach is bringing in a true outsider: a new hire or a
consultant (we typically function in the latter role, but we are
trying to avoid biasing our discussion too greatly). The great thing
about outsiders is that they can get away with asking naive questions
considered suicidal by insiders, such as "Why does your
organization have two completely separate order fulfillment
departments? The web site will confuse users if they can order
products in two different, unresolved ways. Are there any politics
going on here that we can get past to improve the site's
design?"</p>


<p>Further, an outsider can ensure that the organization chart
isn't the site's architecture, and challenge confusing
orgspeak labels: "`Total Quality Product Dissemination
Systems'? Oh, you mean `Product Shipping
Options.'" The drawbacks of bringing in a true outsider
are that they can be expensive and can lack sufficient knowledge of
the organization to do the job, thus delaying the project's
progress.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch02-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.2.2. Thinking Like an Insider</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-52" /> <a name="INDEX-53" />As many organizations can't afford to
outsource information architecture services or move a head honcho
into the role, the responsibility often goes to an insider who is not
a senior level manager. Sometimes this is ideal; it's the
people in the trenches who often know the most about an
organization's processes, and how to get things done within
that organization. For example, who knows an external web
site's audiences better than a marketing specialist, sales rep,
or product manager? Who knows an intranet's intended audiences
better than a human resources specialist, corporate librarian, or
switchboard operator? How many senior level managers can describe
every step of their organization's fulfillment process, from
product ordering to computing sales tax and shipping charges to
warehouse picking to delivery? Someone needs this knowledge to mirror
the process on the web site.</p>


<p>The problem with a lower-level person is that his or her knowledge
may be too specific. Additionally, such a person often lacks the
political base required to mobilize cooperation from others in the
organization. A possible solution is to make information architecture
this person's only job responsibility. This could allow him or
her to step away from original duties and focus on the broader needs
of the organization and the users of its site.<a name="INDEX-54" /> <a name="INDEX-55" /></p>

<a name="ch02-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.2.3. Disciplinary Background</h3>


<p>Since information architecture is a relatively new field, you
can't just post a job description and expect a flock of
interested, competent, and experienced candidates to show up on your
doorstep. Instead, you'll need to actively recruit, outsource,
or perhaps <em class="emphasis">become</em> the information architect for
your site. If you are looking for someone else, you might consider
the disciplines listed below as potential sources. If you're on
your own, it might be worthwhile to learn a little bit about each of
these disciplines yourself. Or, if possible, find someone
knowledgeable about them to work with you and complement your own
expertise. In either case, remember that no single discipline is the
obvious source for information architects; each presents its own
strengths and weaknesses.</p>


<a name="ch02-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.2.3.1. Graphic design</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-56" />
<a name="INDEX-57" />Most people who
have written about and practice information architecture are graphic
designers by training. This is not surprising; as mentioned, graphic
design is much more than creating pretty pictures. It is geared more
toward creating <em class="emphasis">relationships</em> between visual
elements and determining their effective integration as a whole. On a
page, printed or HTML, these elements include white space and
typography as well as images. So graphic designers traditionally have
been focused on the architectures of individual pages of information,
which can be a weakness when building a web
<em class="emphasis">site</em>.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch02-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.2.3.2. Information and library science</h3>


<p>We've found that our backgrounds in
<a name="INDEX-58" />
<a name="INDEX-59" />information science and librarianship have
proven very useful in dealing with the relationships between pages
and other elements that make up a whole site. By definition,
librarians deal with organization of and access to information within
information systems and are trained to work with searching, browsing,
and indexing technologies. Forward-looking librarians (recently
described as <em class="firstterm">cybrarians</em>) see that their
expertise applies in new arenas unrelated to providing access to
printed information stored in traditional libraries. So librarianship
is an important discipline to turn to for information architecture
expertise. Just remember that librarians are also prone to get lost
in details, a weakness that can distract from determining the big
picture of a web site.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch02-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.2.3.3. Journalism</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-60" />Journalists, like librarians, are trained at
organizing information, but in a different setting. If your web site
delivers highly dynamic information, like a news wire or a push
technology-based service, someone with a journalism background might
have a great sense of how to best organize and deliver this
information. Because of their writing experience, journalists are
also good candidates for architecting sites that will have high
levels of edited content. Occasionally, journalists who move into
information architecture find themselves intellectually constrained
by their experience in organizing information for print and other
traditional media.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch02-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.2.3.4. Usability engineering</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-61" />Usability engineers are experts at
testing and evaluating how systems work. For information systems,
they measure such criteria as how long it takes users to learn how to
use a system, how long it takes them to find information in a system,
and how many errors they make along the way. Of all the disciplines
we list, usability engineering is probably the most scientific in its
view of users and the quality of their experiences with information
systems. Keep in mind that usability engineers concentrate on
measuring a system's performance, not in designing or
redesigning a system. (Of course, measurements of a site's
performance can greatly determine how redesign should proceed.)</p>
</div>



<a name="ch02-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.2.3.5. Marketing</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-62" />Marketing
specialists are expert at understanding audiences and communicating a
message effectively to different audiences. This skill is especially
valuable not only in designing externally oriented web sites, but
also for intranets, which often have multiple audiences with very
different needs. Marketing expertise can ensure that the message is
presented in a user-oriented manner and not buried in organizational
jargon. If your site is geared especially toward selling products and
building brand-awareness, someone from your organization's
marketing department might do the trick. The drawback to
marketing-based approaches is the danger that they are more geared
toward selling rather than helping users, and so may not be
appropriate for certain types of web sites and audiences.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch02-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.2.3.6. Computer science</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-63" />Programmers and computer specialists bring an
important skill to information architecture, especially to
architecting information from the bottom up. For example, often a
site requires a database to serve the content; this minimizes
maintenance and data integrity problems. Computer scientists have the
best skills for modeling content for inclusion in a database.
However, unlike librarians or usability engineers, computer
scientists aren't necessarily trained in user-centered
approaches to designing information systems.</p>


<p>So, an information architect might come from one of many different
disciplines. He or she will certainly need to know at least a little
about every type of expertise involved in the entire web site design
and development process, because his or her work will affect every
part of the process. The architect also needs to be the keeper of the
big picture as this process unfolds and the details of design and
production become the main focus of all involved.</p>


<p>Perhaps the most important quality in an information architect is the
ability to think outside the lines, to come up with new approaches to
designing information systems. The Web provides many opportunities to
do things in ways that haven't been done before. Many sites are
pushing the envelope of design, architecture, and technology. While
it's tempting to create a site that mirrors the same old things
that an organization already does in other media (e.g., product
brochures, annual reports), this approach could severely damage your
site's chances for success. If a site doesn't rise to the
occasion for its users, it won't fare well in head-to-head
competition with other sites. This medium is more competitive than
any other. One click, and a site becomes one of thousands that the
user visits once but never returns to. It's the responsibility
of the architect more than anyone else to prevent this outcome and
ensure that the user encounters a site designed to take best
advantage of the medium.</p>

<a name="ch02-14-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.2.4. Balance Your Perspective</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-64" />
<a name="INDEX-65" />Whomever you do use as an
information architect, remember: everyone (including us) is biased by
their disciplinary perspective. If possible, try to ensure that other
disciplines are represented on your web site development team to
guarantee a balanced architecture.</p>


<p>Also, no matter your perspective, the information architect ideally
should be solely responsible for the site's architecture, and
<em class="emphasis">not</em> for its other aspects. It can be distracting
to be responsible for other, more tangible aspects of the site, such
as its graphic identity. In this case, the site's architecture
can easily, if unintentionally, get relegated to secondary status
because the architect is concentrating, naturally, on the tangible
stuff.</p>


<p>However, with smaller organizations, limited resources mean that all
or most aspects of the site's development -- design,
editorial, technical, architecture, and production -- are likely
to be the responsibility of one person. Our best advice for someone
in this position is obvious but worth mentioning: 1) find a group of
friends and colleagues who are willing to be a sounding board for
your ideas, and 2) practice a sort of controlled schizophrenia in
which you make a point to look at your site from different
perspectives; first from the architect's, then from the
designer's, and <a name="INDEX-66" /> <a name="INDEX-67" /> <a name="INDEX-68" />so on.</p>
