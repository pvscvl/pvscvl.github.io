<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>




<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>


<p>The animal featured on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Information
Architecture</em> is a polar bear (<em class="emphasis">Ursus
maritimus</em>). Polar bears live primarily on the icy shores of
Greenland and northern North America and Asia. They are very strong
swimmers, and rarely venture far from the water. The largest land
carnivore, male polar bears weigh from 770 to 1400 pounds. Female
polar bears are much smaller, weighing 330 to 550 pounds. The
preferred meal of polar bears is ringed seals and bearded seals. When
seals are unavailable they will eat fish, reindeer, birds, berries,
and trash.</p>


<p>Polar bears are, of course, well adapted to living in the Arctic
Circle. Their black skin is covered in thick, water-repellant, white
fur. Adult polar bears are protected from the cold by a layer of
blubber that is more than four inches thick. They are so well
insulated, in fact, that overheating can be a problem. For this reason
they move slowly on land, taking frequent breaks. Their large feet
spread out their substantial weight, allowing them to walk on thin ice
surfaces that animals weighing far less would break through. Because
food is available year-round, most polar bears don't
hibernate. Pregnant females are the exception, and the tiny 1 to 1 1/2
pound cubs are born during the hibernation period.</p>


<p>Polar bears have no natural enemies. Their greatest threat comes
from hunting, but in the past 15 years most governments have placed
strict limits on the hunting of polar bears. Their population has more
than doubled in that time, and is now estimated to be between 21,000
and 28,000. They are not considered to be endangered. They are
extremely aggressive and dangerous animals. While many bears actively
avoid human contact, polar bears tend to view humans as prey. In
encounters between humans and polar bears, the bear almost always
wins.</p>


<p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using a
19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The cover
layout was produced with Quark XPress 3.3 using the ITC Garamond
font.</p>


<p>The inside layout was designed by Nancy Priest and implemented
in FrameMaker 5.0 by Mike Sierra. The text and heading fonts are ITC
Garamond Light and Garamond Book. The screen shots that appear in the
book were created in Adobe Photoshop 4.0 and the illustrations were
created in Macromedia Freehand 7.0 by Robert Romano. This colophon was
written by Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary.</p>
