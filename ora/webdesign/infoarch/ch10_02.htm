<h2 class="sect1">10.2. A Case Study: Henry Ford Health System</h2>


<p>The <a name="INDEX-749" /> <a name="INDEX-750" />Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) is
one of the largest health care providers in Michigan, with over
17,000 employees and almost $2 billion in annual revenues. They
approached Argus and its strategic partners, Q LTD (which provides
graphic design and editorial services) and InterConnect of Ann Arbor
(which provides programming and technical design consulting) to
create an external corporate web site from scratch. Needless to say,
we were delighted to take on the project. We also realized that we
would need to avoid the usual problems of main page crowding,
political jockeying, poor navigation, and inconsistent look and feel
that were abundant in many other health care organizations'
sites. Although the HFHS internal Internet committee was very
sensitive to these problems, we all faced a huge challenge of
creating a useful, user-centered site for such a large corporation.</p>


<a name="ch10-3-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.2.1. Org Chart as Default Architecture</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-751" />We began with the assumption that
we could not force the 90 or so HFHS hospitals, medical centers,
departments, units, and programs to halt their own web development
efforts and comply with the look and feel of the site we were about
to create. In fact, it would be better to accept the reality that
sites grow organically within an organization, and build a strong
umbrella site around these local islands of corporate information.
So, we began visualizing an architecture that looked like the one in
<a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-1</a>.</p>


<a name="ch10-25705" /><div class="figure"><img height="286" alt="Figure 10-1" src="figs/info_1001.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-1. The Org Chart architecture. It obviously won't scale well for most large organizations. Imagine a main page with links to 90 sub-sites... on second thought, we're sure you've seen quite a few of those!</h4>

<p>Each sub-site represented an <em class="emphasis">organizational entity
</em>: a department, unit, division, medical center, hospital,
or program sponsored by HFHS. We learned from our initial research
that many of these entities did not yet have their own sub-sites,
although they would over time. Some entities might never create their
own sub-sites. So the reality of their web environment really looked
a bit more like <a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-2</a>.</p>


<a name="ch10-21621" /><div class="figure"><img height="334" alt="Figure 10-2" src="figs/info_1002.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-2. Expecting future growth</h4>

<p>The organization scheme at this point very closely mirrored the
political boundaries of the HFHS org chart. Users might come to the
main page of such a site and find prominent links to the Department
of Gynecology next to the Office of the President. Also, as HFHS is a
large organization, there would be many more links than the five
represented here. So how could we leave these default organic
partitions of information in place, and yet provide a more usable,
user-centered view? We had to find a way to cut across the grain of
the org chart, yet leave it in place (see <a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-3</a>).</p>


<a name="ch10-40728" /><div class="figure"><img height="456" alt="Figure 10-3" src="figs/info_1003.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-3. Unless we come up with a better solution, the site will be organized like an "org chart" (the horizontal dotted lines). Can we cut "across the grain" of the org chart (the vertical dotted lines) for a more user-centered approach?</h4>
</div>




<a name="ch10-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.2.2. Sub-Site Record Pages</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-752" />
<a name="INDEX-753" />Our
solution was to create a database of records or meta-information
pages to represent each sub-site. These sub-site record pages include
information <em class="emphasis">about</em> each sub-site, and are
centrally created and controlled by HFHS. Together, they serve as a
catalog for the site's sub-sites; using database technology,
they are easy to maintain and content duplication is minimized. The
fields in these records and the relationships between each type of
record were determined through a fairly conventional process of data
modeling. The use of fielded information supports improved
information retrieval, as described in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Searching Systems"</a>.
Also, the whole structure of sub-site records can be bypassed if need
be, with users bookmarking an individual sub-site's main page
if they so desire.</p>


<p>The sub-site record approach allows the sub-sites themselves to be
controlled autonomously and anticipates sub-site growth well. If a
sub-site existed, a sub-site record page would also link to the
sub-site. If no sub-site existed yet (e.g., sub-site records 4
through 6 in <a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-4</a>), the sub-site record would
serve as a placeholder until it could be linked to a new sub-site. If
a particular department wasn't likely to ever create a
sub-site, the sub-site records would at least provide useful
information about that department (e.g., sub-site record 3).</p>


<a name="ch10-21869" /><div class="figure"><img height="456" alt="Figure 10-4" src="figs/info_1004.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-4. Sub-site record pages allow other ways of accessing the site's content, and help delineate responsibility for content ownership and management.</h4>
</div>




<a name="ch10-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.2.3. Labeling Systems for Sub-Site Record Pages</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-754" />To address the need to cut across the
grain of the default org chart-centered organization scheme, the
sub-site record pages include manually created keyword indexing to
support various user-centered means of accessing the sub-sites. In
this case, we worked with HFHS' staff librarians to index each
sub-site using medical terms in schemes that matched their two
primary audiences: one controlled vocabulary for medical
professionals and another for regular people. On each sub-site record
page, these terms were shown together in one keywords field. Within
that field, the keywords served as links to other sub-site record
pages which had been similarly indexed, which can greatly enhance
user navigation (for example, users can find other HFHS resources
that are related to cancer -- see <a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-5</a>).</p>


<a name="ch10-36975" /><div class="figure"><img height="377" alt="Figure 10-5" src="figs/info_1005.gif" width="482" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-5. A sample sub-site record page can work as a placeholder or as a link to the actual sub-site. It also helps maintain a look and feel consistent with the remainder of the umbrella site.</h4>

<p>These topical keywords provide access to the HFHS sub-sites'
content in a more user-centered manner than the org chart approach
did. We also provided other ways of navigating the sub-sites,
leveraging the sub-site records to allow browsing by Organizational
Resource (e.g., hospital vs. program vs. department and so on), and
by location (City). And we did maintain a browsable org-chart index
(Browse By Organizational Resources); browsing the site in this way
remains useful in certain cases, especially for internal audiences.</p>
</div>




<a name="ch10-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.2.4. Searching System</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-755" />We also included a searching facility to
allow for fast known-item searching (and, as you can see in <a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-6</a>, we integrated it with the browsing options).
Queries are run against a set of fields that we selected from the
sub-site record pages, including document titles, descriptions, and
keywords. Such selective indexing supports improved searching results
because queries are run against homogeneous information created and
maintained by the same central authority. The results are far more
consistent than if a single index of all the content in all of the
sub-sites could be created. Creating such an index could also be
challenging if the owners of certain sub-sites disallowed spiders to
crawl their sites.</p>


<a name="ch10-18050" /><div class="figure"><img height="484" alt="Figure 10-6" src="figs/info_1006.gif" width="459" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-6. Multiple means of searching and browsing the sub-site record pages' content.</h4>

<p>The architecture now looked something like that in <a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-7</a>.</p>


<a name="ch10-19039" /><div class="figure"><img height="443" alt="Figure 10-7" src="figs/info_1007.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-7. Another view of the multiple means of browsing and searching the sub-site record collection. </h4>

<p>This architecture provides quick and easy access to content in
sub-sites, especially for users who already know what they're
looking for or who understand a bit about the nature of HFHS. Users
can get straightforward lists of all that HFHS has to offer by city,
by keywords, by searching, and so on. But what about users who
don't really know what they're looking for? Or those who
need a warm, fuzzy introduction to the Henry Ford Health System in
general?</p>
</div>




<a name="ch10-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.2.5. Guides</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-756" />
<a name="INDEX-757" />To give users, especially first-timers, a view
of the HFHS web environment that goes beyond raw lists of sub-sites,
we worked with HFHS staff to create guides<a href="#FOOTNOTE-22">[22]</a> to HFHS and its information. Guides
add value to the user's experience by telling a story about the
site; in effect, they come as close as the Web can to serving as
friendly tour guides. They wrap narrative text around featured links
to sub-site record pages (or, for that matter, actual sub-site
content) in a way that educates users about the site and its sponsor
(in this way, they can allow marketing goals to be met). They can
stand alone: guides provide value for users even if they don't
wish to pursue the links. Guides also can be customized for different
audiences or needs, and they can exist somewhat independently of the
changes that might happen in the sub-sites themselves.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-22" /><p>[22]In this
book, we mention the Argus Clearinghouse
(<a href="../../../../../../www.clearinghouse.net/">http://www.clearinghouse.net</a>) on a number of
occasions. The mission of the site is to serve as a central access
point for guides to the Internet. If you're interested in
seeing hundreds of examples of guides, try the Argus
Clearinghouse.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>For HFHS, we identified major information needs that users might have
when they reached the HFHS main page. Besides wanting to find a
sub-site (which we'd already covered with the architecture
we've shown so far), users might be members of four primary
audiences:</p>


<ul><li><p><em class="emphasis">Medical students</em> who were considering doing
their residencies at HFHS.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Researchers</em>, both internal and external, who
want to keep abreast of the role that HFHS plays in medical research.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Patients</em> who want to know about the care they
could receive at HFHS.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Generic users</em> who want to know about
HFHS in general.</p></li></ul>
<p>We knew other audiences could be served by guides, and that there
were other ways to define guides, such as by topic or task. But,
after much discussion, we felt that these four guides would address
the needs of perhaps 80% of first-time users of the site. What about
the additional 20%? We hoped that they would be served by the Help
Yourself search and browse features. Realistically, our feeling is
that most sites' main pages probably don't address even
50% of their users' needs, so we felt that 80% was a pretty
good goal. (In fact, the 80/20 Rule is good for web developers in
general; use it to remind yourself that you can't always
satisfy 100% of all possible users of your site, but that if you can
assist 80%, your site will do better than the majority of its
competitors.)</p>


<p>Each of the four guides would describe HFHS's offerings in a
style that best fit the needs of each audience. Also, each guide
would link to the subset of HFHS sub-sites that was relevant to that
particular audience (see <a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-8</a>).</p>


<a name="ch10-14273" /><div class="figure"><img height="484" alt="Figure 10-8" src="figs/info_1008.gif" width="459" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-8. A sample guide's main page. Audience-specific narrative text is on the right and links to sub-site records and other useful resources on the left.</h4>
</div>




<a name="ch10-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.2.6. Multiple Pathways to Content</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-758" /> <a name="INDEX-759" />Now our architecture supported
different ways to get users to information in the HFHS Web
environment. Users doing exploratory searching could easily move back
and forth between browsing and searching a catalog of sub-site
records. Known-item searchers and repeat users could go right to the
search engine or quickly scan the browsable indices. New users who
wanted a better sense of what HFHS offers could get a taste through
any of the four guides to selected HFHS sub-sites. The top-level
information architecture was nearing completion (see <a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-9</a>).</p>


<a name="ch10-14893" /><div class="figure"><img height="478" alt="Figure 10-9" src="figs/info_1009.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-9. Value-added guides complement searching and browsing plain lists of resources.</h4>

<p>There were still some other areas we'd not yet dealt with. One
area was the news announcements and press releases that HFHS would
naturally want to make available. We created a news area in the site
and augmented it with a dynamic billboard that showed news headlines
and, when clicked, would take users to the story that it had
introduced. The billboard adds nice visual splash to the main page.
It also helps defuse potentially sticky political situations by
unburying sub-site content that deserves occasional exposure on the
main page. At this point, we also added the de rigeur "About
HFHS" section. So the final top-level architecture looked like
<a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-10</a>.</p>


<a name="ch10-29805" /><div class="figure"><img height="486" alt="Figure 10-10" src="figs/info_1010.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-10. The full architecture, including two new ways of reaching content (news and the dynamic billboard).</h4>

<p>Pretty confusing, eh? Certainly the blueprint diagram is
overwhelming; that's why we always use mock-up pages at this
point in the conceptual design phase. However, when you look at the
final product, the main page for this site (<a href="ch10_02.htm">Figure 10-11</a>), you will note its simplicity.</p>


<a name="ch10-23060" /><div class="figure"><img height="411" alt="Figure 10-11" src="figs/info_1011.gif" width="460" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 10-11. The HFHS site's main page -- a concise gateway to a complex information environment</h4>

<p>The HFHS main page has few links, a balance between static and
dynamic information (e.g., the dynamic billboard at the top of the
page), and no names of departments, units, or other political
entities that might typically sneak their way there due to political
infighting. Yet it provides users with <em class="emphasis">ten</em> ways
to reach information in the HFHS Web environment:</p>


<ol><li><p>Browse by Keyword (both medical and lay)</p></li><li><p>Browse by Organizational Resource</p></li><li><p>Browse by City</p></li><li><p>Search</p></li><li><p>Patient Care Guide</p></li><li><p>Research Guide</p></li><li><p>Education Guide</p></li><li><p>About HFHS Guide</p></li><li><p>News Area</p></li><li><p>Dynamic Billboard<a name="INDEX-760" /> <a name="INDEX-761" /></p></li></ol>
</div>




<a name="ch10-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.2.7. Conclusion</h3>


<p>We addressed the issues of politics and main page cluttering by
creating additional real estate, in the form of guides, just off that
most prime real estate, the main page. We moved mention of and links
to individual sub-sites from that main page to these guides, thus
reducing the clutter of the main page. This approach could be
embodied as a policy that would stand up to any unit or department
demanding to be linked to from the main page.</p>


<p>We also architected and created a catalog of the entire HFHS Web
environment. This alone was a first for the organization: there had
never been a comprehensive, up-to-date publicly accessible catalog of
HFHS and its offerings. This represented a huge value-add for users.
From a maintenance perspective, the sub-site record pages, as well as
the various browsable indices, could all be generated by a database.
New records could be added without affecting the overall
architecture.</p>


<p>We addressed navigation challenges by creating many different ways
for users to browse information, and applying these navigation
systems consistently on the site's pages (thanks in part to
generating these pages from a database with easily configurable
templates). We believe that searching performs better thanks to the
use of search zones and controlled vocabularies.</p>


<p>Lastly, we allowed sub-sites to maintain their own personalities
independently of the umbrella site. We also provided a style guide
for others at HFHS to create sub-sites that match the umbrella
site's look and feel. Better a carrot than a stick!</p>


<p>All of this was accomplished by considering <em class="emphasis">before
production</em> the needs of the site's users and fitting
the organization, navigation, labeling, and searching systems around
those needs. What we've covered here is an illustration of what
information architecture is all about.</p>


<p>We don't intend to portray the architecture depicted in this
case study as one-size-fits-all. We feel that it works well as an
external site for a large, distributed institution. There are bits
and pieces of it that you might apply to your situation, but your
site might benefit from a completely different architecture. Your
mileage will certainly vary. But as long as you ask the questions,
plan ahead, and consider the user, your information architecture
should <a name="INDEX-762" />
<a name="INDEX-763" />succeed.<a name="INDEX-764" /></p>
