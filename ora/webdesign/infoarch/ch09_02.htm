<h2 class="sect1">9.2. Content Mapping</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-673" />
<a name="INDEX-674" />During research and conceptual
design, you are focused on the top-down approach of defining an
information structure that will accommodate the mission, vision,
audiences, and content. As you move into production, you complete the
bottom-up process of collecting and analyzing the content. Content
mapping is where top-down meets bottom-up.</p>


<p>The process of content mapping involves breaking down or combining
existing documents into logical content components or
<em class="emphasis">chunks</em>, <a name="INDEX-675" /> <a name="INDEX-676" /> <a name="INDEX-677" /> <a name="INDEX-678" /> <a name="INDEX-679" />thereby separating the content from its
container. A content chunk is not a sentence or a paragraph or a
page. Rather, it is the most finely grained portion of content that
merits or requires individual treatment.</p>


<p>The content, often received from a variety of sources and in a
multitude of formats, must be mapped onto the information
architecture. Because of differences between formats, you cannot
count on a one-to-one mapping of source page to destination page. One
page from a print brochure does not necessarily map onto one page on
the Web. For this reason, it is important to separate content from
container, at both the source and destination. In addition, when
combined with a database-driven approach to content management, the
separation of content and container facilitates the reuse of content
chunks across multiple pages. For example, contact information for
the customer service department might be presented in context within
a variety of pages throughout the web site. If the contact
information changes, modification can be made once to the database
record for that content chunk and then propagated throughout the web
site at the push of a button.</p>


<p>In some cases, you will need to create original content for a web
site. However, content mapping may still be necessary. It often makes
sense to create content in a word processing application rather than
an HTML editor, since tools like Microsoft Word tend to have more
powerful editing, layout, and spell checking capabilities. In such
cases, you'll still need to map the Word documents to HTML
pages.</p>


<p>The subjective process of defining chunks should be determined by
answers to the following questions:</p>


<ul><li><p>Can this document be segmented into multiple chunks that users might
want to access separately?</p></li><li><p>What is the smallest section of content that needs to be individually
indexed?</p></li><li><p>Will this content need to be repurposed across multiple documents or
as part of multiple processes?</p></li></ul>
<p>Once the content chunks have been defined, they can be mapped onto
destination web pages. You will need a systematic means of
documenting the source and destination of all content, so that the
production team can carry out your instructions. As discussed
earlier, one approach involves the assignment of unique
identification codes to each content chunk.<a name="INDEX-680" /> <a name="INDEX-681" /> <a name="INDEX-682" /> <a name="INDEX-683" /> <a name="INDEX-684" /></p>


<p>For example, creation of the SIGGRAPH 96 Conference web site required
the translation of print-based content to the online environment. In
such cases, content mapping involves the specification of how chunks
of content in the print materials map to pages on the web site. For
SIGGRAPH 96, we had to map the contents of elaborately designed
brochures, announcements, and programs onto web pages. It would have
been difficult and silly to attempt a one-to-one mapping of printed
pages to web pages. Therefore, we needed to go through a process of
content chunking and mapping with the content editor. First, we broke
each page of the brochure into logical chunks or atoms of
information. We devised a simple scheme tied to page numbers for
labeling each chunk (see Figures <a href="ch09_02.htm">Figure 9-3</a> and
<a href="ch09_02.htm">Figure 9-4</a>).</p>


<a name="ch09-22785" /><div class="figure"><img height="616" alt="Figure 9-3" src="figs/info_0903.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-3. Print chunks, to be mapped out as shown in <a href="ch09_02.htm">Figure 9-4</a>.</h4>

<p>As you saw in <a href="ch09_01.htm">Figure 9-1</a>, we had already created a
detailed information architecture blueprint with its own content
chunk identification scheme. We then had to create a content mapping
table that explained how each content chunk from the print brochure
should be presented in the web site.</p>


<a name="ch09-32291" /><div class="figure"><img height="345" alt="Figure 9-4" src="figs/info_0904.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-4. In this example, P36-1 refers to the first content chunk on page 36 of the original print brochure (<a href="ch09_02.htm">Figure 9-3</a>). This source content chunk maps onto the destination content chunk labeled 2.2.3, which belongs in the Papers (2.0) area of the web site.</h4>

<p>Armed with the original print documents, architecture blueprints, and
the content mapping table, the production staff created and populated
the SIGGRAPH 96 Conference web site. As you can see in <a href="ch09_02.htm">Figure 9-5</a>, the contents of the web page are quite
different from the original print <a name="INDEX-685" /> <a name="INDEX-686" />page.</p>


<a name="ch09-33240" /><div class="figure"><img height="384" alt="Figure 9-5" src="figs/info_0905.gif" width="463" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-5. Because of the differences between the print and online media, the translation from print brochure to web site involved significant changes. </h4>
