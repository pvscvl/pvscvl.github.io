<h2 class="sect1">5.5. Fine-Tuning the Labeling System</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-362" />The list of terms you are working
with might be raw, coming straight from the content in your site,
your site's users, or your own ideas of what should work best.
Or, it may come straight from a polished controlled vocabulary. In
either case, it'll need some work to become an effective
labeling system.</p>


<a name="ch05-20-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.5.1. The Basics</h3>


<p>First, sort the list of terms alphabetically. If it's a long
list (e.g., indexing labels), you might see some duplicates; remove
these.</p>


<p>Then review the list for consistency of usage, punctuation, letter
case, and so forth. For example, you'll remember that the label
table drawn from the Argus web site had inconsistencies that became
obvious right away. Sometimes we used periods after labels, sometimes
we didn't. We also weren't consistent in our usage of
link labels vs. the heading labels on the pages they referred to.</p>


<p>You might also find that the writing style varies too much from label
to label. For example, one label might use an active verb (e.g.,
Order a Free Sample from Larry's Reptile Hut) while another may
use more passive language (e.g., Larry's Reptile Hut Customer
Service). This is a good time to resolve these inconsistencies and
perhaps to establish conventions for usage in terms of punctuation,
language, and so on.</p>

<a name="INDEX-363" />
<a name="INDEX-364" /> <a name="INDEX-365" />
<a name="INDEX-366" /> <a name="INDEX-367" />Some terms will undoubtedly be
synonyms (e.g., <em class="emphasis">cancer</em> and
<em class="emphasis">oncology</em>), others will be variants on the same
term (e.g., <em class="emphasis">microfiltration systems</em> and
<em class="emphasis">microfiltration services</em>), and some will be
related but not quite the same (e.g., <em class="emphasis">stationery</em>
and <em class="emphasis">letterhead</em>). You'll need to make some
tough decisions here. With synonyms, choose the term that best fits
the language of your site's users. So, if they're medical
professionals, use the medical term <em class="emphasis">oncology</em>
rather than the more generic term <em class="emphasis">cancer</em>. If you
encounter variants or synonyms, ask yourself if they are different or
part of the same general concept. For example, do
<em class="emphasis">microfiltration systems</em> and
<em class="emphasis">microfiltration services</em> need to be
distinguished, or could they be combined under
<em class="emphasis">microfiltration</em>? Do you need very specific terms
like <em class="emphasis">letterhead</em>, or will broader terms like
<em class="emphasis">stationery</em> suffice?</p>


<p>All in all, strive to make your labels descriptive and differentiate
them from one another. The studies by Jared Spool et al. demonstrate
the confusion that can be wrought by putting similar terms such as
<em class="emphasis">global</em> and <em class="emphasis">international</em>
side by side, as was done in the Fidelity web site. If the
site's designers had looked at these labels as part of a
complete system, they'd likely have thought twice about using
such similar labels.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">5.5.2. Labeling System Scope and Size</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-368" />Decisions about which terms to include need
to be made in the context of how broad and how large a labeling
system is required. First, determine if the labeling system has
obvious gaps. Does it encompass all the possibilities that your site
may eventually need to include? If, for example, your site is an
online store that currently allows users to search a product database
but does not support online ordering, ask yourself if eventually it
might. Even if you're not certain, assume it will. Then devise
a label for online ordering that fits within the rest of the labeling
system. Or, if the site's labeling system is topical,
anticipate the topics not yet covered by the site. In both cases, you
might be surprised; you might learn that the addition of these
phantom labels has a large impact on your labeling system, perhaps
sufficiently enough for you to change its conventions in terms of
wording, and so on. If you avoid this exercise, you might learn the
hard way that future content doesn't fit well into your site
because you're not sure how to label it, or it ends up in
cop-out categories such as Miscellaneous, Other Info, and Stuff. Plan
ahead so that labels you might add in the future don't throw
off the current labeling system.</p>


<p>Balance this planning with an understanding of what your labeling
system is there to accomplish. If you try to create a labeling system
that encompasses the whole extent of human knowledge (instead of the
current and anticipated content of your web site), you will encounter
the sorts of nasty problems that the folks who created the
<em class="emphasis">LCSH</em> have discovered. Keep your scope narrow and
focused enough so that it can clearly address the requirements of
your site's unique content and the special needs of its
audiences, but be comprehensive within that well-defined scope.</p>


<p>Also consider the overall size of the labeling system. Obviously, if
the goal is to label a navigation system, five or ten terms may be
all you need. On the other hand, if you're creating a system
for indexing the content of a large site, the labeling system may
include hundreds of terms. What you'll want is the right level
of
<em class="emphasis">granularity</em>
<a name="INDEX-369" /> for your labeling system. Granularity,
as mentioned before, refers to how specific you want to be in
identifying and labeling your site's content. If you have ten
thousand documents, can you use a labeling system of ten terms to
label them? Sure, but under each label, you'd find hugely long
and unusable lists of documents. On the other hand, if you use a
three-tiered labeling system with hundreds of terms, users might shy
away from its complexity. Is there a middle ground that makes sense
in terms of labeling system size, a solution large enough to
appropriately label the content, but not too overwhelming for users?
If not, you might have to adjust the granularity that your labeling
system is addressing. Perhaps instead of attempting to label every
document, you'll have to address a coarser level of granularity
by labeling logical groupings of documents (e.g., all the documents
from the same department or by the same author) instead of each
individual document. <a name="INDEX-370" /></p>
