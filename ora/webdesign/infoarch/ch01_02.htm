<h2 class="sect1">1.2. If You Don't Like to Exercise...</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-6" /> <a name="INDEX-7" />Maybe you don't really want to
go to Consumer Sensitivity Boot Camp. So we've decided to give
you a break and share with you the types of likes and dislikes we
often hear from our own clients and colleagues, sprinkled liberally
with our own biases.</p>


<a name="ch01-3-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.1. What Do You Hate About the Web?</h3>


<p>We found that compiling this list was quick work, as we see these
design sins every day, and have committed quite a few over the years
ourselves.</p>


<a name="ch01-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.1.1. Can't find it</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-8" /> <a name="INDEX-9" /> <a name="INDEX-10" />You
know great information is available in a certain web site. At least,
that's what you've heard, but every time you look for it,
you can't find it. Maybe you were even bounced out of the site
altogether through some external link. Sites like these often provide
no index, table of contents, or site map, and no search facility.
Even worse, the labels they use for their information are obscure;
they may mean something to someone else, but not to you. Another
problem can be when the content is moved around repeatedly, so that
something here today is gone tomorrow.</p>


<p>Even when users aren't looking for particular information
within a site, they can often be befuddled by a poor navigation
system. A common example of this phenomenon is navigational headers
and footers that are inconsistent from page to page. Another example:
backgrounds and color schemes that radically change from page to page
within the same site. Users may wonder if they are even using the
same site at all.<a name="INDEX-11" /> <a name="INDEX-12" /></p>
</div>



<a name="ch01-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.1.2. Poor graphic design and layout</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-13" />
<a name="INDEX-14" />It's becoming almost pass&eacute; to
complain about web sites with huge image files that take a long time
to download, but people tend to hate a host of other graphic
design-related problems. Pages crowded with text, links, graphics,
and other components make it harder for users to find information on
those pages. Many designers forget that white space is as important a
component of a page as anything else. Crowding results in long pages
that require scrolling to get to important items.</p>


<p>Paradoxically, people also complain about graphic design on the Web
being both dull and excessive. We've all yawned our way through
long pages of text after text after text, without a break for the
eye, all against the backdrop of a dismal gray background.
We've also encountered high-octane graphics with loudly
crashing colors that make our eyes burn, or purposely minimalist
designs that sacrifice usability for a bizarre sense of aesthetics
(e.g., using the same colors for both links and unlinked text).</p>


<p>A large part of the problem, of course, is that graphic design is a
profession whose mastery requires more than just picking up a copy of
Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator and the URL for a clip art archive.
Effective graphic designers step back and think about the objectives
of the site, its sponsor, and the particular challenges of their
project before plunging in. Also, good graphic designers don't
tend to see every project as an opportunity to exclusively showcase
their own work. Like it or not, the Web doesn't require us to
have MFAs to design graphics for our sites.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch01-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.1.3. Gratuitous use of bells and whistles</h3>


<p>Technology is great: it allows us to do so many neat things!
It's often hard to resist showing all the neat things we can do
with web technologies. Wonderful things, from trite counters to
moderately annoying, revolving "NEW!" animated GIFs to
frustrating frames to the Java applets that, after taking eons to
download, don't add any functionality.</p>


<p>This may seem to be a very Luddite perspective, but, like graphics
and other aspects of web site design, technologies should directly
aid users in getting what they want out of a site. There
shouldn't be any unnecessary bells and whistles. If the desired
effect of the technology is to attract and captivate the user, then
it must be very carefully applied; unless the technical designer is
quite talented, the user will have likely seen it before and seen it
done better.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch01-7-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.1.4. Inappropriate tone</h3>


<p>An interesting aspect of designing user interfaces for
<em class="emphasis">any</em> medium, Web or otherwise, is deciding what
you can expect from the user. If a site is designed to speak one
language (e.g., it makes liberal use of organizational jargon) and
the user speaks another (e.g., he or she is a medical professional
who is used to communicating with scientific terms), who should make
the effort to learn the other's language? It's generally
assumed that the burden is on the site and its designer to
communicate in the language of the user, and not vice versa. In the
heat of the moment, it's very easy to forget about the audience
and instead concentrate on self-expression, technological options, or
some other distraction from user-centered design. The result is a
site that doesn't speak to the user, but forces the user to try
to get inside the mind of the site's copyeditor.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch01-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.1.5. Designer-centeredness</h3>


<p>There's nothing wrong with self-expression, but most large,
complex web sites aren't geared toward the self; the huge
investment made in them requires that they be designed for use by
many people. Yet we've all encountered sites ostensibly set up
for companies that are little more than avenues for webmaster
self-expression, including such oldies as lists of "my favorite
links" and an image of said page designer. There is an ongoing
debate at many companies as to whether or not to allow their
employees to maintain their own personal information on the Web;
keeping that stuff off the official web site seems to be a good
practice.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch01-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.1.6. Under construction</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-15" />We always encounter sites that
are under construction. In fact, sometimes they seem to have been
abandoned. If a site's content and functionality don't
merit launching, then why launch it? If it has already launched,
it's generally understood that no site is ever really finished.
Users would probably prefer to know nothing of far-down-the-road
changes than see an under construction graphic or read a note
explaining what's happening, why it's taking so long, or
whose fault it is.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch01-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.1.7. Lack of attention to detail</h3>


<p>Then there are sites full of haphazard information, rife with typos,
broken links, out-of-date content, factual errors, or poorly executed
HTML. A lack of proofreading, link checking, HTML validation, and, in
general, any attention to detail demonstrates a lack of
professionalism and sensitivity to the user.</p>
</div>
</div>




<a name="ch01-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.2. What Do You Like About the Web?</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-16" />This section is
considerably shorter than its predecessor. Does this mean that there
is less to like about the Web than there is to hate? Not at all. It
means that, as with anything else, we take success for granted. While
poor design actively frustrates and angers us, quality is quiet,
passive, and often transparent. Whether we're discussing
everyday things such as door knobs and keyboards, or the look and
feel of a web site, we generally take note only when things
don't work. You will notice, however, that the sites we love
all share the same characteristic: they integrate each of the key
aspects of web site design: information architecture, technical
design, and graphic design. Later we'll discuss many quiet
techniques to aid in web site design and development, but for the
time being, let's stay in web consumer mode.</p>


<a name="ch01-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.2.1. Aesthetics</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-17" />
<a name="INDEX-18" />Superficial
though it may seem, we use and enjoy some sites simply because they
are aesthetically pleasing. However, it is rarely because they simply
contain the most pleasing graphics. An attractive site is
distinguished by a cohesive and consistent look that presents a
unique identity for the site and, ideally, for its sponsors. These
sites' graphics and page layouts are integrated with their
other features, such as navigation systems, custom applications,
editorial style, and so forth. Therefore, the user doesn't
notice the individual images so much as he or she enjoys the overall
atmosphere and experience created by the site. Behind such sites
stand graphic designers for whom design is about the whole page, not
just the images (just as information architects concentrate on the
whole site, not just pages). The intangible qualities of this type of
site are its consistent and functional graphic elements, as well as
its integration of page layout and graphic elements.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch01-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.2.2. Big ideas</h3>


<p>Some sites are thought provoking: they present ideas that may change
the way you look at things. The copy in these sites may be written in
styles that are reminiscent of mystery novels, gossip, manifestoes,
poetry, or Sunday morning political discourse. You might completely
forget that you are using the Web. Great writing and intelligent page
layout aren't what's obvious about these sites; their
ideas are. The intangible qualities of this type of site are its
quality writing, copyediting, and overall ability to communicate
ideas effectively.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch01-14-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.2.3. Utility</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-19" /> <a name="INDEX-20" />Above all, we
visit and return to a web site because we find it useful in some way.
Ideally, all sites incorporate special technologies seamlessly, but
some have no choice: their end-all and be-all is to serve you some
nifty application. Search engine sites, for example, are more engine
and less web site. Or with Web-based games, the HTML files are really
quite secondary. You don't go to any of these places because
they are web sites. You go to them to do research, keep up with the
news, or have fun. For that matter, you won't go to them if
they don't function well. Can you imagine if AltaVista were
down for an afternoon? The intangible quality of this type of site is
that its applications work well and match the site's goals, or
perhaps <em class="emphasis">are</em> the site's goals.<a name="INDEX-21" /></p>
</div>



<a name="ch01-15-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.2.4. "Findability"</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-22" /> <a name="INDEX-23" />While one of the most painful
parts of using the Web is trying to find something on a bad site, a
real joy can come from a site that makes it easy to find its useful
content. Sites that use well-planned information architectures are as
magical as the phenomenon of the Internet itself: both are incredibly
effective at the tricky task of routing users and packets
respectively. Strong information architectures are especially
important for large web sites: to unlock the power found in those
huge volumes of content, these sites need navigation systems and
organizational schemes that feature the information that people need
to know and hide the stuff that would otherwise get in the way. The
intangible qualities of this type of site are organization,
navigational ease, and the fact that the site doesn't get
between the users and the information they need.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch01-16-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.2.5. Personalization</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-24" />
<a name="INDEX-25" />Users increasingly demand from web sites
the ability to get information that is customized to their interests
and needs. Many web sites now tailor their content through the use of
architectures designed to support multiple audience types, or through
technologies that allow users to profile their personal interests.
These kinds of sites demonstrate that their designers are sensitive
to the fact the users aren't all the same. Besides the
influence of users, marketing efforts have driven this trend to a
large degree: why present general information to the broadest
audience (e.g., trying to sell tobacco products to everyone,
including the anti-smoking activists) when you can target information
to prequalified market segments (e.g., selling expensive cigars to
yuppies)? The intangible quality of this type of site is that its
designers realize that users are different, and make provisions to
address their unique needs.<a name="INDEX-26" /> <a name="INDEX-27" /></p>
</div>
</div>




<a name="ch01-17-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.3. A Last Word About Consumers</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-28" />Web consumers have an almost mythically
short attention span. No medium compares. When visiting a new site,
users often give up on it <em class="emphasis">before</em> its main page
has fully downloaded. Sure, cable TV watchers can surf channels
rapid-fire, but few systems carry more than 60 or 70 channels. The
Web, on the other hand, has hundreds of thousands of
"channels" only a click away.</p>


<p>Considering the challenge of designing sites that users love while
also accommodating their microscopic attention spans, it may seem
that the web site designer has a snowball's chance in hell of
succeeding. However, if completing our Boot Camp exercise
doesn't make the prospective web site designer at least a
little uncomfortable, then there is an even bigger reason to worry.
Besides producing a useful list of likes and dislikes, this exercise
should strike some fear into the hearts of all web site designers. It
should now be apparent that, regardless of how low the barrier of
entry is for writing HTML pages, designing successful sites is an
incredible challenge.<a name="INDEX-29" /></p>


<p>Completing the Boot Camp exercise makes you a more advanced web site
consumer. It may force you to take a thoughtful step back before
diving into the inviting but treacherous pool of web site design. As
you jump in, your next step will be to decompose the huge problems
discussed here into something more manageable. You'll do this
by asking important questions, such as:</p>


<ul><li><p>What is it that we are designing, and why?</p></li><li><p>Who will use it?</p></li><li><p>How will we know if we've been successful?</p></li></ul>
<p>Helping you answer those questions is the purpose of this book.</p>
