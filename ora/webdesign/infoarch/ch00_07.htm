<h2 class="sect1">0.7. Acknowledgments</h2>


<p>Acknowledgments are both the most enjoyable and most treacherous part
of writing a book. It's a wonderful feeling to reach the point
where thanks are in order and to recognize the many people who
participated in the experience, directly or indirectly. Yet
it's awfully frightening to consider the strong possibility
that we've left someone out. So we'd like to offer our
apologies to anyone we have forgotten, and thank the rest:</p>


<p>Linda Mui and the rest of the editorial staff for their availability,
high standards, and professionalism. The production team, which
included Jane Ellin, the production editor; Mike Sierra, who
converted the book and provided Tools support; Seth Maislin, the
indexer; Robert Romano, the illustrator; Nancy Priest, the interior
designer; Edie Freedman, who designed the cover; Elissa Haney and
Claire Cloutier LeBlanc for production support; and Madeleine Newell,
Nicole Gipson Arigo, Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary, and Sheryl
Avruch for quality control. We now know firsthand why O'Reilly
&amp; Associates enjoys its reputation.</p>


<p>Lorrie LeJeune, O'Reilly's Product Marketing Manager, who
got us into this mess in the first place, but kept prodding
good-naturedly throughout the process. Without her this book would
never have been written.</p>


<p>O'Reilly &amp; Associates, for its willingness to delve into
the risky waters of publishing a book on the slippery topic of
information architecture. We also really appreciated the free books
and tee shirts.</p>


<p>Our reviewers, Steve Champeon, Jennifer Fleming, Andrew Gent, David
Golumbia, Peter Mahnke, Paul Morville, Jeff Stuit, and Roy Tennant.
It was our dumb luck that such a cast was available and willing to
provide us with their expert feedback.</p>


<p>The sponsors of the many sites profiled in this book. We greatly
appreciate their granting permission to allow us to use images of
their sites to give information architecture a more tangible
treatment.</p>


<p>Our colleagues at Argus Associates, Samantha Bailey, Stephen Toub,
and Christopher Farnum. They read our drafts, gave us critical
feedback and ideas, kept the Argus ship afloat, humored us, and put
up with our crankiness while we worked on this book.</p>


<p>Our colleagues at Allied Studios, who have taught us volumes about
interdisciplinary design and teamwork: John Bidwell, Jeff Callender,
Hans Masing, Tom Rieke, Peter Wyngaard, and all the other creative
people at Q LTD and InterConnect of Ann Arbor.</p>


<p>Our teachers and mentors from the University of Michigan's
School of Information: Dan Atkins, David Blair, Michael Cohen, David
Hessler, Maurita Holland, Joe Janes, Dave Rodgers, Victor Rosenberg,
Amy Warner, and the late Miranda Pao.</p>


<p>Our friends in the Internet and library communities for their good
works and generous help: Scott Brylow, Abbot Chambers, Larry Coppard,
John December, Andrea Gallagher, Tony Grant, Charles Harmon, Randy
Horton, Keith Instone, Jakob Nielsen, Anna Noakes, Pat Schuman, Phil
Sutherland, Heidi Weise, Ed Vielmetti, and Rich Wiggins.</p>


<p>Finally, we'd like to say a special thanks to our families for
their love and support, and to our respective partners, Mary Jean
Babic and Susan Joanne Morville, who put up with us during the whole
ordeal. Thanks to all!</p>
