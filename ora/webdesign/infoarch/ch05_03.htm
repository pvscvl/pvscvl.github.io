<h2 class="sect1">5.3. Types of Labeling Systems</h2>


<p>In web sites, labels come in two formats, textual and iconic. We
typically find them used in two ways: as links to chunks of
information on other pages (usually within the context of navigation
systems, as index terms, or as labels for links), and as headings
that break up and identify the chunks of information on the same page
(much like the heading on this printed page). Of course, a single
label can do double duty; for example, the link Contact Us could lead
to a page that uses the title label Contact Us.</p>


<a name="ch05-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.1. Labels Within Navigation Systems</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-307" />
<a name="INDEX-308" />Navigation system labels demand
consistent application more than any other type of labeling system.
Navigation systems, as we described in <a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "Designing Navigation Systems"</a>,
occur again and again within a web site. Just as users rely on
navigational systems to be positioned on a page consistently and look
the same throughout the site, they rely on their labels to work in a
consistent, familiar way, as in <a href="ch05_03.htm">Figure 5-1</a>.
Effectively applied labels are integral to building this sense of
familiarity, so they'd better not change from page to page.
That's why using the label Main, on one page, Main Page on
another, and Home elsewhere will surely destroy the familiarity that
the user needs when navigating a site.</p>


<a name="ch05-42049" /><div class="figure"><img height="370" alt="Figure 5-1" src="figs/info_0501.gif" width="500" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-1. The labels Interact, View, Browse, and Search are part of a site-wide navigation system. This labeling system uses consistent verb-based terminology.</h4>

<p>Some conventions have emerged for navigation system labels. You
should consider using these, as they are already familiar to most web
users. Here is a non-exhaustive list:</p>


<ul><li><p>Main, Main Page, Home, Home Page</p></li><li><p>Search, Find, Browse, Search/Browse, Site Map, Contents, Table of
Contents, Index</p></li><li><p>Contact , Contact Us, Contact Webmaster, Feedback</p></li><li><p>Help, FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions</p></li><li><p>News, What's New</p></li><li><p>About, About Us, About &lt;company name&gt;, Who We Are</p></li></ul>
<p>However, each example has two or more textual variants used to
represent the same information. So these conventions aren't
completely conventional; use them with care! At least use them
consistently within your site, as in the example in <a href="ch05_03.htm">Figure 5-1</a>.</p>


<p>Conversely, the same label can often represent different kinds of
information. For example, in one site News may link to an area in a
site that includes announcements of new additions to the site. In
another site News may link to an area of news stories describing
national and world events. Obviously, if you use the same labels in
different ways <em class="emphasis">within</em> your own site, your users
will be very confused.</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-309" /> <a name="INDEX-310" />To address both problems, navigational
labels can be augmented by brief descriptions (also known as
<em class="emphasis">scope notes</em>) when initially introduced. For
example, when a user first encounters these navigational labels on a
site's main page, he or she will get a sense of their meaning
from their accompanying descriptions:</p>


<a name="ch05-7-fm2xml" /><table border="1">



<tr>
<th>
<p>Label</p></th>
<th>
<p>Scope Note</p></th>
</tr>




<tr>
<td>
<p>Search/Browse</p></td>
<td>
<p>Search this site by entering a query, or browse it via a
comprehensive site map.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Contact Us</p></td>
<td>
<p>A direct line to our customer service department, with a 24-hour
turn-around guaranteed.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

<td>
<p>Keep current with our up-to-the-minute stock prices and press
releases.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Help</p></td>
<td>
<p>Our site's FAQ, and how to contact our webmaster.</p></td>
</tr>


</table>

<p>After this initial introduction, the user should easily understand
how to use the following navigation bar that appears on all the other
pages in the site:</p>


<blockquote class="simplelist">

<p>Search/Browse | Contact Us | News | Help</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The labels are now familiar, and if used consistently, will work
effectively. Usability tests run on many major sites have confirmed
the contextual value of providing descriptions.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-12">[12]</a> The Argus Clearinghouse provides a more
extensive example of the use of scope notes<a name="INDEX-311" /> <a name="INDEX-312" /> (<a href="ch05_03.htm">Figure 5-2</a>).</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="ch05-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.2. Labels as Indexing Terms</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-313" />
<a name="INDEX-314" />Labels are increasingly used as
indexing terms for classifying the contents of large sites. They work
in two ways: enhancing a document's chance of getting retrieved
by a searching system, and supporting browsing within a site.</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-315" />
<a name="INDEX-316" /> <a name="INDEX-317" />To support searching, keywords are
assigned to a document, whether within the &lt;META&gt; tag or in an
accompanying database record that describes the document's
contents. These labels are usually heard but not seen; in other
words, they aren't necessarily visible to the user, but instead
work in the background to ensure a search engine appropriately
indexes the document. For example, we inserted the following code in
the main page for International Furniture Rentals
(<em class="emphasis">http://www.rent-ifr.com</em>):</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;META name="keywords" content="IFR Furniture Rentals, International 
Furniture Rentals, IFR Rentals, relocation, furniture rental, furniture 
leasing, interim housing, furnished apartments, executive suites, 
residential furniture, office furniture"&gt;</pre></blockquote>


<p>These indexing terms are keywords that describe the company's
services and locations, as well as synonyms and name variants (e.g.,
IFR Rentals) that we anticipated might be searched by users. Search
engines, whether Web-wide (e.g., Alta Vista, Hotbot) or specific to
this site would then include these terms in their indexes, thereby
improving user searching.</p>


<p>Indexing labels effectively within a page's <a name="INDEX-318" />&lt;TITLE&gt; tags can similarly improve a
searcher's chances of retrieving the right pages in your site.
In fact, we've found that Web-wide search engine relevance
ranking algorithms seem to consider terms in a document's
&lt;TITLE&gt; as very indicative of the document's content, and
so these documents often end up ranked quite highly on result lists.
In our own site, we included these descriptive labels within the
&lt;TITLE&gt; tags:</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;TITLE&gt;Argus Associates. information architecture design, organization, 
labeling, navigation, searching, indexing, intranets, Web sites&lt;/TITLE&gt;</pre></blockquote>


<p>It's surprising that labels as indexing terms are not used
more. Site sponsors do crazy things to get their sites noticed,
including advertising their URL on banners flown over football
stadiums, but they don't always bother to insert accurate,
descriptive terms in their site's pages.</p>


<p>Besides enhancing searching, index labels can also improve browsing.
By using keywords to manually index a site's content, you can
provide additional means for accessing its content <em class="emphasis">beyond
its main organization scheme</em>. For example, the Henry Ford
Health System's site (shown in <a href="ch05_03.htm">Figure 5-3</a>)
contains many records for each department, division, hospital,
program, and so on. Because those are the major entities of the
health system, they constitute the main organization system for that
content. However, we also added topical keywords to each record
(e.g., heart, kidney, liver, lung, skin graft, and transplantation)
to allow users to access the site's content by topic. This
approach allows users to cut across the grain of the site's
main organization system and browse the content in a completely
different <a name="INDEX-319" />
<a name="INDEX-320" />mode.</p>


<a name="ch05-27848" /><div class="figure"><img height="350" alt="Figure 5-3" src="figs/info_0503.gif" width="455" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-3. Content already accessible through a major organization system (e.g., organizational designations such as Departments &amp; Divisions) can also be made accessible by indexing terms (e.g., keywords). In this case, each keyword serves as a link, allowing users to access other content indexed under the same keyword.</h4>
</div>




<a name="ch05-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.3. Link Labels</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-321" /> <a name="INDEX-322" /> <a name="INDEX-323" /> <a name="INDEX-324" />Labels are also used as textual
links within the body or text of a chunk of information. These
aren't as difficult to create because, unlike navigation system
labels, they are naturally used in the descriptive context of their
surrounding text. See <a href="ch05_03.htm">Figure 5-4</a> for an example of
link labels.</p>


<a name="ch05-27665" /><div class="figure"><img height="192" alt="Figure 5-4" src="figs/info_0504.gif" width="457" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-4. In this example, the link labels are services, houses, directory, and added. When people describe hypertext, they're often thinking of link labels.</h4>

<p>Just because they're relatively easy to create doesn't
mean they necessarily work well. For example, take the following list
of link labels:</p>


<blockquote class="simplelist">

<p>Amalgamated</p>

<p>annual report</p>

<p>Bob Pobjoy</p>

<p>ButtMaster 5000</p>

<p>forty percent</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Here, we have no clue what these labels mean because there is no
context. Without context, these aren't part of a system at all.
Certainly, if they were being used as part of a navigation system,
they'd never work.</p>


<p>However, as we see these labels as links within the context of the
text, they start to make sense:</p>



<blockquote>...<u class="emphasis-underline">Amalgamated</u> employees believe
in the products that they manufacture, market, and sell. For example,
<u class="emphasis-underline">forty percent</u> of the company's
employees religiously work out on Amalgamated's <u class="emphasis-underline">ButtMaster 5000</u> at least once per work
day. According to <u class="emphasis-underline">Bob Pobjoy</u> ,
Amalgamated's Chief Morale Officer, "It's a great stress reducer,
healthful, and good clean fun. And if you read our <u class="emphasis-underline">annual report</u> , you'll know that Amalgamated is
firmly behind firm behinds" quips Pobjoy....</blockquote>



<p>Systematic consistency isn't an issue for link labels. These
labels are glued together by the copy, not by a particular system.
However, consistency does become an issue between these labels and
the chunks of information they link to.</p>


<p>For example, the link "annual report" may take the user
to a page with the heading Financial Information.
<em class="emphasis">Most</em> users won't have a problem with this,
but at least a few will be confused. But if the link
"Amalgamated" leads to a page labeled Acme Corporation,
most users won't bother reading the copy far enough to learn
that Amalgamated is really a division of Acme.</p>


<p>Avoiding the problems associated with inconsistencies between link
labels and where they lead is difficult. We'll never be
certain, for example, what we get if we select the link "Bob
Pobjoy." A biography? A photo? A personal home page? A mailto:?
An entry in a corporate directory? Will "forty percent"
lead to a simple pie chart, or the results of a rigorous scientific
study of Amalgamated employee exercise habits? These problems can be
minimized by asking yourself, "What kind of information will
the user expect to be taken to?" <em class="emphasis">before
</em>creating and labeling a link. Then, apply your answer
consistently. For example, consider having all references to personal
names (e.g., Bob Pobjoy) lead to the same sort of destination (e.g.,
always to a mailto: link).</p>


<p>A note of caution about link labels: links embedded in text can be
difficult for the eye to scan. They are fine for ad hoc links that
cannot be easily separated from surrounding text, but don't
rely on them for frequently used links such as navigational links.

<a name="ch05-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.4. Labels as Headings</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-329" /> <a name="INDEX-330" />Links are often
used as headings that describe the chunk of information that follows
the heading. For example, the label for this part of the page you are
reading, "Labels as Headings," represents the chunk of
information between it and the next heading, "Iconic Labeling
Systems." To some degree, a heading label, like a link label,
also relies on the text that follows to convey its meaning (see <a href="ch05_03.htm">Figure 5-5</a>). However, unlike link labels, there is no
guarantee that the user will read the associated chunk of text. So
there is extreme pressure on heading labels to draw the user's
attention to the accompanying chunk of information.</p>


<a name="ch05-36107" /><div class="figure"><img height="411" alt="Figure 5-5" src="figs/info_0505.gif" width="500" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-5. The obvious heading labels here are Submit a Guide, Comments &amp; Suggestions, and Opportunities. These were designed so that users could understand what the labels represent without reading the actual copy. Navigation and Contact Information could also be considered heading labels, in this case for broader areas.</h4>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-331" /> <a name="INDEX-332" />To ensure that your heading labels
work well as a system, display the heading labels from each page in
your site as a single outline. Look for two characteristics:
<em class="emphasis">consistency in terminology</em> and
<em class="emphasis">consistency in granularity</em>. Consistent
terminology means that the wording used among labels is uniform and
cohesive. Consistent granularity means two things: 1) that the chunks
of information represented at each level of labels are roughly of
equal importance, and 2) that the levels of labels don't vary
greatly in how deeply they cover parts of a site.</p>


<p>In the following example, we see the outlines for a site's main
page and two of its component pages:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Heading Labels from Main Page</b></dt>
<dd><blockquote><pre class="code">GPSC: Global Psychic Services Corporation
    Call our Telephone Hotline
    GPSC Publications for Sale
    For Prospective Employees
    Search This Site
    Questions/Feedback</pre></blockquote></dd>


<dt><b>Heading Labels from "GPSC Publications for Sale" Page #1</b></dt>
<dd><blockquote><pre class="code">GPSC Publications for Sale: <em class="replaceable">The Bon Vivant's Guide to Nouvelle Psychic	                                Cooking</em>
    What is "Psychic Cooking"?
    Synopsis
    About the Author
    What People are Saying About <em class="replaceable">The Bon Vivant's Guide to Nouvelle Psychic</em>
<em class="replaceable">                                    Cooking</em>
          Testimonials
          Reviews
Ordering Information
          By Fax
          By Telephone
          Via the Internet</pre></blockquote></dd>



<dt><b>Heading Labels from "GPSC Publications for Sale" Page #2</b></dt>
<dd><blockquote><pre class="code">Publications for Sale-"Your Psychic Pet"
How to Order This Book</pre></blockquote></dd>

</dl>

<p>The main page's problems with consistent terminology are due to
a poor organization system. These labels are a mix of tasks (e.g.,
Call our Telephone Hotline, Search This Site), audiences (e.g., For
Prospective Employees), and general topics (e.g., GPSC Publications
for Sale, Questions/Feedback). Because the organization system is
poorly designed, the labels that represent it are confusing.</p>


<p>The two GPSC Publications for Sale pages have inconsistent labels for
the main heading and the ordering information:</p>



<blockquote><p>GPSC Publications for Sale: <em class="emphasis">The Bon Vivant's Guide to
Nouvelle Psychic Cooking</em> vs. Publications for
Sale-"Living with Psychic Pets"</p>


<p>Ordering Information vs. How to Order This Book</blockquote>



<p>One echoes the original heading on the main page, while the other
omits the GPSC. One uses a colon, the other a dash to separate the
generic label from the publication's title. One uses italics,
while the other encloses the title in quotation marks. Also, these
two pages have radically different sets of headings for no
particularly good reason. Mightn't users also want a synopsis
and author information for Your Psychic Pet?</p>


<p>Lastly, the first publication's page goes into much more detail
than the second. The first has a much finer level of granularity than
does the second. For example, on Page #1, there are heading labels
for ordering By Fax, By Telephone, and Via the Internet, but on Page
#2 the granularity is coarser: we only know How to Order This Book
without mention of how it can be ordered. Is there any good reason
for this? This sort of problem is caused by carelessness or, in other
words, lack of planning.<a name="INDEX-333" /> <a name="INDEX-334" /></p>

<a name="ch05-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.5. Iconic Labeling Systems</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-335" /> <a name="INDEX-336" />It's true that a picture is
worth a thousand words. But <em class="emphasis">which</em> thousand?</p>


<p>Icons can represent information in much the same way as text. We see
them frequently used as navigation labels. Additionally, icons
occasionally serve as heading labels and have even been known to show
up as link labels, although this is rare.</p>


<p>The problem with iconic labels is that they constitute a much more
limited language than text. Consider the concept <em class="emphasis">home
page</em>. You'll find that there are icons that are
commonly recognized as representing home pages. Here are a few
examples:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-13">[13]</a></p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-13" /><p>[13]These icons come from IconBAZAAR
(<a href="../../../../../../www.iconbazaar.com/">http://www.iconbazaar.com/</a>).</p>

</blockquote>


<p><img height="25" alt="Figure 5.3.5" src="figs/home1.icon.gif" width="25" /></p>

<p><img height="32" alt="Figure 5.3.5" src="figs/home2.icon.gif" width="32" /></p>

<p><img height="32" alt="Figure 5.3.5" src="figs/home3.icon.gif" width="32" /></p>


<p>But what about when you want to represent something more complex?
Like, for instance, a link to Press Releases? You may have
occasionally seen a newspaper or cascaded trio of icons, like these:</p>


<p><img height="28" alt="Figure 5.3.5" src="figs/news1.icon.gif" width="34" /></p>

<p><img height="34" alt="Figure 5.3.5" src="figs/news2.icon.gif" width="30" /></p>

<p><img height="32" alt="Figure 5.3.5" src="figs/news3.icon.gif" width="34" /></p>


<p>Does it work? Would you automatically know that these icons represent
press releases? Or would you have guessed that it represents a
report? Or something that's already in print? Or something else
altogether?</p>


<p>English has over 610,000 words.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-14">[14]</a> Remarkably, English speakers have
generally agreed to certain conventions about its syntax and
semantics. In other words, there isn't much doubt what is meant
by the textual label Main Page.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-14" /><p>[14]According to Nettie
Lagace, Reference Librarian at the Internet Public Library
(<a href="../../../../../../www.ipl.org/">http://www.ipl.org</a>), "If you take the

<p>Iconic languages, however, are a bit more constrained. Because
we're not all artistic, it's harder to convey a concept
visually than it is in text (see <a href="ch05_03.htm">Figure 5-6</a>). For
example, if I drew an image of a house for use as a main page icon,
it's as likely that you'd interpret my drawing as
representing a home page as you'd interpret it as a dog chasing
its tail.</p>


<a name="ch05-22515" /><div class="figure"><img height="411" alt="Figure 5-6" src="figs/info_0506.gif" width="463" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-6. Jakob Nielsen of Sun Microsystems and Darrell Sano of Netscape Communica-tions conducted an interesting study of how users interpreted the icons Sun was considering using on its intranet. Our favorite results: the icon for "Benefits" interpreted as "Clinton's health plan," the icon for "What's New" interpreted as "Laundry," and the icon for "World Wide Web" interpreted as "dimensions of the planet." </h4>

<p>Even more than text labels, iconic labels rely on consistent
positioning on a site's pages. Moving them around from page to
page can sacrifice the user's ability to scan the page quickly
and understand what the labels represent, thereby negating much of
the benefit of using iconic labels.</p>


<p>Icons are fine for representing a few key concepts in a web site.
We've all seen a few conventions, such as a house icon for a
main page, a question mark for a help page, a magnifying glass for a
search page, and so forth. But there aren't too many more that
conform to convention, so using icons to represent a large, complex
site is an approach that won't scale well. How large is the
language of standard web icons? A dozen, perhaps? Certainly no
comparison to its textual counterpart, English. In fact, you'll
notice that very few web sites bother to use iconic labels
<em class="emphasis">without</em> accompanying textual labels, if they use
icons at all.</p>


<p>So why use iconic labels, especially if you can't use them
without textual labels? Two reasons: 1) they can contribute to a
consistent, attractive graphic identity for a site, and 2) they are
familiar and easy for the user to find on a page (<em class="emphasis">if
</em>they are drawn from the small group of concepts
conventionally understood and are used consistently on all the
site's pages).<a name="INDEX-337" /> <a name="INDEX-338" /></p>
