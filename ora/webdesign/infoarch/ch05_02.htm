<h2 class="sect1">5.2. Labeling Systems, Not Labels</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-305" />It's important to remember that
labels, like organization and navigation systems, are systems in
their own right. So it follows that labeling systems, like any other,
require planning to succeed. To illustrate, let's compare two
labeling systems:</p>


<ol><li><p>Unplanned Labeling System</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Faculty Skunkworks
Office for Instructional Technology 
K12 PDN Projects Web Page
Digital Libraries Project
Office of Technology Management
Extension Services
The New Media Center
Project 1999
Institute for Information Technology
English Composition Board
Technology Dissemination Office</pre></blockquote></li><li><p>Planned Labeling System</p>


<blockquote><pre class="code">Arts &amp; Humanities
Business &amp; Employment
Communication
Computers &amp; Information Technology
Education
Engineering
Environment
Government &amp; Law
Health &amp; Medicine
Places &amp; Peoples
Recreation
Science &amp; Mathematics
Social Sciences &amp; Social Issues</pre></blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>What is the difference between these two labeling systems?</p>


<p>If you were a first-time visitor, you'd have little sense of
what the labels in the Unplanned System represent. They were created
with the assumption that users would know these programs and
acronyms. We can assume that this site deals with something academic,
because of the labels Faculty, English Composition, and so forth. The
list does seem somewhat consistent, as it includes many terms that
seem to represent organizational units, such as Office, Services,
Board, Project, and Institute. However, some terms are confounding,
such as K12 PDN Web Page, Project 1999, Faculty Skunkworks, and The
New Media Center. It's not clear if these represent web sites,
organizational units, or something else altogether. So we scratch our
heads and wonder what this is all about.</p>


<p>The Planned System, without context, might also make us wonder. What
resources do these subjects cover? But at least we're clear
that these indeed are subject areas. Also, the lack of exceptions
indicates comprehensiveness: each is a subject area, so all possible
subjects must be covered here. This is a useful trick: although there
is no proof that this list is indeed comprehensive, users will often
assume that consistent, systematic labeling systems do in fact cover
the full extent of the domain that they represent. Most importantly,
users have seen this type of system before, so the user only needs to
learn the <em class="emphasis">labeling system</em>, not each individual
label. After one quick look, the user understands how this system
works: it's subject-oriented. Consistency breeds familiarity,
and familiarity breeds content(ment).<a name="INDEX-306" /></p>
