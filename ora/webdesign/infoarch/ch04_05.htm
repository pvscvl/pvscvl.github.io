<h2 class="sect1">4.5. Integrated Navigation Elements</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-237" /> <a name="INDEX-238" />In global and local navigation systems,
the most common and important navigation elements are those that are
integrated into the content-bearing pages of the web site. As users
move through the site or sub-site, these are the elements they see
and use again and again. Most integrated navigation elements fit into
one of two categories: navigation bars and pull-down menus.</p>


<a name="ch04-8-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.5.1. Navigation Bars</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-239" />You can implement navigation bars in many
ways and use them for the hierarchical, global, and local navigation
systems. In simplest form, a <a name="INDEX-240" />
<a name="INDEX-241" />navigation bar is a collection of
hypertext links grouped together on a page. Alternatively, the
navigation bar may be graphical in nature, implemented as an image
map or as graphic images within a table structure.</p>


<p>The decision to use text versus <a name="INDEX-242" />graphic navigation bars falls primarily
within the realms of graphic design and technical performance rather
than information architecture. Graphic navigation bars tend to look
nicer but can significantly slow down the page loading speed
(although, if you're able to reuse the same global navigation
bar throughout the site, loading speed will only be hurt once, since
the image will be cached locally). If you do use graphic navigation
bars, you need to be sensitive to the needs of users with low
bandwidth connections. You should also consider those users with
text-only browsers (there are still quite a few out there) and those
users with high-end browsers who turn off the graphical capabilities
to get around more quickly. Appropriate use of the &lt;ALT&gt;
attribute to define replacement text for the image will ensure that
your site supports navigation for these users.</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-243" />However, key issues related to the
architecture should also influence this decision. For example, it is
usually much easier to add options to a text menu than a
graphic-based menu. If you anticipate substantial growth or change in
a particular area, it may make sense to employ a textual navigation
bar, like the one in <a href="ch04_05.htm">Figure 4-10</a>. Cost is also an
issue, since graphic navigation bars require more work to create and
change than text-based bars. In many cases, you might employ a
graphic bar for global navigation and a textual menu for local
navigation. A good graphic designer will strike an elegant balance
between form and function in creating these navigation bars.</p>

<p>
<a name="INDEX-244" />
<a name="INDEX-245" />It is often best to place the navigation bar towards the top and/or bottom of the page, rather than at the side.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a> Placement at the top provides immediate access to the navigation system as well as an instant sense of context within the site. This supports the scenario in which a user quickly scans the first paragraph and decides to move on to other areas of the site. Placement at the bottom assumes navigation once the page has been fully read. Placement at both the top and bottom should be determined by the length of the content.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-9" /><p>[9]One usability study showed that "Sites with navigation buttons or links at the top and bottom of pages did slightly better than sites with navigation buttons down the side of the page." Spool et al., 24.</p>

</blockquote>





<p>
<a name="INDEX-246" />
<a name="INDEX-247" />Graphical navigation bars may employ several
techniques for conveying content and context, including textual
labels and icons. Textual labels are the easiest to create and by far
most clearly indicate the contents of each option. Icons, on the
other hand, are relatively difficult to create and often fail to
indicate the contents of each option. It's difficult to
represent abstract concepts through images. A picture may say a
thousand words, but often they're the wrong words. Icons can
successfully be used to complement the <a name="INDEX-248" />
<a name="INDEX-249" />textual labels. Since repeat users may
become so familiar with the icons that they no longer take the time
to read the textual labels, icons are useful in facilitating rapid
menu selection for them. See <a href="ch04_05.htm">Figure 4-11</a> for an
example.</p>


<a name="ch04-20323" /><div class="figure"><img height="192" alt="Figure 4-11" src="figs/info_0411.gif" width="448" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-11. This navigation bar, which appears at the bottom of the page, demonstrates an interesting blend of graphic icons (with labels) and textual options. The global navigation icons provide a splash of color, while their labels ensure usability. The textual local navigation options allow for the creation of many footer navigation bars without restrictive costs.</h4>

<p>However, hidden minefields may plague an iconic system. First, the
Internet's global nature introduces the potential for confusion
or even anger, since an image may have very different meanings from
one culture to another. Second, the iconic system may work well for a
limited number of menu options, but if the decision is made to add
one or more options, creating an appropriate icon can be very
challenging. While icons certainly work well sometimes, the skillful
use of a color system can facilitate rapid menu selection without the
inherent problems of iconic systems. (For more about the use of
icons, see <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Labeling Systems"</a>.)<a name="INDEX-250" /></p>

<a name="ch04-9-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.5.2. Frames</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-251" /> <a name="INDEX-252" />Frames
present an additional factor to consider in the application of
textual or graphical navigation bars. Frames allow you to define one
or more independently scrollable "panes" within a single
browser window. Hypertextual links within one pane can control the
content displayed in other panes within that same window. This
enables the designer to create a static or independently scrolling
navigation bar that appears on every page in that area of the web
site. This frame-based navigation bar will be visible to the user in
the same location in the browser window even while scrolling through
long documents. By separating the navigation system from content in
this way, frames can provide added context and consistency as users
navigate a web site.</p>


<p>However, frames present several serious problems, both from the
consumer's and producer's perspective. Architects should
proceed very carefully in considering frame-based navigation
solutions. Let's review a few of the major considerations.</p>


<a name="ch04-10-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.5.2.1. Screen real estate</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-253" />Static navigation bars implemented
through frames often take up significant portions of valuable screen
real estate (see <a href="ch04_05.htm">Figure 4-12</a>). No matter how far the
user scrolls, the navigation bar always stays with them. The addition
of winking, blinking banner advertisements into the static navigation
bar often compounds this problem. On a large, high resolution monitor
this may be only a minor irritation. On a standard 640 x 480 monitor,
these frames can be really annoying. If you're going to use a
frame-based navigation bar, keep it relatively small and
non-obtrusive. You should also consider a vertical rather than
horizontal frame, since left-to-right reading lends itself to narrow
text columns like those found in newspapers and magazines.</p>


<a name="ch04-33604" /><div class="figure"><img height="299" alt="Figure 4-12" src="figs/info_0412.gif" width="499" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-12. <em class="emphasis">The</em> Wall Street Journal's Interactive Edition makes use of frames. It's a relatively elegant implementation, but it limits screen real estate and disables basic navigation features.</h4>
</div>



<a name="ch04-11-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.5.2.2. The page model</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-254" />
<a name="INDEX-255" />
<a name="INDEX-256" />The Web is built upon a model of
pages, with each page having a unique address or URL. Users are
familiar with the concept of pages. Frames confuse this issue, by
slicing up pages into independent panes of content. By violating the
page model, the use of frames frequently disables important browser
navigation features such as bookmarking, visited and unvisited link
discrimination, and history lists. Frames can also confuse and
frustrate users executing simple tasks such as using the back button,
reloading a page, and printing a page. While web browsers have
improved in their ability to handle frames, they can't remove
the confusion caused by violating the page model.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch04-12-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.5.2.3. Display speed</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-257" /> <a name="INDEX-258" />Right off the bat, a web page with
multiple panes will take a hit on display speed. Since each pane is a
separate file with its own URL, loading and displaying each pane
requires a separate client-server interaction. In other words, the
user spends a lot of time watching "Host Contacted"
messages fly by at the bottom of the screen. This problem is
compounded by heavy graphics use.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch04-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.5.2.4. Complex design</h3>


<p>In theory, there are some compelling reasons to try frames. You can
make global navigation bars or section headers (or advertisements)
visible to the user at all times. However, in practice, designing
user-friendly web sites using frames is quite challenging. Frames add
a layer of complexity that many architects and designers deal with
unsuccessfully. You must think about the multiple ways users will
access your frame-based documents. What if they come from another
frame-based document? Then you face the danger of frames within
frames. In addition, while most web browsers now support frames,
different browsers on different computer platforms display the frames
and their contents slightly differently. This requires more testing
and more careful design. Before using frames, make sure you consider
the additional overhead in architecture and design.</p>

<a name="ch04-14-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.5.3. Pull-Down Menus</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-259" />
<a name="INDEX-260" />Pull-down menus compactly provide for
many navigation options. The user can expand what appears as a
single-line menu to present dozens of options (as shown in <a href="ch04_05.htm">Figure 4-13</a>). The most common pull-down menus on the Web
are implemented using the standard interactive forms syntax. Users
must choose an option from the menu and then hit a Go or Submit
button to move to that destination.</p>


<a name="ch04-40216" /><div class="figure"><img height="611" alt="Figure 4-13" src="figs/info_0413.gif" width="500" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-13. This pull-down menu enables users to select a location without first going to a separate web page. This approach avoids further cluttering the main page with a long list of locations.</h4>

<p>You can implement a more sophisticated version of the pull-down menu
(also know as the <em class="emphasis">pop-up
menu</em>
<a name="INDEX-261" />) on the Web by using a programming
language such as Java or JavaScript. As the user moves the cursor
over a word or area on the page, a menu pops up. The user can
directly select an option from that menu.</p>


<p>Use pull-down and pop-up menus with caution. These menus allow
designers to pack lots of options on one page. This is usually what
you are working hard to avoid. Additionally, menus hide their options
and force the user to act before being able to see those options.
However, when you have a very straightforward, exact organization
scheme, these menus can work <a name="INDEX-262" /> <a name="INDEX-263" /> <a name="INDEX-264" /> <a name="INDEX-265" />well.<a name="INDEX-266" /> <a name="INDEX-267" /></p>
