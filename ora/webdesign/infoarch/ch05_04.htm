<h2 class="sect1">5.4. Creating Effective Labeling Systems</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-339" />Successful labeling
systems mirror the thinking and language of a site's users, not
its owners. If you've done your homework and created a sound
organizational system for your site, the labeling system should
follow its lead. So, for example, the labeling system should be
topical if the organization system is topical. But once you've
established a general approach (e.g., topical, task-oriented), where
should the actual labels, the words themselves, come from?</p>

<a name="ch05-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.4.1.1. The labels currently in place</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-341" />Your web site already has labels by
default. As you made some decisions during the course of the
site's creation, you probably won't want to throw those
labels out and start over. Instead, use them as a starting point for
developing a complete labeling system, taking into consideration the
decisions you made while creating the original system (if you can
still remember them).</p>


<p>Capture the existing labels in a single document. To do so,
you'll have to walk the entire site, either manually or
automatically, to gather the labels. You might consider assembling
them as a simple label table. Here's an example:</p>


<a name="ch05-14-fm2xml" /><table border="1">

<p>This label table is short because the site is small. Arranging these
labels in a condensed form provides a more accurate and complete view
as a system than if you looked at each label within the site page by
page. Inconsistencies are easier to catch; for example, we learned
that we were using three different labels for the same content (e.g.,
What We Do vs. What We Do. vs. Web Site Design, and Contact Argus.
vs. Contact Argus vs. Contacting Argus). As you can see, both the
wording and the use of periods was inconsistent, and possibly
confusing. Shame on us! This proves the point that it's easy to
create inconsistent labels even within a relatively small site.</p>

<h3 class="sect3">5.4.1.2. Other web sites</h3>


<p>If you don't have a site in place or are looking for new ideas,
you'll want to look elsewhere for labeling systems. The open
nature of the Web encourages an atmosphere of benevolent plagiarism,
so, just as you might view the source of a wonderfully designed page,
you can "borrow" from another site's great labeling
system. Make sure you're in top critical consumer mode to
ensure that your audiences' needs are well-represented. Then
surf your competitors' sites, borrowing what works and noting
what doesn't. Also look at academic sites that deal with your
site's subject; colleges and universities often have the luxury
of retaining label-happy librarians on their staffs to assist in site
creation.<a name="INDEX-342" /></p>

<h3 class="sect3">5.4.1.3. Controlled vocabularies and thesauri</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-343" /> <a name="INDEX-344" /> <a name="INDEX-345" /> <a name="INDEX-346" /> <a name="INDEX-347" />If you're feeling more
ambitious, other places have labeling systems from which to borrow.
<em class="emphasis">Controlled vocabularies</em> and <em class="emphasis">thesauri
</em>are often useful sources created by professionals with
library or subject-specific backgrounds. A controlled vocabulary is
simply a list of predetermined terms that describe a topic, such as
art or computer science. They are controlled in that you must use the
vocabulary's terms for a topic, and not an alternative term. A
common example is the set of categories found in any yellow pages
directory. When you're looking for movies or cinemas,
you'll find them listed under "Theatres-Cinema" and
nowhere else (why the Ann Arbor area directory uses the British
spelling for "theaters" is beyond us).</p>


<p>A thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary that includes relationships
between those terms, including:</p>


<ul><li><p>"See" or "Use" terms: Some thesauri include
common terms that aren't part of the controlled vocabulary,
with a reference to the appropriate controlled term to use. So, in
<a href="ch05_04.htm">Figure 5-7</a>, if you're looking for the term
<em class="emphasis">Draft</em>, you're instructed to use
<em class="emphasis">Compulsory military service</em> instead.</p></li><li><p>"See Also" or "Related" terms: These
relationships help you find other terms that might be of interest; in
<a href="ch05_04.htm">Figure 5-8</a>, the term <em class="emphasis">Domestic politics
and foreign policy</em> is related to <em class="emphasis">Bipartisan
foreign policy</em>, <em class="emphasis">Congress and foreign
policy</em>, and so on.</p></li><li><p>"Broader" or "Parent" terms: If a term is too
specific (i.e., its level of granularity is too fine), you might look
to see what topic it is a part of. In <a href="ch05_04.htm">Figure 5-8</a>,
<em class="emphasis">Domestic politics and foreign policy</em> is part of
the broader area of <em class="emphasis">foreign relations</em>.</p></li><li><p>"Narrower" or "Child" terms: Conversely, a
narrower term may provide the level of specificity you need.
<em class="emphasis">Dog</em> is a narrower term of
<em class="emphasis">Mammal</em>.</p></li></ul>

A subsection of the LIV (Legislative Indexing Vocabulary) thesaurus. Note that some terms are not considered part of the controlled vocabulary; instead, they refer you to a similar term that is part of the controlled vocabulary (e.g., for the uncontrolled term Draft, use Compulsory military service).</h4>


<a name="ch05-31036" /><div class="figure"><img height="395" alt="Figure 5-8" src="figs/info_0508.gif" width="378" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-8. The value of a thesaurus is in the relationships it specifies between terms: selecting a term in the controlled vocabulary (e.g., <em class="emphasis">Domestic politics and foreign policy</em>) displays a broader term, related terms, and a similar term (<b class="emphasis-bold">Used For</b>) that is not part of this controlled vocabulary.</h4>

<p>These additional relationships can be useful for determining the
labeling of the different levels of your site. If you've ever
used a library catalog, you are already familiar with a thesaurus:
the subject keywords associated with each book come from the
<em class="emphasis">Library of Congress Subject Headings</em>
(<em class="emphasis">LCSH</em>).</p>


<p>You can use and adapt terms from controlled vocabularies and
thesauri, but remember: the more narrow and specific the vocabulary
or thesaurus, the better its terms will perform for your site. The
<em class="emphasis">LCSH</em> is a thesaurus of terms intended to
describe the whole universe of knowledge. This is an expansive and
expensive task, and it's hard to keep up with all the changes
going on in the world; <em class="emphasis">LCSH</em> still includes
arcane terms like <em class="emphasis">water closet</em>.
<em class="emphasis">LCSH</em> may often be out-of-date and is designed to
be all things to all people; therefore, its terms may not be the best
fit for your site, which probably doesn't deal with all aspects
of human knowledge.</p>


<p>Instead, seek out vocabularies that are more narrowly focused and
that help specific audiences to access specific types of content. For
example, if your site's users are computer scientists, a
computer science thesaurus "thinks" the same way the
users do more than a general scheme like <em class="emphasis">LCSH</em>
would. A good example of a specific controlled vocabulary is the
<em class="emphasis">Legislative Indexing Vocabulary
</em>(<em class="emphasis">LIV</em>)<em class="emphasis">,</em> available
at <a href="../../../../../../lcweb.loc.gov/lexico/liv/brsearch.html,&#10%3B">http://lcweb.loc.gov/lexico/liv/brsearch.html,
</a> which was designed by the Congressional Research Service
to help users search in the Bill Summary &amp; Status files of
THOMAS, the Library of Congress' web site for federal
legislative information. If your site contains legislative
information, or if your site's audience are legislative types,
you might start with <em class="emphasis">LIV</em> as the basis of your
site's labeling system.<a name="INDEX-348" /> <a name="INDEX-349" /> <a name="INDEX-350" /> <a name="INDEX-351" /> <a name="INDEX-352" /></p>

<a name="ch05-17-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.4.1.4. Labels from content</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-353" />Labels can come from the
documents themselves. For example, if your site includes a number of
technical reports created by a host of different authors, you can use
the document's titles as part of an alphabetically sorted
labeling system. Or, if you're creating a subject-oriented
labeling system, you can learn a lot about these documents from the
terms used in their titles and from their abstracts, if available.
Perhaps you'll even read the reports themselves and come up
with some terms that describe their content.</p>


<p>If you do use terms directly from the documents, be careful! A common
(and wrong) assumption is that a document's author is the best
candidate to label its content. For example, <em class="emphasis">Gone With the
Wind</em> makes for an enticing title as we're sure
Margaret Mitchell intended, but as a label it doesn't work at
all. It has nothing to do with wind itself. Even if she had selected
a representational title for her book, Ms. Mitchell wasn't
concerned with how her book's title fit in with the titles of
other books and how well the title would support users who were
searching for it in an information system. If authors did have such
concerns, they might select their titles from thesauri like
<em class="emphasis">Library of Congress Subject Headings</em>! For
various reasons (artistic, marketing-related, and more),
authors' motives when they label their content may have
absolutely nothing to do with ensuring that their information gets
found. That's why it makes sense for <em class="emphasis">someone
else</em> to take a close look at what's being labeled
instead of relying upon the source to label the information
accurately.</p>
</div>



<a name="ch05-18-fm2xml" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.4.1.5. Labels from users and experts</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-354" /> <a name="INDEX-355" />Lastly, the users of a site may
be telling you, directly or indirectly, what the labels should be.
This isn't the easiest information to get your hands on, but if
you can, it's the best source of labeling there is.</p>


<p>It would be great to simply ask them what terms they use, but this
wouldn't be very practical. There is a less-intrusive source of
useful information on what labels your site's audiences
actually use: your search engine's query log (most search
engines do log user queries). Query analysis is a great way to
understand the types of labels your site's users typically use
(see Figures <a href="ch05_04.htm">Figure 5-9</a> and <a href="ch05_04.htm">Figure 5-10</a>). Besides shedding some light on user
searching behavior, query analysis can also help you understand the
content users are specifically asking for from your site. In the case
of search queries that retrieve no results, consider these terms as
candidates for inclusion in your labeling system, or consider adding
relevant content to your site so that queries using these terms
actually retrieve <em class="emphasis">something</em> in the future.</p>

The third through eighth came from the same IP address, and all took place within four minutes; this suggests that they were part of the same session by the same user.  </h4>

<p>Another less technical approach is to determine if there are any
advanced users or experts, such as
<a name="INDEX-356" />
<a name="INDEX-357" />librarians, switchboard
operators, or other information specialists who are very familiar
with the users' information needs, and who could therefore
speak on the users' behalf.</p>


<p>We found this to be a useful exercise with one of our clients, a
major health system. Working with their library staff, we set out to
create two labeling systems, one with medical terms to help medical
professionals browse the services offered by the health system, the
other for the lay audience to access the same content. It
wasn't difficult to come up with the medical terms, as there
are many thesauri and controlled vocabularies geared toward labeling
medical content. It was much more difficult to come up with a scheme
for the layperson's list of terms. There didn't seem to
be an ideal controlled vocabulary, and we couldn't draw labels
from the site's content very easily, as it hadn't been
created yet. So we were truly starting from scratch.</p>


<p>We solved this dilemma by asking ourselves what the users really
wanted out of the site. We considered their general needs, and came
up with a few major ones:</p>


<ol><li><p>They need information about or a solution for a problem, illness, or
condition.</p></li><li><p>The problem is with a particular organ or part of the body.</p></li><li><p>They want to know about the diagnostics or tests the health care
professionals will perform to learn more about the problem.</p></li><li><p>They need information on the treatment, drug, or solution that will
be provided by the health system.</p></li><li><p>They want to know how they can pay for the service.</p></li><li><p>They want to know how they can maintain their health.</p></li></ol>
<p>We then could come up with basic terms to cover the majority of these
six categories, taking care to use terms appropriate to this audience
of laypersons. Here are some examples:</p>


<a name="ch05-19-fm2xml" /><table border="1">

<p>Category</p></th>

</table>

<p>By starting with a few groupings, we were able to generate labels to
support indexing the site. We knew a bit about the audience (who were
laypersons), and so were able to generate the right kinds of terms to
support their needs (e.g., <em class="emphasis">leg</em> instead of
<em class="emphasis">femur</em>). The secret was working with people (in
this case, staff librarians) who were knowledgeable about the kind of
information the users <a name="INDEX-358" /> <a name="INDEX-359" />want.<a name="INDEX-360" /> <a name="INDEX-361" /></p>
