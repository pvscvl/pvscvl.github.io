<h2 class="sect1">4.4. Types of Navigation Systems</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-214" />A complex web site often includes several
types of navigation systems. To design a successful site, it is
essential to understand the types of systems and how they work
together to provide flexibility and context.</p>


<a name="ch04-3-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.4.1. Hierarchical Navigation Systems</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-215" />Although we may not typically think of it
this way, the information hierarchy is the primary navigation system.
From the main page to the destination pages that house the actual
content, the main options on each page are taken directly from the
hierarchy (see <a href="ch04_04.htm">Figure 4-5</a>). As noted earlier, the
hierarchy is extremely important, but also rather limiting. It is
these limitations that often require additional navigation systems.</p>

</div>




<a name="ch04-4-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.4.2. Global Navigation Systems</h3>


<p>A <a name="INDEX-216" /> <a name="INDEX-217" /> <a name="INDEX-218" /> <a name="INDEX-219" />global
or site-wide navigation system often complements the information
hierarchy by enabling greater vertical and lateral movement
throughout the entire site. At the heart of most global navigation
systems are some standard rules that dictate the implementation of
the system at each level of the site.</p>


<p>The simplest global navigation system might consist of a graphical
navigation bar at the bottom of each page on the site. On the main
page, the bar might be unnecessary, since it would duplicate the
primary options already listed on that page. On second level pages,
the bar might include a link back to the home page and a link to the
feedback facility, as in <a href="ch04_04.htm">Figure 4-6</a>.</p>


<a name="ch04-39438" /><div class="figure"><img height="239" alt="Figure 4-6" src="figs/info_0406.gif" width="430" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-6. The MVAC Web site employs a very simple, icon-based global navigation system.</h4>

<p>A slightly more complex global navigation system may provide for
area-specific links on third level pages and below. For example, if a
user explores the products area of the web site, the navigation bar
could include <em class="emphasis">Main Page</em>,
<em class="emphasis">Products</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Search</em>. The
obvious exception to this rule-based system is that pages should not
include navigation links to themselves. For example, the main page of
the products area should not include a <em class="emphasis">Products</em>
link. However, this is a great opportunity for the site's
graphic designer to devise the navigation bar to show that you are
currently on the main page of the products area. Designers often
leverage a folder tab or button metaphor to accomplish this effect.
(On the Argus web site, we use the @ sign from our corporate logo, as
seen in <a href="ch04_04.htm">Figure 4-7</a>.)</p>


<a name="ch04-24953" /><div class="figure"><img height="298" alt="Figure 4-7" src="figs/info_0407.gif" width="452" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-7. For the Argus web site, graphic designers from Q LTD came up with a creative and elegant solution to show context within the navigation system by leveraging the @ sign from our corporate logo. In this example, the @ sign indicates that the Publications page is within the What We Do area.</h4>

<p>As you can see, this type of rule-based global navigation system can
easily be applied throughout the entire web site. The navigation
system and the graphic design system should be integrated to provide
both flexibility and context. Note that the relative locations of the
options should remain the same from one version of the bar to another
and that, since people read from left to right, <em class="emphasis">Main
Page</em> should be to the left of the other options. Both
these factors enhance the context within the hierarchy.<a name="INDEX-220" /> <a name="INDEX-221" /> <a name="INDEX-222" /></p>

<a name="ch04-5-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.4.3. Local Navigation Systems</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-223" />
<a name="INDEX-224" />
<a name="INDEX-225" />For a more
complex web site, it may be necessary to complement the global
navigation system with one or more local navigation systems. To
understand the need for local navigation systems, it is necessary to
understand the concept of a <em class="emphasis">sub-site</em>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a> The term sub-site was coined by Jakob Nielsen to identify
the recurrent situation in which a collection of web pages within a
larger site invite a common style and shared navigation mechanism
unique to those pages.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-7" /><p>[7]Jakob Nielsen, <em class="emphasis">The Rise of the Sub-Site</em>.
Sept, 1996
(<a href="../../../../../../www.useit.com/alertbox/9609.html">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9609.html</a>.)</p>

</blockquote>


<p>For example, a software company may provide an online product catalog
as one area in their web site. This product catalog constitutes a
sub-site within the larger web site of the software company. Within
this sub-site area, it makes sense to provide navigation options
unique to the product catalog, such as browsing products by name or
format or market.</p>


<p>However, it is also important to extend the global navigation system
throughout the sub-site. Users should still be able to jump back to
the main page or provide feedback. Local navigation systems should be
designed to complement rather than replace the global navigation
system (see <a href="ch04_04.htm">Figure 4-8</a>).</p>


<a name="ch04-31525" /><div class="figure"><img height="188" alt="Figure 4-8" src="figs/info_0408.gif" width="500" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-8.  In this example, the bulleted options are part of a simple local navigation system that guides users through information about the Digital Dissertations project. The graphical buttons at the lower left of the page are part of the global navigation system.</h4>

<p>This integration can be challenging, particularly when the global and
local navigation systems provide too many options. Alone they may
each be manageable, but together on one page, the variety of options
may overwhelm the user. In some cases, you may need to revisit the
number of global and local navigation options. In others, the problem
may be minimized through elegant page design.</p>

<a name="ch04-6-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.4.4. Ad Hoc Navigation</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-226" /> <a name="INDEX-227" />
<a name="INDEX-228" />Relationships between content items
do not always fit neatly into the categories of hierarchical, global,
and local navigation. An additional category of <em class="emphasis">ad
hoc</em> links is more editorial than architectural. Typically
an editor or content specialist will determine appropriate places for
these types of links once the content has been placed into the
architectural framework of the web site. In practice, this usually
involves representing words or phrases within sentences or paragraphs
(i.e., prose) as embedded hypertext links. This approach can be
problematic if these ad hoc links are important, since usability
testing shows "a strong negative correlation between embedded
links (those surrounded by text) and user success in finding
information."<a href="#FOOTNOTE-8">[8]</a> Apparently, users tend to scan pages so quickly that they
often miss these less conspicuous links. You can replace or
complement the embedded link approach with external links that are
easier for the user to see.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-8" /><p>[8]Spool et al., 41-42.</p>

<p><u class="emphasis-underline">Users</u>

<p><u class="emphasis-underline">One Solution to the Embedded Link Problem</u>
is to give links their own separate lines within the paragraph.</p>


<p>Another solution is to create a separate menu of ad hoc links at the
top or bottom of the page that point to useful related resources:</p>


<ul><li><p><u class="emphasis-underline">Embedded Links</u></p></li><li><p><u class="emphasis-underline">Users</u></p></li><li><p><u class="emphasis-underline">One Solution to the Embedded Link Problem</u></p></li></ul>
</td></tr></table>
</blockquote>

<p>The approach you use should be determined by the nature and
importance of the ad hoc links. For non-critical links provided as a
point of interest, embedded links can be an elegant, unobtrusive
solution.</p>


<p>When using ad hoc links, it's important to consider whether the
linked phrase provides enough context for the user. In <a href="ch04_04.htm">Figure 4-9</a>, it's fairly obvious where the Digital
Dissertations Pilot Site link will take you. However, if 1861 or 1997
were underlined, you would be hard pressed to guess where those links
would lead. In designing navigation systems for the Web, <a name="INDEX-233" /> <a name="INDEX-234" /> <a name="INDEX-235" />context is <a name="INDEX-236" />king.</p>

Moderation is the primary rule of thumb for guiding the creation of embedded ad hoc links. Used sparingly (as in this example), they can complement the existing navigation systems by adding one more degree of flexibility. Used in excess, ad hoc links can add clutter and confusion.</h4>
