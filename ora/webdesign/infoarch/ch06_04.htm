<p>
<a name="INDEX-449" /> <a name="INDEX-450" /> <a name="INDEX-451" /> <a name="INDEX-452" />Obviously, searching can get pretty
complex, and many pitfalls can prevent a user from achieving success.
So how does it get done in the non-Web world, and can we learn
anything from it?</p>


<p>In the real world, reference librarians and other information
professionals often make the difference. In fact, without them,
civilization would creak to a grinding halt. They are better than
anyone else at finding information because they break up what seems
to be a huge, complex information need into simpler, more digestible
components by conducting a <em class="emphasis">reference interview</em>
that is designed to learn more about the information need and its
context (unless, of course, you're just looking for the
bathroom or the copiers!).</p>


<p>Before you get spooked by the term <em class="emphasis">reference
interview</em>, consider that you probably have been through
quite a few of them yourself. When you go to the library and ask
someone behind the reference desk a question, they'll probably
respond with an open question, such as "Can you tell me a
little more about how you'll be using this information?"
The interview will often continue with more specific questions, such
as "Do you need this information for business (or school, a
dissertation, personal enjoyment, etc.)?" "Do you need it
right away (or can we take some time to do some more involved
searching or interlibrary loan for it)?" "Are you looking
for something at no cost (or would you like us to do a literature
search in some commercial databases like LEXIS/NEXIS or
DIALOG)?" "Are you looking for a few items (or do you
need all there is)?" and so on. These interactive iterations
help both the librarian understand what you're looking for, and
may also help you better understand your own needs by forcing you to
articulate them. In effect, both you and the librarian engage in
associative learning about the information need. Associative learning
comes naturally to humans, but is extremely difficult for software
systems to handle.</p>


<p>Can a web site do what a reference librarian does? Well, sort of, but
not quite. We've already covered a sample of the variation
found in users and their information needs, and we know that
well-architected sites can largely address these needs. If we can
determine the major needs of our sites' users and take steps to
address them, then perhaps we'll cover 80% of all possible
search queries. That would be wonderful, as most sites probably
don't do half that well. But that other 20%, the really tricky
stuff, can't be handled by automated means like a web site. You
really do need humans to help out in those situations, because only
humans are really good at figuring out context and knowing the right
questions to ask. Don't hold your breath for this issue to be
solved by an automated approach, such as with an intelligent agent.
Instead, consider making someone in your organization (maybe the
librarian, if your organization employs one) responsible for handling
the tough queries, and make sure your site actively seeks feedback
and directs it to those human information specialists.<a name="INDEX-453" /> <a name="INDEX-454" /> <a name="INDEX-455" /> <a name="INDEX-456" /></p>
