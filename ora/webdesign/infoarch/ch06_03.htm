<h2 class="sect1">6.3. Designing the Search Interface</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-410" />With so much variation among
users to account for, there can be no single ideal search interface.
Although the literature of information retrieval includes many
studies of search interface design, many variables preclude the
emergence of the right way to design search interfaces. Here are a
few of the variables on the table:</p>


<ul><li><p>The level of searching expertise users have: Are they comfortable
with Boolean operators, or do they prefer natural language? Do they
need a simple or high-powered interface? What about a help page?</p></li><li><p>The kind of information the user wants: Do they want just a taste, or
are they doing comprehensive research? Should the results be brief,
or should they provide extensive detail for each document?</p></li><li><p>The type of information being searched: Is it made up of structured
fields or full text? Is it navigation pages, destination pages, or
both? HTML or other formats?</p></li><li><p>How much information is being searched: Will users be overwhelmed by
the number of documents retrieved?</p></li></ul>
<p>We can, however, provide basic advice that you should consider when
designing a search interface.</p>


<a name="ch06-13-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.3.1. Support Different Modes of Searching</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-411" />Before diving into design, think
hard about why users are searching your site, and what they want to
get out of their search. Are they likely to search for certain types
of information, such as specific product descriptions or staff
directory entries? If so, support modes of searching that are
delineated by content types -- use the same interface to allow
users to search the product catalog, or the staff directory, or other
content areas (content-delineated indexing involves the creation of
<em class="emphasis">search zones</em>, which we'll cover later in
this chapter). Are non-English speakers important to your site? Then
provide them with search interfaces in their native languages,
including language-specific directions, search commands and
operators, and help information. Does your site need to satisfy users
with different levels of sophistication with online searching? Then
consider making available both a basic search interface and an
advanced one.</p>


<p>For example, one of our clients, UMI, sells dissertations to an
audience that includes researchers, librarians, and others who have
been using advanced online information systems for years. We needed
an interface that would accommodate this important expert audience
who were used to complex Boolean and proximity operators, and who
were already very used to the arcane search languages of other
commercial information services. However, a simple search interface
was also required, because at times users wouldn't need all the
firepower of an advanced search interface, especially when conducting
simple, known-item searches. Additionally, because it had become
available via the Web, a whole new audience of novices would
encounter this product for the first time; we assumed that these
newbies wouldn't be comfortable with a complex search
interface.</p>


<a name="ch06-17122" /><div class="figure"><img height="402" alt="Figure 6-1" src="figs/info_0601.gif" width="502" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-1. Although we could have simplified this interface by foregoing the three radio button selections, they add utility and let users know what they are searching without taking up too much screen space.</h4>

<p>So we created a simple interface that almost anyone could figure out
and use right away, shown above in <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-1</a>. A
simple search box is ideal for the novice or for a user with a pretty
good sense of what he or she is looking for. (We made sure to provide
a single search query box; our experience shows that most users
don't care for separate boxes, one for each query term, divided
by Boolean operators.) Minimal filtering options are provided,
including searching for keywords within title and abstract fields,
searching within the author field, or searching within the
publication number field. These filtering options provide the user
with more power by allowing more specific searching. But because the
labels Keyword, Author, and Publication Number are fairly
self-explanatory, they don't force the user to think too much
about these options.</p>


<a name="ch06-20254" /><div class="figure"><img height="423" alt="Figure 6-2" src="figs/info_0602.gif" width="488" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-2. Because they present so much information, more complex search interfaces generally can't be embedded on other pages and instead require a dedicated page.</h4>

<p>For the advanced users, a more powerful interface was created, shown
above in <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-2</a>. This interface supports the
following types of searching:</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Fielded Searching </b></dt>
<dd><p>
<a name="INDEX-412" />Author,
Keyword, Title, Subject, and ten other fields are searchable. A
researcher could, for example, find a dissertation related to his or
her area of interest by searching the subject field, and learn who
that doctoral student's advisor was by reading the abstract. To
find other related dissertations, the researcher could then search
the Advisor field to learn about other doctoral students who shared
the same advisor.</p></dd>


<dt><b>Familiar Query Language </b></dt>
<dd><p>In <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-2</a>, the style "field(search
term)" is used (e.g., "keyword(drosophila)").
Because many different query language conventions are supported by
traditional online products, users may be used to an established
convention. The effort to support these users is made by allowing
variant terms. For the field Degree Date, the user can enter either
"ddt," "da," "date,"
"yr," or "year."</p></dd>


<dt><b>Longer Queries </b></dt>
<dd><p>More complex queries often require more space than the single line
entry box found in the simple search interface in <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-1</a>. The more complex interface supports a much
longer query.</p></dd>


<dt><b>Reusable Result Sets </b></dt>
<dd><p>Many traditional online information products allow searchers to build
sets of results that can be reused. In this example, we've
ANDed together the two sets that we've already found, and could
in turn combine this result with other sets during the iterative
process of searching.</p></dd>

</dl>


<p>Because this advanced interface supports so many different types of
searching, we provided a substantial help page to assist users. For
users of common browsers, the help page shown in <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-3</a> launches in a separate browser window so that
users don't need to exit the search interface<a name="INDEX-413" /> to get help.</p>


<a name="ch06-10399" /><div class="figure"><img height="418" alt="Figure 6-3" src="figs/info_0603.gif" width="377" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-3. This help page serves as a ready reference to help users take advantage of the searching capability offered by this search engine and offers examples. It launches in a separate browser window.</h4>

<h3 class="sect2">6.3.2. Searching and Browsing Systems Should Be Closely Integrated</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-414" /> <a name="INDEX-415" />As we mentioned earlier, users typically
need to switch back and forth between searching and browsing. In
fact, users often don't know if they need to search or browse
in the first place. Therefore, these respective systems
shouldn't live in isolation from one another.</p>


<p>When we redesigned the Argus Clearinghouse, we integrated these two
elements on a single page called Search/Browse, shown in <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-4</a>. This combined interface to searching and
browsing makes it clear to the user what he or she can do there. The
search/browse approach can be extended by making search and browse
options available on the search results page as well, especially on
null results pages, when a user might be at a dead end and needs to
be gently led back into the process of iterative searching and
browsing before frustration sets in.</p>

Because its vertical space requirements are relatively small, the simple search interface is located toward the top of the page. It is followed by a browsing scheme too long to be displayed in its entirety. But users get a sense of what they'll see if they scroll further.</h4>

<a name="ch06-15-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.3.3. Searching Should Conform to the Site's Look and Feel </h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-416" /> <a name="INDEX-417" />Search engine interfaces, and more
importantly, retrieval results, should look and behave like the rest
of your site. This advice may seem painfully obvious, but because
many search engines are packaged as ready-to-go add-ons to a site,
site developers don't bother to customize them.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-15">[15]</a> For example, the interface and
results produced by the Excite search engine are easy to detect. In
fact, they look and work so similarly from site to site that
it's easy to forget that they are actually parts of individual
sites. <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-5</a> is a great example of a search
interface which hasn't been customized, while <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-6</a> shows how the search interface can be
integrated with the rest of the site's look and feel.</p><blockquote class="footnote">

<a name="FOOTNOTE-15" /><p>[15]It should be mentioned that some search engines, like
AltaVista, don't allow you to modify search and retrieval

<h3 class="sect2">6.3.4. Search Options Should Be Clear</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-418" /> <a name="INDEX-419" />We all pay lip service to the need for
user documentation, but with searching, it's really a must.
Because so many different variables are involved with searching,
there are many opportunities for things to go wrong. On a Help or
Documentation page, consider letting the user know the following:</p>


<ol>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">What is being searched.</em> Users often assume that
their search query is being run against the full text of every page
in your site. Instead your site may support fielded searching (as in
the UMI example above), or another type of selective searching (see
"Indexing the Right Stuff " later in this chapter). If
they're curious, users should be able to find out exactly what
they are searching.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">How they can formulate search queries.</em> What good
is it to build in advanced querying capabilities if the user never
knows about them? Show off the power of your search engine with
excellent real life examples. In other words, make sure your examples
actually work and retrieve relevant documents if the user decides to
test them.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">User options.</em> Can the user do other neat things
such as changing the sorting order of retrieval results? Show them
off as well!</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">What to do if the user can't find the right
information.</em> It's important to provide the user with
some tricks to handle the following three situations:</p>
<blockquote>
a. "I'm getting too much stuff."<br>
b. "I'm not getting anything."<br>
c. "The stuff I'm getting stinks!"
</blockquote>
<p>For case (a), you might suggest approaches that narrow the retrieval
results. For example, if your system supports the Boolean operator
AND, suggest that users combine multiple search terms with an AND
between them (ANDing together terms reduces retrieval size).</p>


<p>If they are retrieving zero results, as in case (b), suggest the
operator OR, the use of multiple search terms, the use of truncation
(which will retrieve a term's variants), and so on.</p>


<p>If they are completely dissatisfied with their searches, case (c),
you might suggest that they contact someone who knows the
site's content directly for custom assistance. It may be a
resource-intensive approach, but it's a far superior last
resort to ditching the user without helping them at all.<a name="INDEX-420" /> <a name="INDEX-421" /></p></li></ol>
</div>




<a name="ch06-17-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.3.5. Choose a Search Engine That Fits Users' Needs</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-422" />
<a name="INDEX-423" />At this point, you ideally will know
something about the sorts of searching capabilities that your
site's users will require (not to mention what your budget will
allow!). So select a search engine that satisfies those needs as much
as possible. For example, if you know that your site's users
are already very familiar with a particular way of specifying a
query, such as the use of Boolean operators, then the search engine
you choose should also support using Boolean operators. Does the size
of your site suggest that users will get huge retrieval results? Be
sure that your engine supports techniques for whittling down
retrieval sizes, such as the AND and NOT operators, or that it
supports relevance-ranked results that list the most relevant results
at the top. Will users have a problem with finding the right terms to
use in their search queries? Consider building in a thesaurus
capability (AltaVista's SearchWizard
(<a href="../../../../../../altavista.digital.com/av/lt/help.html">http://altavista.digital.com/av/lt/help.html</a>)
is a common example) or synonym table so that a query for the term
<em class="emphasis">car</em> may retrieve documents with the term
<em class="emphasis">automobile</em>. As the market for search engines
booms, more and more interesting options will be packaged with these
tools; let your users' needs be the major factor that guides
your choice.</p>

<a name="ch06-19-fm2xml" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.3.6. Display Search Results Sensibly</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-425" /> <a name="INDEX-426" />You can configure how your search
engine displays search results in many ways. There is no right way to
do it. How you configure your search engine's results depends
on two factors.</p>


<p>The first factor is the degree of structure your
<a name="INDEX-427" />content has. What will your search
engine be able to display besides just the titles of retrieved
documents? Is your site's content sufficiently structured so
that the engine can parse out and display such information as an
author, a date, an abstract, and so on?</p>


<p>The other factor is what your site's users really want. What
sorts of information do they need and expect to be provided as they
review search results?</p>


<p>When you are configuring the way your search engine displays results,
you should consider these issues:</p>


<ol><li><p>How much information should be displayed for each retrieved document?</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-428" />
<a name="INDEX-429" />A simple rule is
to display less information per result when you anticipate large
result sets. This will shorten the length of the results page, making
it easier to read. Another rule is to display less information to
users who know what they're looking for, and more information
to users who aren't sure what they want. (Based on your initial
research and assumptions about who will be using your site, you
should be able to make at least an intelligent guess as to which
types of users your site should support.)</p>


<p>When it's hard to distinguish retrieved documents because of a
commonly displayed field (such as the title), show more information
to help the user differentiate the results. Consider allowing the
user to choose how much information should be displayed. The Ann
Arbor District Library, for example, allows users to display
retrieval results in three different modes, thus allowing the same
tool to serve users with varying information needs; see <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-7</a>.</p>


<a name="ch06-19528" /><div class="figure"><img height="335" alt="Figure 6-7" src="figs/info_0607.gif" width="488" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-7. The Ann Arbor District Library provides three options (Citation, Summary, and Full) to help users control the amount of information they receive about each retrieved document.</h4></li>

<li><p>What information should be displayed for each retrieved document?</p>


<p>Which fields you show for each document obviously depends on which
fields are available in each document (i.e., how structured your
content is). What your engine displays also depends on how the
content is to be used. Users of phone directories, for example, want
phone numbers first and foremost. So it makes sense to show them the
information from the <em class="emphasis">phone number</em> field on the
results page (see Figures <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-8</a> and <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-9</a>). Lastly, the amount of space available on a
page is limited: you can't have each field displayed, so you
should choose carefully, and use the space that is available wisely.</p>


<a name="ch06-28401" /><div class="figure"><img height="339" alt="Figure 6-8" src="figs/info_0608.gif" width="488" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-8. Although this page from the Four11 phone directory is visually uncluttered, it could be better ; users need to click on a name to retrieve the actual phone number. City, state, and ZIP codes are useful in helping distinguish one C. Harris from the other, but there is no good reason not to display phone numbers on this page.</h4>

<a name="ch06-22025" /><div class="figure"><img height="435" alt="Figure 6-9" src="figs/info_0609.gif" width="500" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-9. Yahoo!'s phone directory may not be as aesthetically appealing, but it gets the job done. Users can use the address information to determine the right C. Harris, and then can view the phone number without clicking further. The use of single lines for each entry also minimizes scrolling.</h4></li>

<li><p>How many retrieved documents should be displayed?</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-430" />How many documents are displayed
depends on the preceding two factors. If your engine displays a lot
of information for each retrieved document, you'll want to
consider a smaller size for the retrieval set, and vice versa.
Additionally, the user's monitor resolution and browser
settings will affect the amount of information that can be displayed
individually. Your best bet is to provide a variety of settings that
the user can opt to select based on his or her own needs, and always
let the user know the total number of retrieved documents.</p>


<li><p>How should retrieved documents be sorted?</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-431" />
<a name="INDEX-432" />
<a name="INDEX-433" />

Common options for sorting
retrieval results include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>in chronological order</p></li>
<li><p>alphabetically by title, author, or other fields</p></li>
<li><p>by an odd thing called relevance</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Certainly, if your site is providing access to press releases or
other news-oriented information, sorting by <em class="emphasis">reverse
</em>chronological order makes good sense. Chronological order
is less common, and can be useful for presenting historical data.</p>


<p>Alphabetical sorts are a good general purpose sorting approach (most
users are familiar with the order of the alphabet!). Alphabetical
sorting works best if initial articles such as <em class="emphasis">a</em>
and <em class="emphasis">the</em> are omitted from the sort order (certain
search engines provide this option). Users will find this helpful as
they are more likely to look for <em class="emphasis">The Naked Bungee Jumping
Guide</em> under <em class="emphasis">N</em> rather than
<em class="emphasis">T</em>.</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-434" /> <a name="INDEX-435" /> <a name="INDEX-436" />Relevance <a name="INDEX-437" />is an interesting concept; when a
search engine retrieves 2,000 documents, isn't it great to have
them sorted with the most relevant at the top, and the least relevant
at the bottom? Well, certainly, if this actually would work.
Relevance ranking algorithms (there are many flavors) are typically
determined by some combination of the following: how many of the
query's terms occur in the retrieved document; how many times
those terms occur in that document; how close to each other those
terms occur (e.g., are they adjacent, in the same sentence, or in the
same paragraph?); and where the terms occur (e.g., a document with
the query term in its title is more likely to be relevant than a
document with the query term in its body).</p>


<p>It's confusing for certain if you're responsible for
configuring the search engine, and probably more so for users.
Different relevance ranking algorithms make sense for different types
of content, but with most search engines, the content you're
searching is apples and oranges. So, for example, a retrieval might
rank Document A higher than Document B, but Document B is definitely
more relevant. Why? Because Document B is a bibliographic citation to
a really relevant work, but Document A is a long document that just
happens to contain many instances of the terms in the search query.</p>


<p>Our advice is to use relevance with caution and consider doing
something that few search tools do: <em class="emphasis">let the user know how
your engine is calculating relevance.</em> Or, as with the Java
implementation of Lycos Pro (<a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-10</a>), let the
user control the relevance algorithm.</p></li></ol>
<a name="ch06-28049" /><div class="figure"><img height="464" alt="Figure 6-10" src="figs/info_0610.gif" width="500" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-10. Lycos Pro's Java Power Panel allows users to determine which document characteristics are most relevant to their searches through adjusting their settings. Although it's not likely something you'll whip up in minutes for your own site, it is an interesting concept.</h4>

<p>Many search engines use counterintuitive sorting approaches by
default, including when the file was last updated or indexed (a
variant of chronological ordering), or what physical directory the
file resides in. Avoid these defaults; they are obtuse and will
confuse the user. Whatever approach you use, make the ranking order
clear to users by making the sort field a prominent part of each
result. Consider shifting the decision on what sort is most useful by
giving the user the option of selecting their own sorting option.

<h3 class="sect2">6.3.8. Always Provide the User with Feedback</h3>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-445" />
<a name="INDEX-446" /> <a name="INDEX-447" />When a user executes a search, he or
she expects results. Usually, a query will retrieve at least one
document, so the user's expectation is fulfilled. But sometimes
a search retrieves zero results. Let the user know by creating a
different results page specially for these cases. This page should
make it painfully clear that nothing was retrieved, and give an
explanation as to why, tips for improving retrieval results, and
links to both the Help area and to a new search interface so the user
can try again (see <a href="ch06_03.htm">Figure 6-14</a>).</p>

Although no results were retrieved, the user is presented with other options, such as trying another search, reviewing the search tips, or switching to browse mode. These options dissuade users from giving up on finding information in the site.</h4>

<h3 class="sect2">6.3.9. Other Considerations</h3>


<p>You might also consider including a few easy-to-implement but very
useful things in your engine's search results:</p>


<ul><li><p>Repeat back the original search query prominently on the results
page.</p>


<p>As users browse through search results, they may forget what they
searched for in the first place. Remind them. Also include the query
in the page's title; this will make it easier for users to find
it in their browser's history lists.</p></li><li><p>Let the user know how many documents in total were retrieved.</p>


<p>Users want to know how many documents have been retrieved before they
begin reviewing the results. Let them know; if the number is too
large, they should have the option to refine their search.</p></li><li><p>Let the user know where he or she is in the current retrieval set.</p>


<p>It's helpful to let users know that they're viewing
documents 31- 40 of the 83 total that they've retrieved.</p></li><li><p>Always make it easy for the user to revise a search or start a new
one.</p>


<p>Give them these options on every results page, and display the
current search query on the Revise Search page so they can modify it
without reentering it.<a name="INDEX-448" /></p></li></ul>
