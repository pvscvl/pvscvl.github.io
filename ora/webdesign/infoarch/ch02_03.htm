<h2 class="sect1">2.3. Collaboration and Communication</h2>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-69" />
<a name="INDEX-70" /> <a name="INDEX-71" />The
information architect must communicate effectively with the web site
development team. This is challenging, since an information
architecture is highly abstract and intangible. Besides communicating
the architecture verbally, documents (such as blueprint diagrams)
must be created in ways that can be understood by the rest of the
team regardless of their own disciplinary backgrounds.</p>


<p>
<a name="INDEX-72" />In the early days of the Web, web sites were
often designed, built, and managed by a single individual through
sheer force of will. This webmaster was responsible for assembling
and organizing the content, designing the graphics, and hacking
together any necessary CGI scripts. The only prerequisites were a
familiarity with HTML and a willingness to learn on the job. People
with an amazing diversity of backgrounds suddenly became webmasters
overnight, and soon found themselves torn in many directions at once.
One minute they were information architects, then graphic designers,
then editors, then programmers.</p>


<p>Then companies began to demand more of their sites and, consequently,
of their webmasters. Simple home pages quickly evolved into complex
web sites. People wanted more content, better organization, greater
function, and prettier graphics. Extensions, plug-ins, and languages
proliferated. Tables, VRML, frames, Shockwave, Java, and ActiveX were
added to the toolbox. No mortal webmaster could keep up with the
rising expectations and the increasing complexity of the environment.</p>


<p>Increasingly, webmasters and their employers began to realize that
the successful design and production of complex web sites requires an
interdisciplinary team approach. An individual cannot be an expert in
all facets of the process. Rather, a team of individuals with
complementary areas of expertise must work together. The composition
of this team will vary, depending upon the needs of a particular
project, available budget, and the availability of expertise.
However, most projects will require expertise in marketing,
information architecture, graphic design, writing and editing,
programming, and project management.</p>


<dl>
<dt><b>Marketing	</b></dt>
<dd><p>
<a name="INDEX-73" />The marketing team
focuses on the intended purposes and audiences for the web site. They
must understand what will bring the right people to the web site and
what will bring them back again.</p></dd>


<dt><b>Information Architecture</b></dt>
<dd><p>The information architects focus on the design of organization,
indexing, labeling, and navigation systems to support browsing and
searching throughout the web site.</p></dd>


<dt><b>Graphic Design</b></dt>
<dd><p>
<a name="INDEX-74" />
<a name="INDEX-75" />The designers are responsible
for the graphic design and page layout that defines the graphic
identity or look of the web site. They strive to create and implement
a design philosophy that balances form and function.</p></dd>


<dt><b>Editorial</b></dt>
<dd><p>
<a name="INDEX-76" />Editors focus on the use of language
throughout the web site. Their tasks may involve proofreading and
editing copy, massaging content to ensure a common voice for the
site, and creating new copy.</p></dd>


<dt><b>Technical</b></dt>
<dd><p>
<a name="INDEX-77" />The technical designers and programmers are
responsible for server administration and the development or
integration of site production tools and web site applications. They
advise the other teams regarding technology-related opportunities and
limitations.</p></dd>


<dt><b>Project Management</b></dt>
<dd><p>The <a name="INDEX-78" />project manager keeps the project on
schedule and within budget. He or she facilitates communication
between the other teams and the clients or internal stakeholders.</p></dd>

</dl>


<p>The success of a web site design and production project depends on
successful communication and collaboration between these specialized
team members. A linear, black-box, throw-it-over-the-wall methodology
just won't work. Everyone needs to understand the goals,
perspectives, and approaches of the other members of the team. For
example, while the marketing specialist may lead the audience
analysis process, he or she needs to anticipate the types of
questions about the audience that the specialists will have.
Otherwise, each will need to start from scratch in learning about
that audience, wasting substantial time and resources.</p>


<p>For the information architect, communication is a special challenge
because of the intangible nature of the work. Anyone who has played
Pictionary knows that it is much harder to draw an abstract concept
such as <em class="emphasis">science</em> than a physical object such as
<em class="emphasis">moon</em>. As an information architect, you face the
daunting challenge of helping others visualize such abstract concepts
as a <em class="emphasis">metaphor-based architecture</em> and
<em class="emphasis">indexing systems</em>.</p>


<p>The information architect has to identify both the goals of the site
and the content that it will be built on. This means getting the
people who drive the business, whether bosses or clients, to
articulate their vision of the site and who its users are. Once
you've collected the data and developed a plan, you need to
present your ideas for an information architecture and move the group
toward consensus. All in all, this significantly burdens the
architect to communicate effectively.<a name="INDEX-79" /> <a name="INDEX-80" /> <a name="INDEX-81" /></p>


<p>This is the point of the rest of this book. The next four chapters
introduce the foundations of information architecture to support your
efforts to communicate an information architecture by providing
useful terms, definitions, and concepts. <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "Research"</a> through <a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "Information Architecture in Action"</a>
provide a framework for these communications, and for the role of
architecture in site development as a whole.</p>
