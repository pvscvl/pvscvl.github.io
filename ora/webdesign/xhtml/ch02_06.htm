<h2 class="sect1">2.6. Text</h2>

<p>Text-related HTML/XHTML markup tags comprise the richest set of all
in the standard languages. That's because the original
language -- HTML -- emerged as a way to enrich the structure
and organization of text.
</p>

<p>HTML came out of academia. What was and still is important to those
early developers was the ability of their mostly academic,
text-oriented documents to be scanned and read without sacrificing
their ability to distribute documents over the Internet to a wide
diversity of computer display platforms. (ASCII text is the only
universal format on the global Internet.) Multimedia integration is
something of an appendage to HTML and XHTML, albeit an important one.
</p>

<p>And <a name="INDEX-127" />
<a name="INDEX-128" />page
layout is secondary to structure. We humans visually scan and decide
textual relationships and structure based on how it looks; machines
can only read encoded markings. Because documents have encoded tags
that relate meaning, they lend themselves very well to
computer-automated searches and also to the recompilation of
content -- features very important to researchers. It's not
so much <em class="emphasis">how</em> something is said as
<em class="emphasis">what</em> is being said.
</p>

<p>Accordingly, neither HTML nor XHTML are page-layout languages. In
fact, given the diversity of user-customizable browsers as well as
the diversity of computer platforms for retrieval and display of
electronic documents, all these markup languages strive to accomplish
is to <em class="emphasis">advise,</em> not dictate, how the document
might look when rendered by the browser. You cannot force the browser
to display your document in any certain way. You'll hurt your
brain if you insist otherwise.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.1. Appearance of Text</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-129" /> <a name="INDEX-130" />For instance, you cannot predict what
font and what absolute size -- 8- or 40-point Helvetica, Geneva,
Subway, or whatever -- will be used for a particular user's
text display. Okay, so the latest browsers now support standard
Cascading Style Sheets and other desktop publishing-like features
that let you control the layout and appearance of your documents. But
users may change their browser's display characteristics and
override your carefully laid plans at will; quite a few of the older
browsers out there don't support these new layout features; and
some browsers are text-only with no nice fonts at all. What to do?
Concentrate on content. Cool pages are a flash in the pan. Deep
content will bring people back for more and more.
</p>

<p>Nonetheless, <a name="INDEX-131" />style does matter for
readability, and it is good to include it where you can, as long as
it doesn't interfere with content presentation. You can attach
common style attributes to your text with <em class="emphasis">physical
style</em> tags like the italic <tt class="literal">&lt;i&gt;</tt>
tag in the simple example. More importantly and truer to the
language's original purpose, HTML and XHTML have
<em class="emphasis">content-based</em> style tags that attach
<em class="emphasis">meaning</em> to various text passages. And you can
alter text display characteristics, such as font style and size,
color, and so on, with Cascading Style Sheets.
</p>

<p>Today's graphical browsers recognize the physical and
content-related text style tags and change the appearance of their
related text passage to visually convey meaning or structure. You
can't predict exactly what that change will look like.
</p>

<p>The HTML 4 standard, and particularly the XHTML 1.0 standard, stress
that future browsers will not be so visually bound. Text contents may
be heard or even felt, for example, not read by viewers. Context
clues surely are better in those cases than physical styles.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-6.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.6.1.1. Content-based text styles</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-132" /> <a name="INDEX-133" />Content-based style tags indicate to the
browser that a portion of your HTML/XHTML text has a specific usage
or meaning. The <tt class="literal">&lt;cite&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-134" /> tag in our simple
example, for instance, means the enclosed text is some sort of
citation -- the document's author, in this case. Browsers
commonly, although not universally, display the citation text in
italic, not as regular text. <a href="ch04_04.htm">Section 4.4, "Content-Based Style Tags"</a>
</p>

<p>While it may or may not be obvious to the current reader that the
text is a citation, someday, someone might create a computer program
that searches a vast collection of documents for embedded
<tt class="literal">&lt;cite&gt;</tt> tags and compiles a special list of
citations from the enclosed text. Similar software agents already
scour the Internet for embedded information to compile listings, such
as the infamous Webcrawler and the AltaVista database of web sites.
</p>

<p>The most common content-based style used today is that of emphasis,
indicated with the <tt class="literal">&lt;em&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-135" /> <a name="INDEX-136" /> tag. And if
you're feeling really emphatic, you might use the
<tt class="literal">&lt;strong&gt;</tt> content style. Other content-based
styles include <tt class="literal">&lt;code&gt;</tt>
<a name="INDEX-137" /> <a name="INDEX-138" /> <a name="INDEX-139" /> <a name="INDEX-140" /> <a name="INDEX-141" />, for snippets of
programming code; <tt class="literal">&lt;kbd&gt;</tt>, to denote text
entered by the user via a keyboard; <tt class="literal">&lt;samp&gt;</tt>,
to mark sample text; <tt class="literal">&lt;dfn&gt;</tt>, for definitions;
and <tt class="literal">&lt;var&gt;</tt>, to delimit variable names within
programming code samples. All of these tags have corresponding end
tags.
</p>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-6.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.6.1.2. Physical styles</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-142" />Even the
barest of barebones text processors conform to a few traditional text
styles, such as italic and bold characters. While not word-processing
tools in the traditional sense, HTML and XHTML do provide tags that
tell the browser explicitly to display (if it can) a character, word,
or phrase in a particular physical style.
</p>

<p>Although you should use related content-based tags for the reasons we
argue earlier, sometimes form is more important than function. So use
the <tt class="literal">&lt;i&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-143" /> <a name="INDEX-144" /> <a name="INDEX-145" /> tag to italicize text, without
imposing any specific meaning; the <tt class="literal">&lt;b&gt;</tt> tag
to display text in boldface; or the <tt class="literal">&lt;tt&gt;</tt> tag
so that the browser, if it can, displays the text in a teletype-style
monospaced typeface. <a href="ch04_05.htm">Section 4.5, "Physical Style Tags"</a>
</p>

<p>It's easy to fall into the trap of using physical styles when
you should really be using a content-based style instead. Discipline
yourself now to use the content-based styles, because, as we argue
earlier, they convey meaning as well as style, thereby making your
documents easier to automate and manage.
</p>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-6.1.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.6.1.3. Special text characters</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-146" /> <a name="INDEX-147" />Not all text characters available to
you for display by a browser can be typed from the keyboard. And some
characters have special meanings, such as the brackets around tags,
which if not somehow differentiated when used for plain
text -- the <a name="INDEX-148" /> <a name="INDEX-149" />less-than sign (&lt;) in a math
equation, for example -- will confuse the browser and trash your
document. HTML and XHTML give you a way to include any of the many
different characters that comprise the ASCII character set anywhere
in your text through a special encoding of its
<a name="INDEX-150" />
<a name="INDEX-151" />
<a name="INDEX-152" /> <a name="INDEX-153" /><em class="emphasis">character
entity</em>.
</p>

<p>Like the copyright symbol in our simple example, a character entity
starts with an <a name="INDEX-154" />
<a name="INDEX-155" />ampersand
followed by its name, and terminated with a
<a name="INDEX-156" /> <a name="INDEX-157" />semicolon. Alternatively, you may also
use the character's position number in the ASCII table of
characters preceded by the pound or sharp sign (<a name="INDEX-158" />
<a name="INDEX-159" /> <a name="INDEX-160" />#) in lieu of its name in the
character entity sequence. When rendering the document, the browser
displays the proper character, if it exists in the user's font.
<a href="ch03_05.htm">Section 3.5.2, "Character Entities"</a>
</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, the most commonly used character entities are
the greater-than (<tt class="literal">&amp;gt;</tt>), less-than
(<tt class="literal">&amp;lt;</tt>), and ampersand
(<tt class="literal">&amp;amp;</tt>) characters. Check 
<a href="appf_01.htm">Appendix F, "Character Entities"</a> to find what symbol the character entity
<tt class="literal">&amp;#166;</tt> represents.<a name="INDEX-161" />
</p>

</div>
</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.2. Text Structures</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-162" />
<a name="INDEX-163" />It's not obvious in our simple
example, but the common carriage returns we use to separate
paragraphs in our source document have no meaning in HTML or XHTML,
except in special circumstances. You could have typed the document
onto a single line in your text editor and it would still appear the
same in <a href="ch02_02.htm">Figure 2-1</a>.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-7" /><p>[7]We use a
computer programming-like style of indentation so that our source
HTML/XHTML documents are more readable. It's not obligatory,
nor are there any formal style guidelines for source HTML/XHTML
document text formats. We do, however, highly recommend that you
adopt a consistent style, so that you and others can easily follow
your source documents.</p> </blockquote>

<p>You'd soon discover, too, if you hadn't read it here
first, that except in special cases, browsers typically ignore
leading and trailing spaces, and sometimes more than a few in
between. (If you look closely at the source example, the line
"Greetings from" looks like it should be indented by
leading spaces, but it isn't in <a href="ch02_02.htm">Figure 2-1</a>.)
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-6.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.6.2.1. Divisions, paragraphs, and line breaks</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-164" />
<a name="INDEX-165" />
<a name="INDEX-166" />
<a name="INDEX-167" />A browser takes the
text in the body of your document and "flows" it onto the
computer screen, disregarding any common carriage-return or line-feed
characters in the source. The browser fills as much of each line of
the display window as possible, beginning flush against the left
margin, before stopping after the rightmost word and moving on to the
next line. Resize the browser window, and the text reflows to fill
the new space, indicating HTML's inherent flexibility.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-168" />
<a name="INDEX-169" />Of
course, readers would rebel if your text just ran on and on, so HTML
and XHTML provide both explicit and implicit ways to control the
basic structure of your document. The most rudimentary and common
ways are with the division
(<tt class="literal">&lt;div&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-170" />), paragraph
(<tt class="literal">&lt;p&gt;</tt>), and line-break
(<tt class="literal">&lt;br&gt;</tt>) tags. All break the text flow, which
consequently restarts on a new line. The differences are that the
<tt class="literal">&lt;div&gt;</tt> and <tt class="literal">&lt;p&gt;</tt> tags
define an elemental region of the document and text, respectively,
the contents of which you may specially align within the browser
window, apply text styles to, and alter with other block-related
features.
</p>

<p>Without special alignment attributes, the
<tt class="literal">&lt;div&gt;</tt> and <tt class="literal">&lt;br&gt;</tt> tags
simply break a line of text and place subsequent characters on the
next line. The paragraph tag adds more vertical space after the line
break than either the <tt class="literal">&lt;div&gt;</tt> or
<tt class="literal">&lt;br&gt;</tt> tags. 

 <a href="ch04_01.htm">Section 4.1.1, "The &lt;div&gt; Tag"</a> 
<a href="ch04_01.htm">Section 4.1.2, "The &lt;p&gt; Tag"</a> <a href="ch04_07.htm">Section 4.7.1, "The &lt;br&gt; Tag"</a>
</p>

<p>By the way, the HTML standard includes end tags for the paragraph and
division tags, but not for the line-break tag.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-8">[8]</a> Few authors ever include the paragraph
end tag in their documents; the browser usually can figure out where
one paragraph ends and another begins.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a> Give
yourself a star if you knew that <tt class="literal">&lt;/p&gt;</tt> even
exists.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-8" /><p>[8]With
XHTML, &lt;br&gt;'s start and end are between the same
brackets: &lt;br /&gt;. Browsers tend to be very forgiving and often
ignore extraneous things, such as the forward slash in this case, so
it's perfectly okay to get into the habit of adding that
end-mark.</p> </blockquote><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-9" /><p>[9]The paragraph
end tag is being used more commonly now that the popular browsers
support the paragraph-alignment attribute.</p> </blockquote>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-6.2.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.6.2.2. Headings</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-171" />
<a name="INDEX-172" />Besides breaking your text into
divisions and paragraphs, you also can organize your documents into
sections with headings. Just as they do on this and other pages in
this printed book, headings not only divide and title discrete
passages of text: they also convey meaning visually. And headings
also readily lend themselves to machine-automated processing of your
documents.
</p>

<p>There are six heading tags, <tt class="literal">&lt;h1&gt;</tt> through
<tt class="literal">&lt;h6&gt;</tt>, with corresponding end tags.
Typically, the browser displays their contents in, respectively, very
large to very small font sizes, and sometimes in boldface. The text
inside the <tt class="literal">&lt;h4&gt;</tt> tag is usually the same size
as the regular text. <a href="ch04_02.htm">Section 4.2.1, "Heading Tags"</a>
</p>

<p>The heading tags also typically break the current text flow, standing
alone on lines and separated from surrounding text, even though there
aren't any explicit paragraph or line-break tags before or
after a heading.
</p>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-6.2.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.6.2.3. Horizontal rules</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-173" />
<a name="INDEX-174" />
<a name="INDEX-175" />Besides headings, HTML and XHTML provide
horizontal rule lines that help delineate and separate the sections
of your document.
</p>

<p>When the browser encounters an <tt class="literal">&lt;hr&gt;</tt> tag in
your document, it breaks the flow of text and draws a line completely
across the display window on a new line. The flow of text resumes
immediately below the rule.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a> <a href="ch05_01.htm">Section 5.1.1, "The &lt;hr&gt; Tag"</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-10" /><p>[10]Similar to &lt;br&gt;,
with XHTML the formal horizontal rule tag is &lt;hr/&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-6.2.4" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">2.6.2.4. Preformatted text</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-176" />
<a name="INDEX-177" />
<a name="INDEX-178" />Occasionally, you'll want the
browser to display a block of text as-is: for example, with indented
lines and vertically aligned letters or numbers that don't
change even though the browser window might get resized. The
<tt class="literal">&lt;pre&gt;</tt> tag rises to those occasions. All text
up to the closing <tt class="literal">&lt;/pre&gt;</tt> end tag appears in
the browser window exactly as you type it, including carriage
returns, line feeds, and leading, trailing, and intervening spaces.
Although very useful for tables and forms,
<tt class="literal">&lt;pre&gt;</tt> text turns out pretty dull; the
popular browsers render the block in a monospace typeface. <a href="ch04_07.htm">Section 4.7.5, "The &lt;pre&gt; Tag"</a>  <a name="INDEX-179" />
