<h2 class="sect1">5.6. Other Multimedia Content</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-1006" />The Web
is completely open minded about the types of content that can be
exchanged by servers and browsers. In this section, we look at a
different way to reference images, along with audio, video, and other
document formats.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-5-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.6.1. Embedded Versus Referenced Content</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1007" />
<a name="INDEX-1008" />Images
currently enjoy a special status among the various media that can be
included within an HTML or XHTML document and displayed inline with
other content by all but a few browsers. Sometimes, however, as we
discussed earlier in this chapter, you may also reference images
externally, particularly large ones in which details are important,
but not immediately necessary to the document content. Other
multimedia elements, including digital audio and video, can be
referenced as separate documents external to the current one.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1009" />You normally use the anchor
tag (<tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt>) to link external multimedia
elements to the current document. Just like other link elements
selected by the user, the browser downloads the multimedia object and
presents it to the user, possibly with the assistance of an external
application or plug-in. Referenced content is always a two-step
process: present the document that links to the desired multimedia
object, then present the object if the user selects the link. <a href="ch06_03.htm">Section 6.3.1, "The &lt;a&gt; Tag"</a>
</p>

<p>In the case of images, you can choose how to present images to the
user: inline and immediately available via the
<tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag, or referenced and subsequently
available via the <tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt> tag. If your images
are small and critical to the current document, you should provide
them inline. If they are large or are only a secondary element of the
current document, make them available as referenced content via the
<tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt> tag.
</p>

<p>If you choose to provide images via the <tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt>
tag, it is sometimes a courtesy to your readers to indicate the size
of the referenced image in the referencing document and perhaps
provide a thumbnail sketch. Users can then determine whether it is
worth their time and expense to retrieve it.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-5-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.6.2. Referencing Audio, Video, and Images</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1010" />
<a name="INDEX-1011" />
<a name="INDEX-1012" />
<a name="INDEX-1013" />You reference any external document,
regardless of type or format document via a conventional anchor
(<tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt>) link:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">The &lt;a href="sounds/anthem.au"&gt;Kumquat Grower's Anthem&lt;/a&gt; is a rousing tribute to 
the thousands of 'quat growers around the world.</pre></blockquote>

<p>Just like any referenced document, the server delivers the desired
multimedia object to the browser when the user selects the link. If
the browser finds the document is not HTML or XHTML, but some other
format, it automatically invokes an appropriate rendering tool to
display or otherwise convey the contents of the object to the user.
</p>

<p>You can configure your browser with special helper applications that
handle different document formats in different ways. Audio files, for
example, might be passed to an audio-processing tool, while video
files are given to a video-playing tool. If a browser has not been
configured to handle a particular document format, the browser will
inform you and offer to simply save the document to disk. You can
later use an appropriate viewing tool to examine the document.
</p>

<p>Browsers identify and specially handle multimedia files from one of
two different hints: either from the file's
<a name="INDEX-1014" />
<a name="INDEX-1015" />Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extension (MIME) type provided by the server or from a
special suffix in the file's name. The browser prefers MIME
because of its richer description of the file and its contents, but
will infer the file's contents (type and format) of the object
by the file suffix: <em class="emphasis">.gif</em> or
<em class="emphasis">.jpg</em>, for GIF and JPEG encoded images, for
example, or <em class="emphasis">.au</em> for a special sound file.
</p>

<p>Since not all browsers look for a MIME type, nor will they all be
correctly configured with helper applications by their users, you
should always use the correct file suffix in the names of multimedia
objects. See <a href="ch05_04.htm">Table 5-1</a> earlier in this chapter.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-5-SECT-6.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.6.3. Appropriate Linking Styles</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1016" />Creating
effective links to external multimedia documents is critical. The
user needs some indication of what the object is and perhaps the kind
of application the linked object needs to execute. Moreover, most
multimedia objects are quite large, so common courtesy tells us to
provide users with some indication of the time and expense involved
in downloading it.
</p>

<p>In lieu of, or in addition to, the anchor and surrounding text, a
small thumbnail of large images or a familiar icon that indicates the
referenced object's format is useful.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-5-SECT-6.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.6.4. Embedding Other Document Types</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1017" />
<a name="INDEX-1018" />
<a name="INDEX-1019" />
<a name="INDEX-1020" />
<a name="INDEX-1021" />
<a name="INDEX-1022" />The Web can deliver nearly any type of
electronic document, not just graphics, sound, and video files. To
display them, however, the client browser needs a helper application
installed and referenced. Recent browsers also support plug-in
accessory software and, as described in <a href="ch12_01.htm">Chapter 12, "Executable Content"</a>, may extend the browser
for some special function, including inline display of multimedia
objects.
</p>

<p>For example, consider a company whose extensive product documentation
was prepared and stored in some popular layout application such as
FrameMaker, Quark XPress, or PageMaker. The Web offers an excellent
way for distributing that documentation over a worldwide network, but
converting to HTML or XHTML would be too costly at this time.
</p>

<p>The solution is to prepare a few HTML or XHTML documents that catalog
and link the alternative files and invoke the appropriate display
applet. Or, make sure that the users' browsers have the plug-in
software or are configured to invoke the appropriate helper
application. Adobe's Acrobat Reader is a very popular plugin,
for example. If the document is in Acrobat (<em class="emphasis">.pdf</em>
) format, then if a link to an Acrobat document is chosen,
the tool is started and accordingly displays the document, often
right in the browser's window.<a name="INDEX-1023" />
