<h2 class="sect1">3.3. Tags and Attributes</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-287" />For the most part, tags -- the markup
elements of HTML and XHTML -- are simple to understand and use,
since they are made up of common words, abbreviations, and notations.
For instance, the <tt class="literal">&lt;i&gt;</tt> and
<tt class="literal">&lt;/i&gt;</tt> tags tell the browser respectively to
start and stop italicizing the text characters that come between
them. Accordingly, the syllable "simp" in our barebones
example above would appear italicized on a browser display.
</p>

<p>The HTML and XHTML standards and their various extensions define how
and where you place tags within a document. Let's take a closer
look at that syntactic sugar that holds together all documents.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-3-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.1. The Syntax of a Tag</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-288" /> <a name="INDEX-289" />
<a name="INDEX-290" />Every tag
<a name="INDEX-291" />consists of a tag
<em class="emphasis">name</em>, sometimes followed by an optional list of
tag <em class="emphasis">attributes</em>, all placed between opening and
closing brackets (&lt; and &gt;). The simplest tag is nothing more
than a name appropriately enclosed in brackets, such as
<tt class="literal">&lt;head&gt;</tt> and <tt class="literal">&lt;i&gt;</tt>.
More complicated tags contain one or more
<em class="emphasis">attributes</em>, which specify or modify the behavior
of the tag.</p>

<p>According to the HTML standard, tag and attribute names are not
case-sensitive. There's no difference in effect between
<tt class="literal">&lt;head&gt;</tt>, <tt class="literal">&lt;Head&gt;</tt>,
<tt class="literal">&lt;HEAD&gt;</tt>, or even
<tt class="literal">&lt;HeaD&gt;</tt>; they are all equivalent. With XHTML,
case <em class="emphasis">is</em> important: all current standard tag and
attribute names are in lowercase.
</p>

<p>For both HTML and XHTML, the values that you assign to a particular
attribute may be case-sensitive, depending on your browser and
server. In particular, file location and name references -- or
uniform resource locators (URLs) -- are case-sensitive. <a href="ch06_02.htm">Section 6.2, "Referencing Documents: The URL"</a>
</p>

<p>Tag attributes, if any, belong after the tag name, each separated by
one or more tab, space, or return characters. Their order of
appearance is not important.
</p>

<p>A tag attribute's value, if any, follows an
<a name="INDEX-292" /> <a name="INDEX-293" />equal sign (=) after the attribute
name. You may include spaces around the equal sign, so that
<tt class="literal">width=6</tt>, <tt class="literal">width = 6</tt>,
<tt class="literal">width =6</tt>, and <tt class="literal">width= 6</tt> all mean
the same. For <a name="INDEX-294" />
<a name="INDEX-295" />readability, however, we prefer not to
include spaces. That way, it's easier to pick out an
attribute/value pair from a crowd of pairs in a lengthy tag.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-296" /> <a name="INDEX-297" />With HTML, if an
attribute's value is a single word or number (no spaces), you
may simply add it after the equal sign. All other values should be
enclosed in single or double quotation marks, especially those values
that contain several words separated by spaces. With XHTML, all
attribute values must be enclosed in double-quotes. The length of the
value is limited to 1024 characters.
</p>

<p>Most browsers are tolerant of how tags are punctuated and broken
across lines. Nonetheless, avoid breaking tags across lines in your
source document whenever possible. This rule promotes readability and
reduces potential errors in your HTML documents.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-3-SECT-3.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.2. Sample Tags</h3>

<p>Here are some tags with attributes: </p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog.html"&gt;
&lt;ul compact&gt;
&lt;ul compact="compact"&gt;
&lt;input type=text name=filename size=24 maxlength=80&gt;
&lt;link title="Table of Contents"&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The first example is the <tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt> tag for a
hyperlink to O'Reilly &amp; Associates' World Wide
Web-based catalog of products. It has a single attribute,
<tt class="literal">href</tt>, followed by the catalog's address in
cyberspace -- its URL.
</p>

<p>The second example shows an HTML tag that formats text into an
unordered list of items. Its single
attribute -- <tt class="literal">compact</tt>, which limits the space
between list items -- does not require a value.
</p>

<p>The third example demonstrates how the second example must be written
in XHTML. Notice the <tt class="literal">compact</tt> attribute now has a
value, albeit redundant, and that its value is enclosed in double
quotes.
</p>

<p>The fourth example shows an HTML tag with multiple attributes, each
with a value that does not require enclosing quotation marks. Of
course, with XHTML, each attribute value must be enclosed in double
quotes.
</p>

<p>The last example shows proper use of enclosing quotation marks when
the attribute value is more than one word long.
</p>

<p>What is not immediately evident in these examples is that while HTML
attribute names are not case-sensitive (<tt class="literal">href</tt> works
the same as <tt class="literal">HREF</tt> and <tt class="literal">HreF</tt> in
HTML), most attribute values are case-sensitive. The value
<tt class="literal">filename</tt> for the <tt class="literal">name</tt> attribute
in the <tt class="literal">&lt;input&gt;</tt> tag example is not the same
as the value <tt class="literal">Filename</tt>, for instance.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-3-SECT-3.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.3. Starting and Ending Tags</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-298" /> <a name="INDEX-299" /> <a name="INDEX-300" />We alluded earlier to the fact
that most tags have a beginning and an end and affect the portion of
content between them. That enclosed segment may be large or small,
from a single text character, syllable, or word, such as the
italicized "simp" syllable in our barebones example, to
the <tt class="literal">&lt;html&gt;</tt> tag that bounds the entire
document. The starting component of any tag is the tag name and its
attributes, if any. The corresponding ending tag is the tag name
alone, preceded by a slash. Ending tags have no attributes.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-3-SECT-3.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.4. Proper and Improper Nesting</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-301" />
<a name="INDEX-302" />Tags can be put inside the affected
segment of another tag (nested) for multiple tag effects on a single
segment of the document. For example, a portion of the following text
is both bold and included as part of an anchor defined by the
<tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt> tag:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;body&gt;
This is some text in the body, with a
&lt;a href="another_doc.html"&gt;link, a portion of which
is &lt;b&gt;set in bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>According to the HTML and XHTML standards, you must end nested tags
starting with the most recent one and work your way back out. For
instance in the example, we end the bold tag
(<tt class="literal">&lt;/b&gt;</tt>) before ending the link tag
(<tt class="literal">&lt;/a&gt;</tt>) since we started in the reverse
order: <tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt> tag first, then
<tt class="literal">&lt;b&gt;</tt> tag. It's a good idea to follow
that standard, even though most browsers don't absolutely
insist you do so. You may get away with violating this nesting rule
for one browser, sometimes even with all current browsers. But
eventually a new browser version won't allow the violation and
you'll be hard pressed to straighten out your source HTML
document. And, be aware that the XHTML standard explicitly forbids
improper nesting.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-3-SECT-3.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.5. Tags Without Ends</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-303" />According to the HTML standard, a few
tags do not have an ending tag. In fact, the standard forbids use of
an end tag for these special ones, although most browsers are lenient
and ignore the errant end tag. For example, the
<tt class="literal">&lt;br&gt;</tt> tag causes a line break; it has no
effect otherwise on the subsequent portion of the document and,
hence, does not need an ending tag.
</p>

<p>The HTML tags that do not have a corresponding end tags are:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;area&gt;
&lt;base&gt;
&lt;basefont&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;col&gt;
&lt;frame&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img&gt;
&lt;input&gt;
&lt;isindex&gt;
&lt;link&gt;
&lt;meta&gt;
&lt;param&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="INDEX-304" />XHTML always requires end tags. <a href="ch16_03.htm">Section 16.3.3, "Handling Empty Elements"</a><a name="INDEX-305" /> <a name="INDEX-306" />
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-3-SECT-3.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.6. Omitting Tags</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-307" />
<a name="INDEX-308" />
<a name="INDEX-309" /> <a name="INDEX-310" />You often
see documents in which the author seemingly has forgotten to include
an ending tag in apparent violation of the HTML standard. Sometimes
you even see a missing <tt class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</tt> tag. But your
browser doesn't complain, and the document displays just fine.
What gives? The HTML standard lets you omit certain tags or their
endings for clarity and ease of preparation. The HTML standard
writers didn't intend the language to be tedious.
</p>

<p>For example, the <tt class="literal">&lt;p&gt;</tt> tag that defines the
start of a paragraph has a corresponding end tag
<tt class="literal">&lt;/p&gt;</tt>, but the <tt class="literal">&lt;/p&gt;</tt>
ending tag rarely is used. In fact, many HTML authors don't
even know it exists! <a href="ch04_01.htm">Section 4.1.2, "The &lt;p&gt; Tag"</a>
</p>

<p>Rather, the HTML standard lets you omit a starting tag or ending tag
whenever it can be unambiguously inferred by the surrounding context.
Many browsers make good guesses when confronted with missing tags,
leading the document author to assume that a valid omission was made.
</p>

<p>We recommend that you most always add the ending tag. It'll
make life easier for yourself as you transition to XHTML, as well as
on the browser and anyone who might need to modify your document in
the future.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-3-SECT-3.7" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.3.7. Ignored or Redundant Tags</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-311" /> <a name="INDEX-312" /> <a name="INDEX-313" />HTML browsers sometimes ignore tags. This
usually happens with redundant tags whose effects merely cancel or
substitute for themselves. The best example is a series of
<tt class="literal">&lt;p&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-314" /> tags, one after the other with no
intervening content. Unlike the similar series of repeating return
characters in a text-processing document, most browsers skip to a new
line only once. The extra <tt class="literal">&lt;p&gt;</tt> tags are
redundant and usually ignored by the browser.
</p>

<p>In addition, most HTML browsers ignore any tag that they don't
understand or that was incorrectly specified by the document author.
Browsers habitually forge ahead and make some sense of a document, no
matter how badly formed and error-ridden it may be. This isn't
just a tactic to overcome errors; it's also an important
strategy for extensibility. Imagine how much harder it would be to
add new features to the language if the existing base of browsers
choked on them.
</p>

<p>The thing to watch out for with nonstandard tags that aren't
supported by most browsers is their enclosed contents, if any.
Browsers that recognize the new tag may process those contents
differently than those that don't support the new tag. For
example, Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator now both support
the <tt class="literal">&lt;style&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-315" /> tag, whose contents serve to set the
variety of display characteristics of your document. However,
previous versions of the popular browsers, many of which are still in
use by many people today, don't support styles. Hence, older
browsers ignore the <tt class="literal">&lt;style&gt;</tt> tag and render
its contents on the user's screen, effectively defeating the
tag's purpose in addition to ruining <a name="INDEX-316" />the document's
appearance. <a href="ch08_01.htm">Section 8.1.2, "Document-Level Style Sheets"</a>
