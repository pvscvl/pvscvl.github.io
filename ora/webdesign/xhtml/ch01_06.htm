<h2 class="sect1">1.6. Nonstandard Extensions</h2>

<p>It doesn't take an advanced degree in the <a name="INDEX-68" /> <a name="INDEX-69" />obvious to know that many people vie for
distinction to draw the attentions of others. So, too, with browsers.
Extra whizbang features can give the edge in the otherwise
standardized market. That can be a nightmare for authors. A lot of
people want you to use the latest and greatest gimmick or even useful
HTML extension. But it's not part of the standard, and not all
browsers support it. In fact, on occasion, the popular browsers
support different ways of doing the same thing.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.6.1. Extensions: Pro and Con</h3>

<p>Every software vendor adheres to the technological standards;
it's embarrassing to be incompatible and your competitors will
take every opportunity to remind buyers of your product's
failure to comply, no matter how arcane or useless that standard
might be. At the same time, vendors seek to make their products
different and better than the competition's offerings.
Netscape's and Internet Explorer's extensions to standard
HTML are perfect examples of these market pressures.
</p>

<p>Many document authors feel safe using these extended browsers'
nonstandard extensions because of their combined and commanding share
of users. For better or worse, extensions to HTML made by the folks
at Netscape or Microsoft instantly become part of the street version
of the language, much like English slang creeping into the vocabulary
of most Frenchmen, despite all the best efforts of the
Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise.
</p>

<p>Fortunately, with HTML Version 4.0, the W3C standards caught up with
the browser manufacturers. In fact, the tables turned somewhat. The
many extensions to HTML that originally appeared as extensions in
Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer are now part of the HTML 4
and XHTML 1.0 standards, and there are other parts of the new
standard that are not yet features of the popular browsers.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.6.2. Avoiding Extensions</h3>

<p>In general, we urge you to resist using an extension unless you have
a compelling and overriding reason to do so. By using them,
particularly in key portions of your documents, you run the risk of
losing a substantial portion of your potential readership. Sure, the
Internet Explorer community is large enough to make this point moot
now, but even so, you are excluding several million people who use
Netscape from your pages.
</p>

<p>Of course, there are varying degrees of dependency on extensions. If
you use some of the horizontal rule extensions, for example, most
other browsers will ignore the extended attributes and render a
conventional horizontal rule. On the other hand, reliance upon a
number of font size changes and text alignment extensions to control
your document appearance will make your document look terrible on
many alternative browsers. It might not even display at all on
browsers that don't support the extensions.
</p>

<p>We admit that it is disingenuous of us to decry the use of extensions
while presenting complete descriptions of their use. In keeping with
the general philosophy of the Internet, we'll err on the side
of handing out rope and guns to all interested parties while hoping
you have enough smarts to keep from hanging yourself or shooting
yourself in the foot.
</p>

<p>Our advice still holds, though: only use an extension where it is
necessary or very advantageous, and do so with the understanding that
you are disenfranchising a portion of your audience. To that end, you
might even consider providing separate, standards-based versions of
your documents to accommodate users of other browsers.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-6.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.6.3. Beyond Extensions: Exploiting Bugs</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-70" />It is one thing
to take advantage of an extension, and it is quite another to exploit
known bugs in a particular version of a browser in order to achieve
some unusual document effect.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-71" />
<a name="INDEX-72" /> <a name="INDEX-73" />A good example is the multiple-body bug
in Version 1.1 of Netscape Navigator. The HTML standard insists that
a compliant document have exactly one <tt class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</tt>
tag, containing the body of the document. The now-obsolete browser
allowed any number of <tt class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</tt> tags,
processing and rendering each <tt class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</tt> in
turn. By placing several <tt class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</tt> tags in an
HTML document, an author could achieve crude animation effects when
the document was first loaded into the browser. The most popular
trick used several <tt class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</tt> tags, each with a
slightly different background color. This trick results in a document
fade-in effect.
</p>

<p>The party ended when Version 1.2 of Netscape fixed the bug. Suddenly,
thousands of documents lost their fancy fade-in effect. Although
faced with some rather fierce complaints, to their credit, the people
at Netscape stood by their decision to adhere to the standard,
placing compliance higher on their list of priorities than nifty
rendering hacks.
</p>
<p>In that light, we can unequivocally offer this advice: <em class="emphasis">never</em> exploit a bug in a browser to achieve a particular effect in your documents.<a name="INDEX-74" />
