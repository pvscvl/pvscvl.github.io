<h2 class="sect1">1.7. Tools for the Web Designer</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-76" /> <a name="INDEX-77" />
<a name="INDEX-78" />While you can use the barest of
barebones text editors to create HTML and XHTML documents, most
authors have a bit more elaborate toolbox of software utilities than
a simple word processor. You also need a browser, so you can test and
refine your work. Beyond the essentials are some specialized software
tools for HTML document preparation and editing, and others for
developing and preparing accessory multimedia files.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-7.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.7.1. Essentials</h3>

<p>At the very least, you'll need an editor, a browser to check
your work, and ideally, a connection to the Internet.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-7.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.7.1.1. Word processor or WYSIWYG editor?</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-79" /> <a name="INDEX-80" /> <a name="INDEX-81" />Some authors
use the word-processing capabilities of their specialized HTML/XHTML
editing software. Others use the WYSIWYG
(what-you-see-is-what-you-get) composition tools that come with their
browser or the latest versions of the popular word processors.
Others, such as ourselves, prefer to compose their work on a general
word processor and later insert the markup tags and their attributes.
Still others include markup as they compose.
</p>

<p>We think the stepwise approach -- compose, then mark up -- is
the better way. We find that once we've defined and written the
document's content, it's much easier to make a second
pass to judiciously and effectively add the HTML/XHTML tags to format
the text. Otherwise, the markup can obscure the content. Note, too,
that unless specially trained (if they can be), spellcheckers and
thesauruses typically choke on markup tags and their various
parameters. You can spend what seems to be a lifetime clicking the
Ignore button on all those otherwise valid markup tags when syntax-
or spell-checking a document.
</p>

<p>When and how you embed markup tags into your document dictates the
tools you need. We recommend that you use a good word processor, such
as WordPerfect or Word, which comes with more and better writing
tools than simple text editors or the browser-based markup-language
editors. You'll find, for instance, that an outliner,
spellchecker, and thesaurus will best help you craft the
document's flow and content well, disregarding for the moment
its look. The latest word processors encode your documents with HTML,
too, but don't expect miracles. Except for boilerplate
documents, you will probably need to nurse those automated HTML
documents to full health. And it'll be a while before
you'll see XHTML-specific markup tools in the popular word
processors.
</p>

<p>Another word of caution about automated composition tools: they
typically change or insert content, such as replacing relative
hyperlinks with full ones, and arrange your document in ways that
will annoy you. Annoying, in particular, since they rarely give you
the opportunity to do things your own way.
</p>

<p>So become fluent in native HTML/XHTML. Be prepared to reverse some of
the things a composition tool will do to your documents. And make
sure you can wrest your document away from the tool so you can make
it do your bidding.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-7.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.7.1.2. Browser software</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-82" />
<a name="INDEX-83" /> <a name="INDEX-84" />Obviously, you should
view your newly composed documents and test their functionality
before you release them for use by others. For serious authors,
particularly those looking to push their documents beyond the
HTML/XHTML standards, we recommend that you have several browser
products, perhaps with versions running on different computers, just
to be sure one's delightful display isn't another's
nightmare.
</p>

<p>The currently popular -- and therefore most
important -- browsers are <a name="INDEX-85" />Netscape
Navigator (the browser portion of Netscape Communicator) and
Microsoft's <a name="INDEX-86" />
<a name="INDEX-87" />
<a name="INDEX-88" />Internet Explorer. Download the latest
versions from their web sites.
</p>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-7.1.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.7.1.3. Internet connection</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-89" /> <a name="INDEX-90" />We think you should have bona fide
access to the Internet if you are really serious about learning and
honing your document markup skills. Okay, it's not absolutely
essential, since you can compose and view documents locally. And for
some, a connection is perhaps not even possible or practical, but
make the effort: sometimes there's no better way to learn than
by example. Examples both good and bad abound on the Internet, and
there are literally millions of Web pages whose source HTML you can
download and examine, albeit fewer XHTML ones.
</p>

<p>Moreover, an Internet connection <em class="emphasis">is</em> essential
for development and testing if you include hypertext links to
Internet services in your web documents. Most of all, an Internet
connection gives you access to a wealth of tips and ongoing updates
to the language through special-interest newsgroups, as well as much
of the essential and accessory software you can use to prepare
document collections.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.7.2. An Extended Toolkit</h3>

<p>If you're serious about creating documents, you'll soon
find there are all sorts of nifty tools that make life easier. The
list of freeware, shareware, and commercial products grows daily, so
it's not very useful to provide a list here. This is, in fact,
another good reason why you should get an Internet connection;
various groups keep updated lists of HTML and XHTML resources on the
Web. If you are really dedicated to writing in HTML and XHTML, you
will visit those sites, and you will visit them regularly to keep
abreast of the language, tools, and trends.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-91" /> <a name="INDEX-92" />
<a name="INDEX-93" />We think the following four web sites are
the most useful for authors. Each contains dozens, sometimes
hundreds, of hyperlinks to detailed descriptions of products and
other important information. Go at it:
</p>

<blockquote class="simplelist">

<p><a href="../../../../../../www.stars.com/">http://www.stars.com</a></p>

<p><a href="../../../../../../msdn.microsoft.com/">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a></p>

<p><a href="../../../../../../search.netscape.com/">http://search.netscape.com</a></p>

<p><a href="../../../../../../www.w3.org/MarkUp">http://www.w3.org/MarkUp</a><a name="INDEX-94" />
<a name="INDEX-95" /></p>
