<h2 class="sect1">17.5. Transparent Images</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-2793" />
<a name="INDEX-2794" />One
of the most popular tricks you'll find on almost
everyone's web pages is the transparent image. Transparent
images let the background show through, giving the remainder of the
image the appearance of floating on the page. The effect is clever,
and it is the only way to put nonrectangular images into your
document displays. <a href="ch05_02.htm">Section 5.2.1, "Understanding Image Formats"</a>
</p>

<p>Creating a transparent image is easy, once you understand how the
process works and which images are candidates for transparency.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-17-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.5.1. Colors, Maps, and Indexes</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2795" />Images represent
their colors in one of two ways: directly or through a
<em class="emphasis">colormap</em>.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2796" />
<a name="INDEX-2797" />
<a name="INDEX-2798" />In the direct method, each pixel in the
image contains the actual RGB values that define the color of that
pixel. Such images are often called <em class="emphasis">true color</em>
images, since the number of distinct colors in the image is generally
quite large. It is often the case that very few pixels in a true
color image share the same color, with many pixels having subtly
different variations of the same color. The most popular image format
using this representation method is the JPEG format.
</p>

<p>Colormap-based images keep all the different colors used in the image
in a table known as the colormap. Each pixel in the image contains an
index into the table of that pixel's color. In general, the
table is fairly small, usually less than 256 colors. This means that
many pixels share the same color, and that whole groups of pixels can
have their color changed by simply altering the appropriate entry in
the colormap. The most common image format using colormaps is the GIF
format.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2799" />Image
transparency is only possible with images containing a colormap and
is currently defined only for images using the GIF89a format. In this
format, one entry in the colormap is tagged as the transparent color.
All pixels containing the index of that entry will be made
transparent when the image is displayed.
</p>

<p>For example, consider an image containing eight colors. The colormap
is eight entries long, with indices numbered zero through seven. Each
pixel in the image contains a value from zero to seven, corresponding
to its color in the colormap. If you indicate that the second entry
in the color map, whose index is one, will be transparent, all pixels
with the value one will be made transparent when the image is
rendered.

<h3 class="sect2">17.5.2. Creating a Potentially Transparent Image</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2800" />The cookbook way to
create a transparent image is easy: take a conventional image,
determine the color to be made transparent, and convert the image to
GIF89a format, marking that color as transparent.
</p>

<p>The most difficult part for most people is finding a conventional
image that is suitable for conversion. To make the background of an
image transparent, the <em class="emphasis">entire</em> background must be
one color. Unfortunately, many images do not meet this simple
criteria. Scanned images, for example, usually have backgrounds that
are a mix of several slightly different shades of one color. Since
only one color can be made transparent, the result is a mottled
background, part transparent and part opaque.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2801" />
<a name="INDEX-2802" />Many image-editing
tools use a process known as <em class="emphasis">dithering</em> to create
certain colors in an image. Dithered colors are not pure, but are a
mix of several other colors. This mixture is not amenable to
transparency. You'll often find dithering used on systems with
small colormaps, like conventional 16-color VGA displays on some PCs.
</p>

<p>Finally, some images have a pure background color, but that color is
also used in parts of the image you want to keep opaque. Since every
pixel having the appropriate colormap index is made transparent,
these portions of the image become transparent as well.
</p>

<p>In all cases, the problem can be solved by loading the image into an
image editor, turning off dithering, and painting the background
areas, usually by hand, to be a single color not used anywhere else
in the image. Make sure you save the result as a GIF image, so that
the colormap and pixel indexes will be retained.

<h3 class="sect2">17.5.3. Converting the Image</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2803" />
<a name="INDEX-2804" />Once you have an acceptable image, and
you've determined the color you wish to make transparent,
you'll need to convert the image to GIF89a format.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2805" />For PC and
Unix users, a public-domain utility called
<em class="emphasis">giftrans</em> does the job nicely. To convert an
image, use this command:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">giftrans -t<em class="replaceable"> index original.gif &gt; new.gif</em></pre></blockquote>

<p>Replace <em class="emphasis">index</em> with the numeric index of the
color to be made transparent. <em class="emphasis">Original.gif</em> and
<em class="emphasis">new.gif</em> are the original nontransparent image
and the resulting transparent image.
</p>

<p>Apple Macintosh users have the advantage, though: they can use a
single tool named
<em class="emphasis">Transparency</em><a name="INDEX-2806" /> to accomplish the conversion.
It was written by Aaron <a name="INDEX-2807" />Giles at Cornell University, who
generously makes it available at no charge over the Internet. Try
searching for it on the Web.
</p>

<p>Finally, several commercial products let you create transparent and
interlaced GIF images, including Adobe PhotoShop and PaintShop Pro.
Of course, these tools can do far more than simply convert
transparent images. For a complete discussion of transparency and
image conversion, including links to the actual tools, visit:
