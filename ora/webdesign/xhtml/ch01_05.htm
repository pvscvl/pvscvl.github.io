<h2 class="sect1">1.5. HTML and XHTML: What They Aren't</h2>

<p>With all their multimedia-enabling, new page layout features, and the
hot technologies that give life to <a name="INDEX-61" /> <a name="INDEX-62" />HTML/XHTML documents over the
Internet, it is also important to understand the languages'
limitations. They are not word-processing tools, desktop publishing
solutions, or even programming languages. That's because their
fundamental purpose is to define the structure and appearance of
documents and document families so that they may be delivered quickly
and easily to a user over a network for rendering on a variety of
display devices. Jack of all trades, but master of none, so to speak.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.5.1. Content Versus Appearance</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-63" /> <a name="INDEX-64" />
<a name="INDEX-65" />
<a name="INDEX-66" />Before you can fully
appreciate the power of the language and begin creating effective
documents, you must yield to one fundamental rule. These markup
languages are designed to structure documents and make their content
more accessible, not to format documents for display purposes.
</p>

<p>HTML and its progeny XHTML do provide many different ways to let you
define the appearance of your documents: font specifications, line
breaks, and multicolumn text are all features of the language. And,
of course, appearance is important, since it can have either
detrimental or beneficial effects on how users access and use the
information in your documents.
</p>

<p>But with HTML and XHTML, content is paramount; appearance is
secondary, particularly since it is less predictable, given the
variety of browser graphics and text-formatting capabilities.
Besides, these markup languages contain many more ways for
structuring your document content without regard to the final
appearance: section headers, structured lists, paragraphs, rules,
titles, and embedded images are all defined by the standard languages
without regard for how these elements might be rendered by a browser.
Consider, for example, a browser for the blind, wherein graphics on
the page come with audio descriptions and alternative rules for
navigation. The HTML 4 standard defines such a thing: content over
visual presentation.
</p>

<p>If you treat HTML or XHTML as a document-generation tool, you will be
sorely disappointed in your ability to format your document in a
specific way. There is simply not enough capability built into the
languages to allow you to create the kind of documents you might whip
up with tools like FrameMaker or Microsoft Word. Attempts to subvert
the supplied structuring elements to achieve specific formatting
tricks seldom work across all browsers. In short, don't waste
your time trying to force HTML and XHTML to do things they were never
designed to do.
</p>

<p>Instead, use HTML and XHTML in the manner for which they were
designed: indicating the structure of a document so that the browser
can then render its content appropriately. HTML and XHTML are rife
with tags that let you indicate the semantics of your document
content, something that is missing from tools like Frame or Word.
Create your documents using these tags and you'll be happier,
your documents will look better, and your readers <a name="INDEX-67" />will benefit
immensely.
