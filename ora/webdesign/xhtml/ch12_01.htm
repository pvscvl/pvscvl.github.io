developments in web technologies is the ability to deliver
applications directly to the user's browser. These typically
small programs, which are known as <em class="emphasis">applets</em>,
perform simple tasks on the client computer, from responding to user
mouse- or keyboard-actions to spicing up your web page displays with
multimedia-enabling software.
</p>
<p>You may embed applets into your documents using a special programming language known as JavaScript. Or you can load and execute Java-based, platform-independent applets over the Internet. During execution, these programs may generate dynamic content, interact with the user, validate form data, or even create windows and run entire applications independent of your pages. The possibilities are endless, and they go far beyond the document model that was originally envisioned for HTML. </p>


<p>In this chapter, we show you, with simple examples, how to embed and
include executable content -- scripts and applets -- in your
documents. We won't, however, even begin to pretend to teach
you how to write and debug your own applets. This is a book about
HTML and XTHML, after all. Rather, get an expert opinion: turn to any
of the many excellent texts from O'Reilly, including
<em class="emphasis">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em>, by David
Flanagan, <em class="emphasis">Java in a Nutshell</em>, by David Flanagan,
and <em class="emphasis">Exploring Java,</em> Pat Niemeyer and Josh Peck.

<h2 class="sect1">12.1. Applets and Objects</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-2273" />
<a name="INDEX-2274" />Applets,
like client-side image maps, represent a shift in the basic model of
web communications. Until recently, servers performed most of the
computational work on the Web, client browsers being not much more
than glorified terminals. With applets, web technology is shifting
toward the client, distributing some or all of the computational load
from the server to the client and its browser.
</p>
<p>Applets also represent a way of extending a browser's features without forcing users to purchase or otherwise acquire a new browser, as is the case when developers implement new tag and attribute extensions to HTML. Nor do users have to acquire and install a special application, as is required for helper or plug-in applications. This means that once users have a browser that supports applets (Netscape and Internet Explorer do), you can deliver applets immediately, including display and multimedia innovations. </p>

<a name="html4-CHP-12-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.1.1. The Object Model</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2275" /> <a name="INDEX-2276" />Java-based applets -- web
page-referenced programs retrieved from a network server and executed
on the user's client computer -- actually are a subset of
what the HTML 4 and XHTML standards call
<em class="emphasis">inclusions</em><a name="INDEX-2277" />.
As with images, the browser first loads the HTML document, then
examines it for inclusions -- additional, separate, and discrete
content that is to be handled by the client browser. A GIF image is
one type of inclusion. A <em class="filename">.wav</em> sound file is
another; an MPEG movie is another; a Java-based clock program is
another.
</p>

<p>The HTML 4 and XHTML standards generally calls the inclusion contents
<em class="emphasis">objects</em>. In fact, in your document you may
identify and load nearly any object file over the network through a
universal <tt class="literal">&lt;object&gt;</tt> tag, which we discuss in
detail later in this chapter. <a href="ch12_02.htm">Section 12.2.1, "The &lt;object&gt; Tag"</a>
</p>

<p>Once downloaded, the standards dictate that the browser somehow
render the object, by internal or external mechanisms. The popular
graphical browsers, for instance, have integrated software for
displaying GIF and JPEG images. Otherwise, plug-ins and other helper
applications may provide the necessary rendering mechanism.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-12-SECT-1.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.1.1.1. The applet model</h3>

<p>With applet-based objects, the browser sets aside a portion of the
document display space. You may control the size and position of this
display area; the applet controls what is presented inside.
</p>

<p>The applet object is software, an executable program. Accordingly,
besides providing a display space, the browser, in tandem with the
client computer environment and resources, provides the applet
runtime environment -- typically Java.
</p>

<p>During execution, the applet has access to a restricted environment
within the user's computer. For instance, applets have access
to the mouse and keyboard and may receive input from the user. They
can initiate network connections and retrieve data from other servers
on the Internet. In sum, applets are full-fledged programs, complete
with a variety of input and output mechanisms, along with a full
suite of network services.
</p>

<p>Several applets may be placed in a single document; they all execute
in parallel and may communicate with each other. While the browser
may limit their access to its computer system, applets have complete
control of their virtual environment within the browser.
</p>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-12-SECT-1.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.1.1.2. The applet advantage</h3>

<p>There are several advantages of applets, not the least of which is
providing more compelling user interfaces within a web page. For
instance, an applet might create a unique set of menus, choices, text
fields, and similar user-input tools different from those available
through the browser. When the user clicks a button within the
applet's interaction/display region, the applet might respond
by displaying results within the region, signaling another applet, or
even by loading a completely new page into the browser.
</p>

<p>We don't mean to imply that the only use of applets is to
enhance the user interface. An applet is a full-fledged program that
can perform any number of computational and user-interactive tasks on
the client computer. An applet might implement a real-time video
display, perform circuit simulation, engage the user in a game,
provide a chat interface, and so on.
</p>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-12-SECT-1.1.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.1.1.3. Using applets correctly</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2278" />An
applet is nothing more than another tool you may use to produce
compelling and useful web pages. Keep in mind that an applet uses
computational resources on the client to run and therefore places a
load on the user's computer. It can degrade system
<a name="INDEX-2279" />performance.
</p>

<p>Similarly, if an applet uses a lot of network bandwidth to accomplish
its task (a real-time video feed, for example), it may make other
network communication unbearably slow. While such applications are
fun, they do little more than annoy your target audience.
</p>

<p>To use an applet correctly, balance the load between the browser and
the server. For each page, decide which tasks are best left to the
server (forms processing, index searches, and the like) and which
tasks are better suited for local processing (user interface
enhancements, real-time data presentation, small animations, input
validation, and so on). Divide the processing accordingly. Remember
that many users have slower network connections and computers than
you do and design your applets to satisfy the majority of your
audience.
</p>

<p>Used the right way, applets seamlessly enhance your pages and provide
a satisfying experience for your audience. Used improperly, applets
are just another annoying bandwidth waster, alienating your users and
hurting your pages.
</p>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-12-SECT-1.1.4" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.1.1.4. Writing applets</h3>

<p>Creating applets is a programming task, not usually a job for the
HTML or XHTML author, and certainly well beyond the scope of this
book. For details, we recommend you consult any of the many applet
programming texts that have recently appeared on bookshelves
everywhere, including those from O'Reilly &amp; Associates.
</p>

<p>Today, one language dominates the applet programming world:
<a name="INDEX-2280" />Java.
Developed by Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, California, Java
supports an object-oriented programming style wherein classes of
applets can be used and reused to build complex applications.
</p>

<p>By invention, applets built from the same language should run with
any browser that supports them. In reality, certain Microsoft
implementation decisions had caused some valid Java applets to fail
when running on earlier versions of Internet Explorer. Microsoft has
fixed these problems with Internet Explorer Version 5 and Java will
remain a universal programming language for the Web. In any case, the
conscientious Java programmer should keep abreast of the latest
technology and create applets that are certifiably 100% pure Java.
Microsoft, in particular, is trying to get programmers to use
proprietary extensions to Java that will work on only Microsoft
platforms and is refusing to support key parts of the standard. We
recommend avoiding any vendor extensions to Java that deviate from
the standard Java 1.1 version.
</p>

<p>You can shield yourself from platform dependencies by using the Java
Plugin from Sun; see <a href="../../../../../../java.sun.com/products/plugin">http://java.sun.com/products/plugin</a>. There
are versions for both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.
Currently, the plugin is the only way to get support for the latest
version of Java (Java 2 SDK 1.3).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-66">[66]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-66" /><p>[66] The plugin has
achieved some acceptance for running Java 2 applets in intranet
(i.e., corporate network) environments, but we have yet to see an
applet on the public Internet that required Java 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We should take this opportunity to also <a name="INDEX-2281" />mention ActiveX, an alternative
applet programming technology available from Microsoft. ActiveX is
proprietary, closely coupled with various versions of Microsoft
Windows, and works only when used with <a name="INDEX-2282" />Internet Explorer. ActiveX applets will
run on versions of Internet Explorer targeted to various versions of
Windows, but a single ActiveX applet will not run on these different
versions without recompilation. This is in contrast with Java
applets, where a single Java applet can be written and compiled once
and immediately run on a broad range of browsers and operating
systems.
</p>
<p>ActiveX also presents an unacceptably high <a name="INDEX-2283" />security risk to any user whose browser supports ActiveX technology. It is ridiculously easy to penetrate and damage a computer running a browser that allows ActiveX applets to be executed. For this reason, we cannot recommend ActiveX as a viable applet implementation technology and we go so far as to recommend that users disable ActiveX capability within their browsers -- specifically, Internet <a name="INDEX-2284" />

<a name="INDEX-2287" />
