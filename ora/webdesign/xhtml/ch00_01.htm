<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>

<p>Learning Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Hypertext
Markup Language (XHTML) is like learning any new language, computer
or human. Most students first immerse themselves in examples.
Studying others is a natural way to learn, making learning easy and
fun. Our advice to anyone wanting to learn HTML and XHTML is to get
out there on the World Wide Web with a suitable browser and see for
yourself what looks good, what's effective, what works for you.
Examine others' documents and ponder the possibilities. Mimicry
is how many of the current webmasters have learned the language.
</p>

<p>Imitation can take you only so far, though. Examples can be both good
and bad. Learning by example will help you talk the talk, but not
walk the walk. To become truly conversant, you must learn how to use
the language appropriately in many different situations. You could
learn all that by example, if you live long enough.
</p>

<p>Remember, too, that computer-based languages are more explicit than
human languages. You've got to get the language syntax correct
or it won't work. Then, too, there is the problem of
"standards." Committees of academics and industry experts
define the proper syntax and usage of a computer language like HTML.
The problem is that browser manufacturers like Netscape
Communications Corporation (now an America Online company) and
Microsoft Corporation choose the parts of the standard they will use
and which parts they will ignore. They even make up their own parts,
which may eventually become standards.
</p>

<p>Standards change, too. As we write this current edition, HTML is
undergoing a conversion into XHTML, making it an application of the
Extensible Markup Language (XML). HTML and XHTML are so similar that
we often refer to them as a single language. But there are key
differences; more about this later in the preface.
</p>

<p>To be safe, the way to become fluent in HTML and XHTML is through a
comprehensive, up-to-date language reference that covers the language
syntax, semantics, and variations in detail to help you distinguish
between good and bad usage.
</p>

<p>There's one more step leading to fluency in a language. To
become a true master of the language, you need to develop your own
style. That means knowing not only what is appropriate, but what is
effective. Layout matters. A lot. So does the order of presentation
within a document, between documents, and between document
collections.
</p>

<p>Our goal in writing this book is to help you become fluent in HTML
and XHTML, fully versed in their syntax, semantics, and elements of
style. We take the natural learning approach, using examples: good
ones, of course. We cover every element of the currently accepted
versions (HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0) of the languages in detail, as
well as all of the current extensions supported by the popular
browsers, explaining how each element works and how it interacts with
all the other elements.
</p>

<p>And, with all due respect to Strunk and White, throughout the book we
will give you suggestions for style and composition to help you
decide how best to use HTML and XHTML to accomplish a variety of
tasks, from simple online documentation to complex marketing and
sales presentations. We'll show you what works and what
doesn't, what makes sense to those who view your pages, and
what might be confusing.
</p>

<p>In short, this book is a complete guide to creating documents using
HTML and XHTML, starting with basic syntax and semantics, and
finishing with broad style guidelines to help you create beautiful,
informative, accessible documents that you'll be proud to
deliver to your browsers.

<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Our Audience</h2>

<p>We wrote this book for anyone interested in learning and using the
language of the Web, from the most casual user to the full-time
design professional. We don't expect you to have any experience
in HTML or XHTML before picking up this book. In fact, we don't
even expect that you've ever browsed the World Wide Web,
although we'd be very surprised if you haven't at least
experimented with this technology by now. Being connected to the
Internet is not necessary to use this book, but if you're not
connected, this book becomes like a travel guide for the homebound.
</p>

<p>The only things we ask you to have are a computer, a text editor that
can create simple ASCII text files, and copies of the latest leading
web browsers -- preferably Netscape Navigator and Internet
Explorer. Because HTML and XHTML documents are stored in a
universally accepted format -- ASCII text -- and because the
languages are completely independent of any specific computer, we
won't even make an assumption about the kind of computer
you're using. However, browsers do vary by platform and
operating system, which means that your HTML or XHTML documents can
look quite different depending on the computer and version of
browser. We will explain how the various browsers use certain
language features, paying particular attention to how they are
different.
</p>

<p>If you are new to HTML, the World Wide Web, or hypertext
documentation in general, you should start by reading <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "HTML, XHTML, and the World Wide Web"</a>. In it, we describe how all the World Wide Web
technologies come together to create webs of interrelated documents.
</p>

<p>If you are already familiar with the Web, but not with HTML or XHTML
specifically, or if you are interested in the new features in the
latest standard version of HTML and XHTML, start by reading <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "Quick Start"</a>. This chapter is a brief overview of the most
important features of the language and serves as a roadmap to how we
approach the language in the remainder of the book.
</p>

<p>Subsequent chapters deal with specific language features in a roughly
top-down approach to HTML and XHTML. Read them in order for a
complete tour through the language, or jump around to find the exact
feature you're interested in.
