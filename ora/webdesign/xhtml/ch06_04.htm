<h2 class="sect1">6.4. Creating Effective Links</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-1187" /> <a name="INDEX-1188" />A document becomes hypertext by tossing
in a few links in the same way that water becomes soup when you throw
in a few vegetables. Technically, you've met the goal, but the
outcome may not be very palatable.
</p>

<p>Inserting anchors into your documents is something of an art,
requiring good writing skills, HTML/XHTML prowess, and an
architectural sense of your documents and their relationships to
others on the Web. Effective links flow seamlessly into a document,
quietly supplying additional browsing opportunities to the reader
without disturbing the current document. Poorly designed links scream
out, interrupt the flow of the source document, and generally annoy
the reader.
</p>

<p>While there are as many linking styles as there are authors, here are
a few of the more popular ways to link your documents. All do two
things: they give the reader quick access to related information, and
they tell the reader how the link is related to the current contents.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-6-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.4.1. Lists of Links</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1189" />Perhaps the most common way to
present hyperlinks is in ordered or unordered lists in the style of a
table of contents or list of resources.
</p>

<p>Two schools of style exist. One puts the entire list item into the
source anchor; the other abbreviates the item and puts a shorthand
phrase in the source anchor. In the former, make sure you keep the
anchor content short and sweet; in the latter, use a direct writing
style that makes it easy to embed the link.
</p>

<p>If your list of links becomes overly long, consider organizing it
into several sublists grouped by topic. Readers can then scan the
topics (set off, perhaps, as <tt class="literal">&lt;h3&gt;</tt> headers)
for the appropriate list and then scan that list for the desired
document.
</p>

<p>The alternative list style is much more descriptive, but also more
wordy, so you have to be careful that it doesn't end up
cluttered:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;p&gt;
Kumquat-related documents include:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A concise guide to &lt;a href="kumquat_farming.html"&gt; 
      profitable kumquat farming&lt;/a&gt;,
      including a variety of business plans, lists of fruit
      packing companies, and farming supply companies.
  &lt;li&gt;101 different ways to &lt;a href="kumquat_uses"&gt; 
      use a kumquat&lt;/a&gt;, including stewed kumquats and kumquat pie!
  &lt;li&gt;The kumquat is a hardy tree, but even the greenest of
      thumbs can use a few &lt;a href="news:alt.kumquat_growers"&gt;
      growing tips&lt;/a&gt; to increase
      their yield.
  &lt;li&gt;The business of kumquats is an expanding one, as
      shown by this 10 year overview of the 
      &lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com/kumquat_report/"&gt;
      kumquat industry&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>It sometimes gets hard to read a source HTML document, and it will
become even more tedious with XHTML. Imagine the clutter if
we'd used anchors with fragment identifiers for each of the
subtopics in the list item explanations. Nonetheless, it all looks
pristine and easily navigable when displayed by the browser, such as
with Internet Explorer as shown in <a href="ch06_04.htm">Figure 6-4</a>.
</p>

<p>This more descriptive style of presenting a link list tries hard to
draw readers into the linked document by giving a fuller taste of
what they can expect to find. Because each list element is longer and
requires more scanning by the reader, you should use this style
sparingly and dramatically limit the number of links.
</p>

<p>Use the brief list style when presenting large numbers of links to a
well-informed audience. The second, more descriptive style is better
suited to a smaller number of links for which your readership is less
well-versed in the topic at hand.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-6-FIG-4" /><div class="figure"><img height="216" alt="Figure 6-4" src="figs/xhtm.0604.gif" width="481" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-4. Wordy but effectively descriptive link list</h4>

<a name="html4-CHP-6-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.4.2. Inline References</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1190" />
<a name="INDEX-1191" /> <a name="INDEX-1192" />If you aren't collecting
links into lists, you're probably sprinkling them throughout
your document. So-called inline links are more in keeping with the
true spirit of hypertext, since they enable readers to mark their
current place in the document, visit the related topic in more depth
or find a better explanation, and then come back to the original and
continue reading. That's very personalized information
processing.
</p>

<p>The biggest mistake made by novice authors, however, is to overload
their documents with links and treat them as if they are panic
buttons demanding to be pressed. You may have seen this style of
linking; HTML pages with the word "here" all over the
place, like the panic-ridden example in <a href="ch06_04.htm">Figure 6-5</a>
(we can't bring ourselves to show you the source for this
travesty).
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-6-FIG-5" /><div class="figure"><img height="175" alt="Figure 6-5" src="figs/xhtm.0605.gif" width="481" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-5. Links should not wave and yell like first-graders, "Here! Me! Me!"</h4>

<p>As links, phrases like "click here" and "also
available" are content-free and annoying. They make the person
who is scanning the page for an important link read all the
surrounding text to actually find the reference.
</p>

<p>The better, more refined style for an inline link is to make every
one contain a noun or noun/verb phrase relating to the topic at hand.
Compare how kumquat farming and industry news references are treated
in <a href="ch06_04.htm">Figure 6-6</a> to the "Here! Me! Me!"
example in <a href="ch06_04.htm">Figure 6-5</a>.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-6-FIG-6" /><div class="figure"><img height="180" alt="Figure 6-6" src="figs/xhtm.0606.gif" width="434" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-6. Kinder, gentler inline links work best</h4>

<p>A quick scan of <a href="ch06_04.htm">Figure 6-6</a> immediately yields
useful links to "kumquat farming methods" and
"kumquat industry's past ten years." There is no
need to read the surrounding text to understand where the link will
take you. Indeed, the immediately surrounding content in our example,
as for most inline links, serves only as syntactic sugar in support
of the embedded links.
</p>

<p>Embedding links into the general discourse of a document takes more
effort to create than link lists. You've got to actually
understand the content of the current as well as the target
documents, be able to express that relationship in just a few words,
and then intelligently incorporate that link at some key place in the
source document. Hopefully this key place is where you might expect
the user is ready to interrupt their reading and ask a question or
request more information. To make matters even more difficult,
particularly for the traditional tech writer, this form of
author-reader conversation is most effective when presented in active
voice (he, she, or it does something to an object versus the object
having something done to it). The effort expended is worthwhile,
though, resulting in more informative, easily read documents.
Remember, you'll write the document once, but it will be read
thousands, if not millions, of times. Please your readers,
please.<a name="INDEX-1193" />

<h3 class="sect2">6.4.3. Linking Do's and Don'ts</h3>

<p>Here are some hints for creating links:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Keep the link content as concise as possible</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Long links or huge inline graphic icons for links are visually
disruptive and potentially confusing.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Never place two links immediately adjacent to one another </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Most browsers make it difficult to tell where one link stops and the
next link starts. Separate them with regular text or line breaks.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Be consistent </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>If you are using inline references, make all of your links inline
references. If you choose to use lists of links, stick to either the
short or long form; don't mix styles in a single document.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Try reading your document with all the nonanchor text removed </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>If some links suddenly make no sense, rewrite them so that they stand
on their own. (Many people scan documents looking only for links; the
surrounding text becomes little more than a gray background to the
visually more compelling links.)
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-6-SECT-4.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.4.4. Using Images and Links</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1196" />
<a name="INDEX-1197" />It has become fashionable to use images
and icons instead of words for link contents. For instance, instead
of the word "next," you might use an icon of a little
pointing hand. A link to the home page is not complete without a
picture of a little house. Links to searching tools must now contain
a picture of a magnifying glass, question mark, or binoculars. And
all those flashing, GIF-animated little advertisements!
</p>

<p>Resist falling prey to the "Mount Everest syndrome" of
inserting images simply because you can. Again, it's a matter
of context. If you or your document's readers can't tell
at a glance what relationship a link has with the current document,
you've failed. Use cute images for links sparingly,
consistently, and only in ways that help readers scan your document
for important information and leads. Also be ever mindful that your
pages may be read by someone from nearly anywhere on Earth (perhaps
beyond, even) and that images do not translate consistently across
cultural boundaries. (Ever hear what the "okay" hand sign
common in the United States means to a Japanese person?)
</p>

<p>Creating consistent iconography for a collection of pages is a
daunting task, one that really should be done with the assistance of
someone formally schooled in visual design. Trust us, the kind of
mind that produces nifty code and writes XHTML well is rarely suited
to creating beautiful, compelling imagery. Find a good visual
designer; your pages and readers will benefit immeasurably.
