<h2 class="sect1">15.8. Using XML</h2>

<p>Our address <a name="INDEX-2673" />example
is trivial. It hardly scratches the surface of the wide range of
applications that XML is suited for. To whet your appetite, here are
some common uses for XML that you will certainly be seeing now and in
the future.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-15-SECT-8.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.8.1. Creating Your Own Markup Language</h3>

<p>We touched on this earlier when we mentioned that the latest versions
of HTML are being reformulated as compliant XML DTDs. We cover the
impact XML has on HTML in the next chapter.
</p>

<p>But even more significantly, XML enables communities of users to
create languages that best capture their unique data and ideas.
Mathematicians, chemists, musicians, and professionals from hundreds
of other disciplines can create special tags that represent unique
concepts in a standardized way. Even if no browser exists that can
accurately render these new tags in a displayable form, the ability
to capture and standardize information is tremendously important for
future extraction and interpretation of these ideas.
</p>

<p>For more mainstream XML applications with established audiences, it
is easy to envision custom browsers being created to appropriately
display the new information. Smaller applications or markets may have
more of a challenge creating markup languages that enjoy such wide
acceptance. Creating the custom display tool for a markup language is
difficult; delivering that tool for multiple platforms is expensive.
As we've noted, some of these display concerns can be mitigated
by appropriate use of style sheets. Luckily, XML's capabilities
extend beyond document display.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-15-SECT-8.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.8.2. Document Exchange</h3>

<p>Because XML grew <a name="INDEX-2674" />
<a name="INDEX-2675" /> <a name="INDEX-2676" />out of the tremendous success of
HTML, many people think of XML as yet another document display tool.
In fact, the real power of XML lies not in the document display
arena, but in the world of data capture and exchange.
</p>

<p>Despite the billions of computers deployed worldwide, sharing data is
as tedious and error-prone as ever. Competing applications do not
operate from common document storage formats, so sending a single
document to a number of recipients is fraught with peril. Even when
vendors attempt to create an interchange format, it still tends to be
proprietary and is often viewed as a competitive advantage for
participating vendors. There is little incentive for vendors to
release application code for the purpose of creating easy
document-exchange tools.
</p>

<p>XML avoids these problems. It is platform-neutral, generic and can
perform almost any data capture task. It is equally available to all
vendors and can be easily integrated into most applications. The
stabilization of the XML standard and the increasing availability of
XML authoring and parsing tools is making it easier and easier to
create XML markup languages for document capture and exchange.
</p>

<p>Most importantly, document exchange rarely requires document
presentation, thus eliminating "display difficulties"
from the equation. Often, an existing application will use XML to
include data from another source, and then use its own internal
display capabilities to present the data to the end user. The cost of
adding XML-based data exchange to existing applications is relatively
small.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-15-SECT-8.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">15.8.3. Connecting Systems</h3>

<p>A level below <a name="INDEX-2677" />
<a name="INDEX-2678" /> <a name="INDEX-2679" />applications, there is also a need for
systems to exchange data. As business-to-business communication
increases, this need grows even faster. In the past, this meant that
someone had to design a protocol to encode and exchange the data.
With XML, exchanging data is as easy as defining a DTD and
integrating the parser into your existing applications.
</p>

<p>The data sets exchanged could in fact be quite small. Imagine
shopping for a new PC on the Web. If you could capture your system
requirements as a small document using an XML DTD, you could send
that spec to a hundred different vendors to quote you a system. If
you extend that model to include almost anything you can shop
for -- from cars to hot tubs -- XML provides an elegant base
layer of communication among cooperating vendors on the Internet.
</p>

<p>Almost any data that is now captured and stored can be more easily
shared using XML. For many systems, the XML DTDs will define a data
transfer protocol and nothing more. The data may never actually be
stored using the XML-defined markup; it may exist in an
XML-compatible form only long enough to pass on the wire between two
systems.
</p>

<p>In conjunction with XML-based data exchange, the Extensible
Stylesheet Language, or XSL, will be increasingly used to describe
the appearance and definition of the data represented by these XML
DTDs. Much like Cascading Style Sheets and their ability to transform
HTML documents, XSL will support the creation of style sheets for any
XML DTD. CSS can be used with XML documents as well, but it is not as
programmatically rich as XSL. While CSS stops with style sheets, XSL
is a style language. XSL certainly addresses the need for data
display, and it also provides rich tools that allow data represented
with one DTD to be transformed into another DTD in a controlled and
deterministic fashion. A complete discussion of XSL is beyond the
scope of this book; consult an appropriate O'Reilly reference
for complete details.
</p>

<p>The potential for XML goes well beyond that of traditional markup and
presentation tools. What we now see and use in the XML world is only
scratching the surface of the potential for this technology.

<h3 class="sect2">15.8.4. Standardizing HTML</h3>

<p>Last but certainly <a name="INDEX-2680" />not least, XML is being used
to define a standard version of HTML known as
<a name="INDEX-2681" />XHTML. XHTML retains almost all of the
features of HTML 4.01, but also introduces a number of minor (and a
few not-so-minor) differences. The next chapter compares and
contrasts XHTML and HTML, mapping out the differences so that you can
begin <a name="INDEX-2682" />creating documents that comply with
both the HTML and XHTML <a name="INDEX-2683" />standards.
