<h2 class="sect1">0.4. Is HTML Going Away?</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-1" />Heavens, no. Why would we even think such
a thing?
</p>

<p>Well, actually, the language has reached middle age in standard
Version 4.01 and is not expected to change again. Rather, HTML is
being subsumed and modularized as part of Extensible Markup Language
(XML). Its new name is XHTML, Extensible Hypertext Markup Language.
</p>

<p>The emergence of XHTML is just another chapter in the often
tumultuous history of HTML and the World Wide Web, where confusion
for authors is the norm, not the exception. At the worst point, the
elders of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) responsible for
accepted and acceptable uses of the language -- i.e.,
standards -- lost control of the language in the browser
"wars" between Netscape Communications and Microsoft. The
abortive HTML+ standard never got off the ground, and HTML 3.0 became
so bogged down in debate that the W3C simply shelved the entire draft
standard. HTML 3.0 never happened, despite what some opportunistic
marketers claimed in their literature. Instead, by late 1996, the
browser manufacturers convinced the W3C to release HTML standard
Version 3.2, which for all intents and purposes simply standardized
most of the leading browser's (Netscape's) HTML
extensions.
</p>

<p>Fortunately for those of us who appreciate and strongly support
standards, the W3C took back its primacy role with HTML 4.0, which
stands today as HTML Version 4.01, released in December 1999. The
standard is clearer and cleaner than any previous ones, establishes
solid implementation models for consistency across browsers and
platforms, provides strong supports and incentives for the companion
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard for HTML-based displays, and
makes provisions for alternative (non-visual) user-agents, as well as
for more universal language supports.
</p>

<p>Cleaner and clearer aside, the W3C realized that HTML could never
keep up with the demands of the web community for more ways to
distribute, process, and display documents. HTML only offers a
limited set of document creation primitives and is hopelessly
incapable of handling non-traditional content like chemical formulae,
musical notation, or mathematical expressions. Nor can it well
support alternative display media, such as handheld computers or
intelligent cellular phones, for instance.
</p>

<p>To address these demands, the W3C developed the Extensible Markup
Language (XML) standard. XML provides the way to create new,
standards-based markup languages that don't take an act of the
W3C to implement. XML-compliant languages deliver information that
can be parsed, processed, displayed, sliced, and diced by the many
different communication technologies that have emerged since the Web
sparked the digital communication revolution a decade ago. XHTML is
HTML reformulated to adhere to the XML standard. It is the foundation
language for the future of the Web.
</p>

<p>Why not just drop HTML for XHTML? For many reasons. First and
foremost, don't expect everyone to just drop everything and
start using XHTML standards (Version 1.0 just got recommended in
January 2000). There's just too much current investment in
HTML-based documentation and expertise for that to happen anytime
soon. Besides, XHTML is HTML 4.01 reformulated as an application of
XML. Know HTML 4 and you're all ready for the future.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-2" /><p>[2]We plumb the depths of XML and XHTML in <a href="ch15_01.htm">Chapter 15, "XML"</a> and <a href="ch16_01.htm">Chapter 16, "XHTML"</a>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The paradox in all this is that even the HTML 4.01 standard is not
the definitive resource. There are many more features of HTML in
popular use and supported by the popular browsers than are included
in the latest language standard. And there are many parts of the
standards that are ignored. We promise you, things can get downright
confusing when you're trying to sort it all out.
</p>

<p>We've managed to sort things out, so you don't have to
sweat over what works with what browser and what doesn't work.
This book, therefore, is the definitive guide to HTML and XHTML. We
give details for all the elements of the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0
standards, plus the variety of interesting and useful extensions to
the language -- some proposed standards -- that the popular
browser manufacturers have chosen to include in their products, such
as:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets</p>
</li><li>
<p>Java and JavaScript</p>
</li><li>
<p>Layers</p>
</li><li>
<p>Multiple columns</p>
</li></ul>
<p>And while we tell you about each and every feature of the language,
standard or not, we also tell you which browsers or different
versions of the same browser implement a particular extension and
which don't. That's critical knowledge when you want to
create web pages that take advantage of the latest version of
Netscape Navigator versus pages that are accessible to the larger
number of people using Internet Explorer or even Lynx, a once-popular
text-only browser for Unix systems.
</p>

<p>In addition, there are a few things that are closely related but not
directly part of HTML. For example, we touch, but do not handle, CGI
and Java programming. CGI and Java programs work closely with HTML
documents and run with or alongside browsers, but are not part of the
language itself, so we don't delve into them. Besides, they are
comprehensive topics that deserve their own books, such as
<em class="emphasis">CGI Programming with Perl, by Scott Guelich, Shishir
Gundavaram, and Gunther Birzneiks,</em> and <em class="emphasis">Java in a
Nutshell</em>, by David Flanagan, both published by
O'Reilly &amp; Associates.
</p>

<p>This is your definitive guide to HTML and XHTML as they are and
should be used, including every extension we could find. Some
extensions aren't documented anywhere, even in the plethora of
online guides. But, if we've missed anything, certainly let us
know and we'll put it in the next edition.<a name="INDEX-2" />
