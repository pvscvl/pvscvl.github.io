<h2 class="sect1">3.5. Document Content</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-320" />
<a name="INDEX-321" />Nearly everything else you put into your
HTML or XHTML document that isn't a tag is by definition
content, and the majority of that is text. Like tags, document
content is encoded using a specific character set, the ISO-8859-1
Latin character set, by default. This character set is a superset of
conventional ASCII, adding the necessary characters to support the
Western European languages. If your keyboard does not allow you to
directly enter the characters you need, you can use character
entities to insert the desired characters.

<h3 class="sect2">3.5.1. Advice Versus Control</h3>

<p>Perhaps the hardest rule to remember when marking up an HTML or XHTML
document is that all the tags you insert regarding text display and
formatting are only advice for the browser: they do not explicitly
control how the browser will display the document. In fact, the
browser can choose to ignore all of your tags and do what it pleases
with the document content. What's worse, the user (of all
people!) has control over the text-display characteristics of his or
her own browser.
</p>

<p>Get used to this lack of control. The best way to use markup to
control the appearance of your documents is to concentrate on the
content of the document, not on its final appearance. If you find
yourself worrying excessively about spacing, alignment, text breaks,
and character positioning, you'll surely end up with ulcers.
You will have gone beyond the intent of HTML. If you focus on
delivering information to users in an attractive manner, using the
tags to advise the browser as to how best to display that
information, you are using HTML or XHTML effectively, and your
documents will render well on a wide range of browsers.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">3.5.2. Character Entities</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-322" />
<a name="INDEX-323" />
<a name="INDEX-324" />
<a name="INDEX-325" /> <a name="INDEX-326" />
<a name="INDEX-327" />
<a name="INDEX-328" />Besides
common text, HTML and XHTML give you a way to display special text
characters that you might not normally be able to include in your
source document or that have other purposes. A good example is the
less-than or opening bracket (&lt;) symbol. In HTML, it normally
signifies the start of a tag, so if you insert it simply as part of
your text, the browser will get confused and probably misinterpret
your document.
</p>

<p>For both HTML and XHTML, the ampersand character instructs the
browser to use a special character, formally known as a
<em class="emphasis">character entity</em>. For example, the command
<tt class="literal">&amp;lt;</tt> inserts that pesky less-than symbol into
the rendered text. Similarly, <tt class="literal">&amp;gt;</tt> inserts the
greater-than symbol, and <tt class="literal">&amp;amp;</tt> inserts an
ampersand. There can be no spaces between the ampersand, the entity
name, and the required, trailing semicolon. (Semicolons aren't
special characters; you don't need to use an ampersand sequence
to display a semicolon normally.)  <a href="ch16_03.htm">Section 16.3.7, "Handling Special Characters"</a>
 

</p>

<p>You also may replace the entity name after the ampersand with a pound
symbol (#) and a decimal value corresponding to the entity's position in the character
set. Hence, the sequence <tt class="literal">&amp;#60;</tt> does the same
thing as <tt class="literal">&amp;lt;</tt> and represents the less-than
symbol. In fact, you could substitute all the normal characters
within an HTML document with ampersand-special characters, such as
<tt class="literal">&amp;#65;</tt> for a capital "A" or
<tt class="literal">&amp;#97;</tt> for its lowercase version, but that
would be silly. A complete listing of all characters, their names,
and numerical equivalents can be found in <a href="appf_01.htm">Appendix F, "Character Entities"</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-329" />Keep in mind that not all
special characters can be rendered by all browsers. Some browsers
just ignore many of the special characters; with others, the
characters aren't available in the character sets on a specific
platform. Be sure to test your documents on a range of browsers
before electing to use some of the more obscure character entities.

<h3 class="sect2">3.5.3. Comments</h3> 
<p><a name="INDEX-330" /> 
<a name="INDEX-331" />Comments are another
type of textual content that appear in the source HTML document, but
are not rendered by the user's browser. Comments fall between
the special <tt class="literal">&lt;!--</tt> and <tt class="literal">--&gt;</tt>
markup elements. Browsers ignore the text between the comment
character sequences.
</p>

<p>Here's a sample comment:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;
&lt;!-- This is a 
multiple line comment
that ends on this line --&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>There must be a space after the initial <tt class="literal">&lt;!--</tt>
and preceding the final <tt class="literal">--&gt;</tt>, but otherwise you
can put nearly anything inside the comment. The biggest exception to
this rule is that the HTML standard doesn't let you nest
comments.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-18">[18]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-18" /><p>[18]Netscape does let you nest comments, but
the practice is tricky; you cannot always predict how other browsers
will react to nested comments.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Internet Explorer also lets you place comments within a special
<tt class="literal">&lt;comment&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-332" /> tag. Everything
between the <tt class="literal">&lt;comment&gt;</tt> and
<tt class="literal">&lt;/comment&gt;</tt> tag is ignored by Internet
Explorer, but all other browsers will display the comment to the
user. Because of this undesirable behavior, we do not recommend using
the <tt class="literal">&lt;comment&gt;</tt> tag for comments. Instead,
always use the <tt class="literal">&lt;!--</tt> and
<tt class="literal">--&gt;</tt> sequences to delimit comments.
</p>

<p>Besides the obvious use of comments for source documentation, many
web servers use comments to take advantage of features specific to
the document server software. These servers scan the document for
specific character sequences within conventional HTML comments and
then perform some action based upon the commands embedded in the
comments. The action might be as simple as including text from
another file (known as a <em class="emphasis">server-side include</em>) or
as complex as executing other commands on the server to generate the
document contents dynamically.<a name="INDEX-333" /> <a name="INDEX-334" />
