<h2 class="sect1">2.7. Hyperlinks</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-180" />
<a name="INDEX-181" />While
text may be the meat and bones of an HTML or XHTML document, the
heart is hypertext. Hypertext gives users the ability to retrieve and
display a different document in their own or someone else's
collection simply by a click of the keyboard or mouse on an
associated word or phrase (<em class="emphasis">hyperlink</em> ) in the
document. Use these interactive hyperlinks to help readers easily
navigate and find information in your own or others'
collections of otherwise separate documents in a variety of formats,
including multimedia, HTML, XHTML, other XML, and plain ASCII text.
Hyperlinks literally bring the wealth of knowledge on the whole
Internet to the tip of the mouse pointer.
</p>

<p>To include a hyperlink to some other document in your own collection
or on a server in Timbuktu, all you need to know is the
document's unique address and how to drop an
<em class="emphasis">anchor</em> into your document.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-7.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.7.1. URLs</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-182" />While it is hard to believe, given the
millions, perhaps billions, of them out there, every document and
resource on the Internet has a unique address known as its
<em class="emphasis">uniform resource locator</em> (URL; commonly
pronounced "you-are-ell"). A URL consists of the
document's name preceded by the hierarchy of directory names in
which the file is stored
(<em class="emphasis">pathname</em><a name="INDEX-183" />
<a name="INDEX-184" />), the Internet
<em class="emphasis">domain name</em> of the server that hosts the file,
and the software and manner by which the browser and the
document's host server communicate to exchange the document
(<em class="emphasis">protocol</em>
<a name="INDEX-185" />):
</p>

<blockquote class="simplelist">

<p><em class="emphasis">protocol://server_domain_name/pathname</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here are some sample URLs:</p>

<blockquote class="simplelist">

<p><em class="emphasis">http://www.kumquat.com/docs/catalog /price_list.html</em></p>

<p><em class="emphasis">price_list.html</em></p>

<p><em class="emphasis">http://www.kumquat.com/</em></p>

<p><em class="emphasis">ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The first example is an
<em class="emphasis">absolute</em><a name="INDEX-186" /> <a name="INDEX-187" /> or complete URL. It includes every part of
the URL format: protocol, server, and the pathname of the document.
</p>
<p>While absolute URLs leave nothing to the imagination, they can lead to big headaches when you move documents to another directory or server. Fortunately, browsers also let you use <em class="emphasis">relative</em> URLs and automatically fill in any missing portions with respective parts from the current document's <em class="emphasis">base</em><a name="INDEX-188" /> URL. The second example is the simplest relative URL of all; with it, the browser assumes that the <em class="emphasis">price_list.html</em> document is located on the same server, in the same directory as the current document, and uses the same network protocol.</p>

<p>Relative URLs are also useful if you don't know a directory or
document's name. The third URL example, for instance, points to
<em class="emphasis">kumquat.com</em>'s web home page. It leaves it
up to the kumquat server to decide what file to send along.
Typically, the server delivers the first file in the directory, one
named <em class="emphasis">index.html</em>, or simply a listing of the
directory's contents.
</p>

<p>Although appearances may deceive, the last FTP example URL actually
is absolute; it points directly at the contents of the
<em class="emphasis">/pub</em> directory.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">2.7.2. Anchors</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-189" />
<a name="INDEX-190" /> <a name="INDEX-191" />The anchor
(<tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt>) tag is the HTML/XHTML feature for
defining both the source and the destination of a
hyperlink.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-11">[11]</a> You'll most often see and use the
<tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt> tag with its <tt class="literal">href</tt>
attribute to define a source hyperlink. The value of the attribute is
the URL of the destination.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-11" /><p>[11]The nomenclature here is a bit
unfortunate: the "anchor" tag should mark just a
destination, not the jumping off point of a hyperlink, too. You
"drop anchor"; you don't jump off one. We
won't even mention the atrociously confusing terminology the
W3C uses for the various parts of a hyperlink except to say that
someone got things all "bass ackwards."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The contents of the source <tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt> tag -- the
words and/or images between it and its <tt class="literal">&lt;/a&gt;</tt>
end tag -- is the portion of the document that is specially
activated in the browser display and that users select to take a
hyperlink. These <em class="emphasis">anchor</em> contents usually look
different from the surrounding content (text in a different color or
underlined, images with specially colored borders, or other effects),
and the mouse pointer icon changes when passed over them. The
<tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt> tag contents, therefore, should be text
or an image (icons are great) that explicitly or intuitively tells
users where the hyperlink will take them. <a href="ch06_03.htm">Section 6.3.1, "The &lt;a&gt; Tag"</a>
</p>

<p>For instance, the browser will specially display and change the mouse
pointer when it passes over the "Kumquat Archive" text in
the following example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">For more information on kumquats, visit our 
&lt;a href="http://www.kumquat.com/archive.html"&gt;
Kumquat Archive&lt;/a&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>If the user clicks the mouse button on that text, the browser
automatically retrieves from the server
<em class="emphasis">www.kumquat.com</em> a web
<em class="emphasis">(http:</em>) page named
<em class="emphasis">archive.html</em>, and then displays it for the user.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-7.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.7.3. Hyperlink Names and Navigation</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-192" /> <a name="INDEX-193" />Pointing to another document in some
collection somewhere on the other side of the world is not only cool,
but it also supports your own web documents. Yet the
hyperlink's chief duty is to help users navigate your
collection in their search for valuable information. Hence, the
concept of the home page and supporting documents has arisen.
</p>

<p>None of your documents should run on and on. First, there's a
serious performance issue: the value of your work suffers, no matter
how rich it is, if the document takes forever to download and, if
once retrieved, users must endlessly scroll up and down through the
display to find a particular section.
</p>

<p>Rather, design your work as a collection of several compact and
succinct pages, like chapters in a book, each focused on a particular
topic for quick selection and browsing by the user. Then use
hyperlinks to organize that collection.
</p>

<p>For instance, use your <a name="INDEX-194" /> <a name="INDEX-195" />home
page -- the leading document of the collection -- as a master
index full of brief descriptions and respective hyperlinks to the
rest of your collection.
</p>

<p>Also use either the <tt class="literal">name</tt> variant of the
<tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt> tag or the <tt class="literal">id</tt>
attribute of nearly all tags to specially identify sections of your
document. Tag <tt class="literal">id</tt>s and <tt class="literal">name</tt>
anchors serve as internal hyperlink targets in your documents to help
users easily navigate within the same document or jump to a
particular section within another document. Refer to that
<tt class="literal">id</tt>'d section in a hyperlink by appending a
pound sign (#) and the section name as the suffix to the URL.
</p>

<p>For instance, to reference a specific topic in an archive, such as
"Kumquat Stew Recipes" in our example Kumquat Archive,
first mark the section title with an <tt class="literal">id</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">... preceding content... 
&lt;h3 id="Stews"&gt;Kumquat Stew Recipes&lt;/h3&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>in the same or another document, then prepare a source hyperlink that
points directly to those recipes by including the section's
<tt class="literal">id</tt> value as a suffix to the document's URL,
separated by a pound sign:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">For more information on kumquats, visit our 
&lt;a href="http://www.kumquat.com/archive.html"&gt;
  Kumquat Archive&lt;/a&gt;, 
and perhaps try one or two of our
&lt;a href="http://www.kumquat.com/archive.html#Stews"&gt; 
  Kumquat Stew Recipes&lt;/a&gt;.</pre></blockquote>

<p>If selected by the user, the latter hyperlink causes the browser to
download the <em class="emphasis">archive.html</em> document and start the
display at our "Stews" section. <a name="INDEX-196" /> <a name="INDEX-197" />
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-2-SECT-7.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.7.4. Anchors Beyond </h3>

<p>Hyperlinks are not limited to other HTML and XHTML documents. Anchors
let you point to nearly any type of document available over the
Internet, including other Internet services.
</p>

<p>However, "let" and "enable" are two different
things. Browsers can manage the various Internet services, like FTP
and Gopher, so that users can download non-HTML documents. They
don't yet fully or gracefully handle
<a name="INDEX-198" />multimedia.
</p>

<p>Today, there are few standards for the many types and formats of
multimedia. Computer systems connected to the Web vary wildly in
their abilities to display those sound and video formats. Except for
some graphics images, standard HTML gives you no specific provision
for display of multimedia documents except the ability to reference
one in an anchor. The browser, which retrieves the multimedia
document, must activate a special
<em class="emphasis">helper</em><a name="INDEX-199" /> <a name="INDEX-200" />
<a name="INDEX-201" /> application,
download and execute an associated <em class="emphasis">applet</em>, or
have a <em class="emphasis">plug-in</em> accessory installed to decode and
display it for the user right within the document's display.
</p>

<p>Although HTML and most web browsers currently avoid the confusion by
sidestepping it, that doesn't mean you can't or
shouldn't exploit multimedia in your documents: just be aware
of the limitations.<a name="INDEX-202" /> <a name="INDEX-203" />
