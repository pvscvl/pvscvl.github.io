<h2 class="sect1">1.2. Talking the Internet Talk</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-17" />Every
computer connected to the Internet (even a beat-up old Apple II) has
a unique address: a number whose format is defined by the
<em class="emphasis">Internet Protocol</em> (IP), the standard that
defines how messages are passed from one machine to another on the
Net. An <em class="emphasis">IP
address</em><a name="INDEX-18" /> is made up of four numbers, each
less than 256, joined together by periods, such as 192.12.248.73 or
131.58.97.254.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-19" />
<a name="INDEX-20" />While
computers deal only with numbers, people prefer names. For this
reason, each computer on the Internet also has a name bestowed upon
it by its owner. There are several million machines on the Net, so it
would be very difficult to come up with that many unique names, let
alone keep track of them all. Recall, though, that the Internet is a
network of networks. It is divided into groups known as
<em class="emphasis">domains</em>, which are further divided into one or
more <em class="emphasis">subdomains.</em> So, while you might choose a
very common name for your computer, it becomes unique when you
append, like surnames, all of the machine's domain names as a
period-separated suffix, creating a <em class="emphasis">fully qualified</em>
domain name.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-21" />
<a name="INDEX-22" />This naming stuff is
easier than it sounds. For example, the fully qualified domain name
<em class="emphasis">www.oreilly.com</em> translates to a machine named
"www" that's part of the domain known as
"oreilly," which, in turn, is part of the commercial
(com) branch of the Internet. Other branches of the Internet include
educational institutions (edu), nonprofit organizations (org), U.S.
government (gov), and Internet service providers (net). Computers and
networks outside the United States may have a two-letter abbreviation
at the end of their names: for example, "ca" for Canada,
"jp" for Japan, and "uk" for the United
Kingdom.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-23" />Special
computers, known as <em class="emphasis">name servers</em>, keep tables of
machine names and their associated unique IP numerical addresses and
translate one into the other for us and for our machines. Domain
names must be registered and sometimes paid for through the nonprofit
organization InterNIC. Once registered, the owner of the domain name
broadcasts it and its address to other domain name servers around the
world. Each domain and subdomain has an associated name server, so
ultimately every machine is known uniquely by both a name and an IP
address.

<h3 class="sect2">1.2.1. Clients, Servers, and Browsers</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-24" />
<a name="INDEX-25" />
<a name="INDEX-26" />The Internet connects two kinds of
computers: <em class="emphasis">servers</em>, which serve up documents,
and <em class="emphasis">clients</em>, which retrieve and display
documents for us humans. Things that happen on the server machine are
said to be on the <em class="emphasis">server side</em>, while activities
on the client machine occur on the <em class="emphasis">client side</em>.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-27" />
<a name="INDEX-28" />To access and display HTML documents,
we run programs called <em class="emphasis">browsers</em> on our client
computers. These browser clients talk to special <em class="emphasis">web
servers</em> over the Internet to access and retrieve
electronic documents.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-29" />
<a name="INDEX-30" />Several web browsers are
available -- most are free -- each offering a different set of
features. For example, browsers like Lynx run on character-based
clients and display documents only as text. Then there are others
that run on clients with graphical displays and render documents
using proportional fonts and color graphics on a 1024 x 768,
24-bit-per-pixel display. Others still -- Netscape Navigator,
Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Opera, and Mozilla, to name a
few -- have special features that allow you to retrieve and
display a variety of electronic documents over the Internet,
including audio and video multimedia.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.2. The Flow of Information</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-31" />
<a name="INDEX-32" />
<a name="INDEX-33" />All web activity begins on the client side,
when a user starts his or her browser. The browser begins by loading
a <em class="emphasis">home page</em> document from either local storage
or from a server over some network, such as the Internet, a corporate
intranet, or a town extranet. In these latter cases, the client
browser first consults a domain name system (DNS) server to translate
the home page document server's name, such as
<em class="emphasis">www.oreilly.com</em>, into an IP address, before
sending a request to that server over the Internet. This request (and
the server's reply) is formatted according to the dictates of
the <a name="INDEX-34" /><em class="emphasis">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em>
(HTTP) standard.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-35" />
<a name="INDEX-36" />A server spends most of
its time listening to the network, waiting for document requests with
the server's unique address stamped on it. Upon receipt, the
server verifies that the requesting browser is allowed to retrieve
documents from the server, and, if so, checks for the requested
document. If found, the server sends (downloads) the document to the
browser. The server usually logs the request, the client
computer's name, document requested, and the time.
</p>

<p>Back on the browser, the document arrives. If it's a
plain-vanilla ASCII text file, most browsers display it in a common,
plain-vanilla way. Document directories, too, are treated like plain
documents, although most graphical browsers will display folder
icons, which the user can select with the mouse to download the
contents of subdirectories.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-37" />Browsers also
retrieve binary files from a server. Unless assisted by a
<em class="emphasis">helper</em> program or specially enabled by
<em class="emphasis">plug-in</em><a name="INDEX-38" />
<a name="INDEX-39" />
<a name="INDEX-40" />
software or <em class="emphasis">applets</em>, which display an image or
video file or play an audio file, the browser usually stores
downloaded binary files directly on a local disk for later use.
</p>

<p>For the most part, however, the browser retrieves a special document
that appears to be a plain text file, but contains both text and
special markup codes called <em class="emphasis">tags.</em> The browser
processes these HTML or XHTML documents, formatting the text based
upon the tags and downloading special accessory files, such as
images.
</p>

<p>The user reads the document, selects a hyperlink to another document,
and the entire process starts over.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">1.2.3. Beneath the World Wide Web</h3>

<p>We should point out again that browsers and HTTP servers need not be
part of the Internet's World Wide Web to function. In fact, you
never need to be connected to the Internet, an intranet or extranet,
or to any network, for that matter, to write documents and operate a
browser. You can load up and display on your client browser locally
stored documents and accessory files directly. This isolation is
good: it gives you the opportunity to finish, in the editorial sense
of the word, a document collection for later distribution. Diligent
authors work locally to write and proof their documents before
releasing them for general distribution, thereby sparing readers the
agonies of broken image files and bogus hyperlinks.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-3" /><p>[3]Vigorous testing of the HTML documents once they are made
available on the Web is, of course, also highly recommended and
necessary to rid them of various linking bugs.</p> </blockquote>

<p><a name="INDEX-41" />
<a name="INDEX-42" />
<a name="INDEX-43" />Organizations,
too, can be connected to the Internet and the World Wide Web, but
also maintain private webs and document collections for distribution
to clients on their local network, or intranet. In fact, private webs
are fast becoming the technology of choice for the paperless offices
we've heard so much about these last few years. With HTML, and
especially with next-generation XHTML document collections,
businesses and other enterprises can maintain personnel databases,
complete with employee photographs and online handbooks, collections
of blueprints, parts, and assembly manuals, and so on -- all
readily and easily accessed electronically by authorized users and
displayed on a local computer.<a name="INDEX-44" />

<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-2.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.2.4. Standards Organizations</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-45" />Like many
popular technologies, HTML started out as an informal specification
used by only a few people. As more and more authors began to use the
language, it became obvious that more formal means were needed to
define and manage -- to standardize -- the language's
features, making it easier for everyone to create and share
documents.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-2.4.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.4.1. The World Wide Web Consortium</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-46" /> <a name="INDEX-47" />The World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) was formed with the charter to define the standards for HTML.
Members are responsible for drafting, circulating for review, and
modifying the standard based on cross-Internet feedback to best meet
the needs of the many.
</p>

<p>Beyond HTML, the W3C has the broader responsibility of standardizing
any technology related to the World Wide Web; they manage the HTTP,
Cascading Style Sheet, and Extensible Markup Language (XML)
standards, as well as related standards for document addressing on
the Web. And they solicit draft standards for extensions to existing
web technologies.
</p>

<p>If you want to track HTML, XML, XHTML, CSS, and other exciting web
development and related technologies, contact the W3C at
<a href="../../../../../../www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org</a> .
</p>

<p>Also, several Internet newsgroups are devoted to the Web, each a part
of the <em class="emphasis">comp.infosystems.www</em> hierarchy. These
include <em class="emphasis">comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html</em> and
<em class="emphasis">comp.infosystems.www.authoring.images</em>.

<a name="html4-CHP-1-SECT-2.4.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.2.4.2. The Internet Engineering Task Force</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-48" /> <a name="INDEX-49" />Even broader in reach than
W3C, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is responsible for
defining and managing every aspect of Internet technology. The World
Wide Web is just one small part under the purview of the IETF.
</p>

<p>The IETF defines all of the technology of the Internet via official
documents known as Requests For Comment, or RFCs. Individually
numbered for easy reference, each RFC addresses a specific Internet
technology -- everything from the syntax of domain names and the
allocation of IP addresses to the format of electronic mail messages.
</p>

<p>To learn more about the IETF and follow the progress of various RFCs
as they are circulated for review and revision, visit the IETF home
