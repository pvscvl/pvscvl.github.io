<p>We didn't spend hours studiously poring over some reference
book before we wrote our first HTML document. You probably
shouldn't, either. HTML is simple to read and understand, and
it's simple to write, too. And once you've written an
HTML document, you've nearly completed your first XHTML one,
too. So let's get started without first learning a lot of
arcane rules.
</p>

<p>To help you get that quick, satisfying start, we've included
this chapter as a brief summary of the many elements of HTML and its
progeny, XHTML. Of course, we've left out a lot of details and
some tricks that you should know. Read the upcoming chapters to get
the essentials for becoming fluent in HTML and XHTML.
</p>

<p>Even if you are familiar with the languages, we recommend you work
your way through this chapter before tackling the rest of the book.
It not only gives you a working grasp of basic HTML and its jargon,
but you'll also be more productive later, flush with the
confidence that comes from creating attractive documents in such a
short time.

<p><a name="INDEX-96" />
<a name="INDEX-97" />
<a name="INDEX-98" />
<a name="INDEX-99" />
<a name="INDEX-100" />Use any text editor to create an HTML or
XHTML document, as long as it can save your work on disk in
<a name="INDEX-101" />ASCII text file format.
That's because even though documents include elaborate text
layout and pictures, they're all just plain old ASCII documents
themselves. A fancier WYSIWYG editor or a translator for your
favorite word processor are fine, too -- although they may not
support the many nonstandard features we discuss later in this book.
You'll probably end up touching up the source text they
produce, as well.
</p>

<p>While not needed to compose documents, you should have at least one
version of a popular <a name="INDEX-102" />browser installed on your computer to
view your work, preferably Netscape Navigator or Microsoft's
Internet Explorer. That's because the source document you
compose on your text editor doesn't look anything like what
gets displayed by a browser, even though it's the same
document. Make sure what your readers actually see is what you
intended by viewing the document yourself with a browser. Besides,
the popular ones are free over the Internet.
</p>

<p>Also note that you don't need a connection to the Internet or
the World Wide Web to write and view your HTML or XHTML documents.
You may compose and view your documents stored on a hard drive or
floppy disk that's attached to your computer. You can even
navigate among your local documents with the languages'
hyperlinking capabilities without ever being connected to the
Internet, or any other network, for that matter. In fact, we
recommend that you work locally to develop and thoroughly test your
documents before you share them with others.
</p>

<p>We strongly recommend, however, that you <em class="emphasis">do</em> get
a connection to the Internet if you are serious about composing your
own documents. You may download and view others' interesting
web pages and see how they accomplished some interesting
feature -- good or bad. Learning by example is fun, too. (Reusing
others' work, on the other hand, is often questionable, if not
downright illegal.) An Internet connection is essential if you
include in your work hyperlinks to other documents on the Internet.
