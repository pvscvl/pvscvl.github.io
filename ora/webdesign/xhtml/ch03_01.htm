<p><a name="INDEX-276" />Most HTML and XHTML documents are very
simple, and writing one shouldn't intimidate even the most
timid of computer users. First, although you might use a fancy
WYSIWYG editor to help you compose it, a document is ultimately
stored, distributed, and read by a browser as a simple ASCII text
file.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-16">[16]</a>
That's why even the poorest user with a barebones text editor
can compose the most elaborate of web pages. (Accomplished webmasters
often elicit the admiration of "newbies" by composing
astonishingly cool pages using the crudest text editor on a cheap
laptop computer and performing in odd places like on a bus or in the
bathroom.) Authors should, however, keep several of the popular
browsers on hand and alternate among them to view new documents under
construction. Remember, browsers differ in how they display a page,
not all browsers implement all of the language standards, and some
have their own special extensions.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-16" /><p>[16]Informally, both the text and the markup tags
are ASCII characters. Technically, unless you specify otherwise, text
and tags are made up of eight-bit characters as defined in the
standard ISO-8859-1 Latin character set. The standards do support
alternative character encoding, including Arabic and Cyrillic. See
<a href="appf_01.htm">Appendix F, "Character Entities"</a> for details.</p> </blockquote>

<h2 class="sect1">3.1. Appearances Can Deceive</h2>

<p>Documents never look alike when displayed by a text editor and when
displayed by a browser. Take a look at any source document from the
World Wide Web. At the very least, return characters, tabs, and
leading spaces, although important for readability of the source text
document, are ignored for the most part. There also is a lot of extra
text in a source document, mostly from the display tags and
interactivity markers and their parameters that affect portions of
the document, but don't themselves appear in the display.
</p>

<p>Accordingly, new authors are confronted with having to develop not
only a presentation style for their web pages, but a different style
for their source text. The source document's layout should
highlight the programming-like markup aspects of HTML and XHTML, not
their display aspects. And it should be readable not only by you, the
author, but by others as well.
</p>

<p>Experienced document writers typically adopt a programming-like
style, albeit very relaxed, for their source text. We do the same
throughout this book, and that style will become apparent as you
compare our source examples with the actual display of the document
by a browser.
</p>

<p>Our formatting style is simple, but it serves to create readable,
easily maintained documents:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Except for the document structural tags like
<tt class="literal">&lt;html&gt;</tt>, <tt class="literal">&lt;head&gt;</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</tt>, any element we use to structure the
content of a document is placed on a separate line and indented to
show its nesting level within the document. Such elements include
lists, forms, tables, and similar tags.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Any element used to control the appearance or style of text is
inserted in the current line of text. This includes basic font style
tags like <tt class="literal">&lt;b&gt;</tt> (bold text) and document
linkages like <tt class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</tt> (hypertext anchor).
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Avoid, where possible, the breaking of a URL onto two lines. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Add extra newline characters to set apart special sections of the
source document, for instance, around paragraphs or tables.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><a name="INDEX-277" />
<a name="INDEX-278" />
<a name="INDEX-279" />
<a name="INDEX-280" />
<a name="INDEX-281" />The task of
maintaining the indentation of your source file ranges from trivial
to onerous. Some text editors, like Emacs, manage the indentation
automatically; others, like common word processors, couldn't
care less about indentation and leave the task completely up to you.
If your editor makes your life difficult, you might consider striking
a compromise, perhaps by indenting the tags to show structure, but
leaving the actual text without indentation to make modifications
easier.
</p>

<p>No matter what compromises or stands you make on source code style,
it's important that you adopt one. You'll be very glad
you did when you go back to that document you wrote three months ago
searching for that really cool trick you did with. . . . Now, where
was that?
