<h2 class="sect1">8.6. Applying Styles to Documents</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-1723" /> <a name="INDEX-1724" />
<a name="INDEX-1725" />There are several issues you should
consider before, during, and after you use styles in your web
documents and document collections. The first, overarching issue is
whether to use them at all. Frankly, few of the style effects are
unique; most can be achieved, albeit less easily and with much less
consistency, via the physical and content-based style tags like
<tt class="literal">&lt;i&gt;</tt> and <tt class="literal">&lt;em&gt;</tt> and
the various tag attributes like <tt class="literal">color</tt> and
<tt class="literal">background</tt>.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-8-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.6.1. To Style or Not to Style</h3>

<p>We think the CSS2 standard is a winner, not only over just
JavaScript-based standards, but mostly for the convenience and
effectiveness of all your mark-up documents, including HTML, XHTML,
and any and most other XML-compliant ones. The majority of browsers
in use today support CSS2 styles. The benefits are clear. So, why
wouldn't you use styles?
</p>

<p>Although we strongly urge that you learn and use CSS2 style sheets
for your documents, we realize that creating style sheets is an
investment of time and energy that pays off over the long run.
Designing a style sheet for a one- or two-page document is probably
not time-effective, particularly if you won't be reusing the
style sheet for any other documents. In general, however, we believe
the choice is not <em class="emphasis">if</em> you should use CSS2 style
sheets, but when.
</p>

</div>
<a name="html4-CHP-8-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.6.2.  Which Type of Style Sheet and When</h3>

<p>Once you have decided to use Cascading Style Sheets (for pain or
pleasure), the next question is which type of style
sheet -- inline, document-level, or external -- should you
apply and when? Each has its pros and cons; each is best applied
under certain circumstances.
</p>

<a name="html4-CHP-8-SECT-6.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.6.2.1. The pros and cons of external styles</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1726" />
<a name="INDEX-1727" /> <a name="INDEX-1728" /> <a name="INDEX-1729" /> <a name="INDEX-1730" />Since style sheets provide consistency in
the presentation of your documents, external style sheets are the
best and the easiest way to manage styles for your entire document
collection. Simply place the desired style rules in a style sheet and
apply those styles to the desired documents. And since all the
documents are affected by a single style sheet, conversion of the
entire collection to a new style is as simple as changing a single
rule in the corresponding external style sheet.
</p>

<p>Even in cases where documents may differ in style, it is often
possible to collect a few basic style rules in a single sheet that
can be shared among several otherwise different documents, including:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Background color</p>
</li><li>
<p>Background image</p>
</li><li>
<p>Font sizes and faces</p>
</li><li>
<p>Margins</p>
</li><li>
<p>Text alignment</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Another benefit of external style sheets is that other web authors
who want to copy your style can easily access that sheet and make
their pages look like yours. Imitation being the sincerest form of
flattery, you should not be troubled when someone elects to emulate
the look and feel of your pages. More to the point, you can't
stop them from linking to your style sheets, so you might as well
learn to like it. Like conventional HTML documents, it is not
possible to encrypt or otherwise hide your style sheets so that
others cannot view and use them.
</p>

<p>The biggest problem with external style sheets is that they increase
the amount of time needed to access a given web page. Not only must
the browser download the page itself, it must also download the style
sheet before the page can be displayed to the user. While most style
sheets are relatively small, their existence can definitely be felt
when accessing the Web over a slow connection.
</p>

<p>Without appropriate discipline, external style sheets can become
large and unwieldy. When creating style sheets, remember to include
only those styles that are common to the pages using the sheet. If a
set of styles is needed only for one or two sheets, you are better
off isolating them in a separate sheet or adding them to a document
using document-level styles. Otherwise, you may find yourself
expending an exorbitant amount of effort counteracting the effects of
external styles in many individual documents.
</p>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-8-SECT-6.2.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.6.2.2. The pros and cons of document-level styles</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1731" /> <a name="INDEX-1732" /> <a name="INDEX-1733" />
<a name="INDEX-1734" />Document-level
styles are most useful when creating a custom document. They let you
override one or more rules in your externally defined style to create
a slightly different document.
</p>

<p>You might also want to use document-level styles to experiment with
new style rules before moving them to your style sheets. By adding
and changing rules using document-level styles, you eliminate the
risk of adding a broken style to your style sheets, breaking the
appearance of all the documents that use that sheet.
</p>

<p>The biggest problem with document styles is that you may succumb to
using them in lieu of creating a formal, external style sheet to
manage your document collection. It is easy to simply add rules to
each document, cutting and pasting as you create new documents.
Unfortunately, managing a collection of documents with document-level
styles is tedious and error-prone. Even a simple change can result in
hours of editing and potential mistakes.
</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, any style rule that impacts three or more
documents should be moved to a style sheet and applied to those
documents using the <tt class="literal">&lt;link&gt;</tt> tag or
<tt class="literal">@import</tt> at-rule. Adhering to this rule as you
create your document families will pay off in the long run when it is
time to change your styles.
</p>

</div>

<a name="html4-CHP-8-SECT-6.2.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.6.2.3. The pros and cons of inline styles</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1735" /> <a name="INDEX-1736" />And at the end of the
cascade, inline styles override the more general styles. Get into the
habit now of using inline styles rarely and just for that purpose,
too. Inline styles cannot be reused, making style management
difficult. Moreover, such changes are spread throughout your
documents, making finding and altering inline styles error-prone.
(That's why we might eschew tag- and attribute-based styles in
the first place, no?)
</p>

<p>Any time you use an inline style, think long and hard as to whether
the same effect might be accomplished using a style class definition.
For instance, you are better off defining:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;!--
  p.centered {text-align: center}
  em.blue {color: blue}
--&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>and later using:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;p class=centered&gt;
&lt;em class=blue&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>instead of:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;em style="color: blue"&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Your styles are easier to find <a name="INDEX-1737" />and manage and can be <a name="INDEX-1738" />easily reused
throughout your <a name="INDEX-1739" />documents.<a name="INDEX-1740" /> <a name="INDEX-1741" /> <a name="INDEX-1742" />
