<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>

<p>In the beginning, the Web was simple. When I first encountered it in
early 1993 (working for O'Reilly's Global Network
Navigator), there was only one browser for viewing web pages, and it
ran exclusively on the Unix platform. There were only about a dozen
tags that did anything interesting. Designing a web page was a
relatively simple task.
</p>

<p>It didn't stay simple for long. With the explosion of the Web
came an avalanche of new technologies, proprietary tags, and
acronyms. Even for someone who is immersed in the terminology and
environment on a professional basis, it can be truly overwhelming.
You just can't keep all this stuff in your head anymore.
</p>

<p>Since leaving O'Reilly's Cambridge, MA offices for a
freelance career, I never feel more alone than when I get
stuck -- whether it's because I don't know what audio
format to use for a project, or I just can't remember what tag
uses that <tt class="literal">MARGINWIDTH</tt> attribute. And I'm not
ashamed to admit that I've been reduced to tears after battling
a table that mysteriously refused to behave, despite my meticulous
and earnest efforts.
</p>

<p>It's at times like these that I wish I could walk down the hall
and get advice from an expert co-worker. Without that luxury at my
home office, I do the best I can with the volumes of web design
information available online (on the Internet, no one knows you have
red, puffy eyes). Unfortunately, finding the answer to a specific
question is a time-consuming and sometimes equally frustrating
process in itself. Deadlines often can't accommodate a two-hour
scavenger hunt.
</p>

<p>I wrote <em class="citetitle">Web Design in a Nutshell</em> because it
was the book I needed -- one place to go to find quick answers to
my questions. Apparently, lots of other folks needed it too, as it
went on to be a best-seller and found a permanent home on the desks
of web designers around the globe.
</p>

<p>The difficult thing about writing about the Web is that it's a
moving target, constantly changing and evolving. A lot has happened
with the Web since I wrote the first edition in 1998. We've
seen new technologies emerge and others fade away. The raging browser
wars have quieted and the industry is inching towards standards
compliance. Countless software versions have come and gone.
</p>

<p>This new edition has been thoroughly reviewed and revamped to reflect
the new web design environment. All HTML chapters have been updated
to reflect the 4.01 specification, and the browser support
information now reflects Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 (in beta as of
this writing) and Netscape 6. In keeping with current trends, there
is a new emphasis on creating web pages according to
standards -- using HTML for structure and Cascading Style Sheets
for all style information. Although traditional nonstandard web
tricks are still included for the sake of thoroughness, they are
presented in a more cautionary tone.
</p>

<p>In addition to the buff and shine on existing chapters, I've
added a number of new chapters on important topics, including:
printing pages from the Web (<a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Printing from the Web"</a>), making
web pages accessible to users with disabilities (<a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Accessibility"</a>), Flash and Shockwave (<a href="ch26_01.htm">Chapter 26, "Flash and Shockwave"</a>), multimedia presentations with SMIL (<a href="ch27_01.htm">Chapter 27, "Introduction to SMIL"</a>), XHTML (<a href="ch31_01.htm">Chapter 31, "XHTML"</a>), and
designing for the wireless web with WML (<a href="ch32_01.htm">Chapter 32, "WAP and WML"</a>). I'm pleased to say that this edition
is a significant improvement over the last.
</p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="wdnut2-PREF-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Contents</h2>

<p>This book focuses on the front-end aspects of web design: HTML
authoring, graphics production, and media development. It is not a
resource for programming, scripting, or server functions; however,
whenever possible, I have tried to provide enough background
information on these topics to give designers a level of familiarity
with the terminology and technologies. The content in this book is
appropriate for all levels of expertise -- from professionals who
need to look up a particular detail, to beginners who may require
full explanations of new concepts and individual tags.
</p>

<p>The book is divided into six parts, each covering a general subject
area.
