<h2 class="sect1">25.3. Video File Formats</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-2688" /> <a name="INDEX-2689" />As with audio, in the early days of
the Web, adding video to a web page meant using one of the currently
available video formats (such as QuickTime or AVI) and linking it to
a page for download. The evolution of streaming media has changed
that, and now adding video content like movie trailers, news
broadcasts, even live programming to a web site is much more
practical and widespread.
</p>

<p>This section looks at the video formats that are most common for web
delivery.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-25-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">25.3.1. QuickTime Movie (.mov)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2690" />
<a name="INDEX-2691" /> <a name="INDEX-2692" />QuickTime is a highly versatile and
well-supported media format. While originally developed as a video
format, it has evolved into a container format capable of storing all
sorts of media (still images, audio, video, Flash, and SMIL
presentations). For the complete list of file formats supported by
QuickTime, see <a href="../../../../../../www.apple.com/quicktime/specifications.html">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/specifications.html</a>.
</p>

<p>QuickTime, a system extension that makes it possible to view
audio/video information on a computer, was introduced by Apple
Computer in 1991. Although developed for the Macintosh, it is also
supported on PCs via QuickTime for Windows. QuickTime has grown to be
the industry standard for multimedia development, and most hardware
and software offer QuickTime support. Both Netscape Navigator 3.0+
and Internet Explorer 3.0+ come with QuickTime plug-in players, so
the majority of web readers are able to view QuickTime movies right
in the browser.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-25-SECT-3.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.3.1.1. Streaming</h3>

<p>QuickTime movies can be streamed using a number of streaming server
packages, including Apple's QuickTime Server for Mac OS X or
its open source Darwin Streaming Server for Unix. To give the
illusion of streaming from an HTTP server (pseudo-streaming), create
FastStart Quicktime movies, which begin playing right away and
continue playing as the file downloads.
</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-25-SECT-3.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.3.1.2. Creating QuickTime movies</h3>

<p>You can take care of rudimentary video editing, such as deleting and
rearranging, right in Apple's free QuickTime Player. The
QuickTime Pro version ($29.95) offers more features and is sufficient
for most basic tasks. For advanced video editing, use a professional
video editing tool such as Adobe Premier or AfterEffects (most video
editors support QuickTime). You may also use a file converter, such
as Cleaner from Terran Interactive (<a href="../../../../../../www.terran.com/">http://www.terran.com</a>) to convert existing
files to QuickTime format.
</p>

<p>Other video editing applications for the Mac include iMovie (which
ships free on newer Macintoshes) and Final Cut Pro, a more
professional video editing program.
</p>

<p>An important step to remember when saving a movie is to make it
<em class="firstterm">self-contained</em>. This process resolves all data
references and prepares the file to go out on the Internet on its
own. You will also be asked to pick a codec (QuickTime supports
several). Cinepak is a good general purpose codec; Sorenson is more
efficient but not as well supported.
</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-25-SECT-3.1.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">25.3.1.3. Reference movies</h3>

<p>Another interesting feature of Version 2.0 and higher of the
QuickTime plug-in is its support for <a name="INDEX-2693" />reference movies. Reference
movies are used as pointers to alternate versions (or
"tracks") of a movie, each optimized for a different
connection speed. When a user downloads the reference movie, the
plug-in ensures that the best track for the current connection speed
is played.
</p>

<p>You could also save a version of your movie that doesn't use
the Sorenson codec in the reference file. This movie will play for
users who don't have the latest plug-in version, ensuring
backwards compatibility.
</p>

<h3 class="sect3">25.3.1.4. For more information</h3>

<p>The process for adding QuickTime to a web page is discussed later in
this chapter.For general information on QuickTime, see Apple's
site at <a href="../../../../../../www.apple.com/quicktime/">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/</a>.For complete information on all aspects of QuickTime
creation and delivery, I recommend the book <em class="emphasis">QuickTime for
the Web: A Hands-On Guide for Webmasters, Site Designers, and HTML
Authors</em> by the folks at Apple Computer, Inc. (Morgan
Kaufmann, 2000). It is an excellent reference if you are serious
about QuickTime for adding multimedia elements to your site.

<h3 class="sect2">25.3.2. RealMedia (.rm)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2697" />RealMedia is the industry
standard streaming media format. RealNetworks (which used to be
Progressive Networks) first launched its streaming video capabilities
in Version 3.0 of its RealMedia line of products (of which RealAudio
is the star component). RealMedia files (<em class="filename">.rm</em>)
are viewed using RealPlayer 3 and higher. The wide distribution of
RealPlayer and a proven track record of effective playback have made
RealNetworks' products the de facto standard for adding
streaming media to a web site.
</p>

<p>The components of the RealMedia system (RealPlayer for playback,
RealServer for serving simultaneous streams, and RealProducer for
creating <em class="filename">.rm</em> files) are the same as for
RealAudio. The descriptions of each component as discussed in <a href="ch24_01.htm">Chapter 24, "Audio on the Web"</a> apply to video as well. RealMedia movies are
encoded using a proprietary codec built into RealProducer and
RealPlayer.
</p>

consumer-oriented information and downloads, see <a href="../../../../../../www.real.com/">http://www.real.com</a>.

<h3 class="sect2">25.3.3. Windows Media (.wmv or .asf)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2698" />
<a name="INDEX-2699" /> <a name="INDEX-2700" />Windows Media is the new standard for
audio and video, created by Microsoft and therefore very closely
integrated with the Windows OS. The Windows Media Player is capable
of playing Microsoft's proprietary Windows Media Video
(<em class="filename">.wmv</em>) and Advanced Streaming Format
(<em class="filename">.asf</em> ), as well as a number of other formats
such as AVI, MPEG, MP3, and QuickTime.
</p>

<p>The Windows Media system is also comprised of Windows Media Server
(which runs only on Windows NT/2000) and tools for creating
<em class="filename">.wmv</em> and <em class="filename">.asf</em> files
(Windows Media Author and Windows Media Encoder, which are both
Windows only). These components, as well as the methods for adding
Windows Media to a web page, are discussed in <a href="ch24_01.htm">Chapter 24, "Audio on the Web"</a>.
</p>

<p>Windows Media movies are encoded using the proprietary Windows Media
Video codec (currently in Version 8) designed especially for the
Windows Media system. Users must have the Windows Media Player 8 in
order to play movies encoded with the Version 8 codec. Use Version 7
if you don't want to force your users to upgrade (or if the
processing power of your PC cannot handle the demands of the Version
8 encoder).
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">25.3.4. AVI (.avi)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2701" />AVI
(which stands for Audio/Video Interleaved) was introduced by
Microsoft in 1992 as the standard movie format to work with its Video
for Windows (VFW) multimedia architecture for Windows 95. The AVI
format has been replaced by the more robust Windows Media as the
standard media format for Windows. Macintosh users can view AVI files
using the QuickTime player. In AVI files, the audio and video
information is interleaved every frame, which in theory produces
smoother playback.
</p>

<p>With the growing (and well-deserved) popularity of streaming media
systems, AVI movies are not as common as they once were for web
distribution. More often, they serve as the high-quality source file
for the video which is then converted into a more web-friendly
format.
</p>

<p>The following summarizes the AVI format:</p>

<h3 class="sect2">25.3.5. MPEG (.mpg or .mpeg)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2702" />MPEG is a
set of multimedia standards created by the Moving Picture Experts
Group. It supports three types of information: video, audio, and
streaming (which, in the context of MPEG compression, is synchronized
video and audio). MPEG was initially popular as a web format because
it was the only format that could be produced on the Unix system.
</p>

<p>MPEG files offer extremely high compression rates with little loss of
quality. They accomplish this using a lossy compression technique
that strips out data that is not discernible to the human ear or eye.
</p>

<p>There are a number of MPEG standards: MPEG-1 was originally developed
for video transfer at VHS quality; MPEG-2 is a higher-quality
standard that was developed for television broadcast; other MPEG
specs that address other needs (such as MPEG-4 and -7) are currently
in development. MPEGs can be compressed using one of three schemes,
Layer-I, -II, or -III. The complexity of the coding (and therefore
the processor power needed to encode and decode) increases at each
level. Due to this complexity, you need special encoding tools to
produce MPEG videos.
</p>

<p>MPEG-1 (which uses the <em class="filename">.mpg</em> or
<em class="filename">.mpeg</em> suffix) is the most appropriate format for
web purposes. MPEG-2 files are rare except in broadcast studios and
on DVDs and are not well suited for web delivery.
</p>
