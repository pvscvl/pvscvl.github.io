<h2 class="sect1">32.2. Creating WAP Applications</h2>

<p>Before<a name="INDEX-3020" /> diving into the specifics of the WML
specification, let's look at some of the general issues and
processes of creating WAP content:
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-32-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">32.2.1. A New Model</h3>

<p>If you are accustomed to designing pages for the Web, you will need
to adjust (and reduce) your thinking for handheld devices. Due to the
limitations in screen size, processing power, and connection speed,
normal information-rich web pages are not feasible. In fact, it is
useful to abandon the notion of "documents" (information
that is displayed and read) and think in terms of
"applications" (based on choices and user interaction).
WAP applications are typically made up of screenfuls of minimal text
and lists of options. Information and interaction design is king as
there is virtually no graphic design to be done.
</p>

<p>Another difference is that unlike the Web, where it is desirable to
entice a visitor to linger at your site as long as possible, a
successful WAP application can be measured by how quickly the user
can find information or make a transaction and get out.
</p>

</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-32-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">32.2.2. WAP Browsers</h3>

<p>Mobile<a name="INDEX-3021" />
<a name="INDEX-3022" />
devices use special browsing software, sometimes referred to as
"microbrowsers" due to their size and capacity, to
request and display information from a network. As on the Web, not
all WAP browsers are created equal. Older devices with outdated
browsers are still in circulation, and what works on one device may
not work on another at all.
</p>

<p>Add to that the fact that the WML specification allows for a range of
interpretations of elements and functions, so even browsers that are
100% WML-compliant may have significant differences in their
implementation of the standard.
</p>

<p>Most WAP-enabled devices use the recently renamed Openwave Mobile
Browser (formerly called UP.Browser) developed by Openwave (at one
time called Unwired Planet, thus "UP"). For a list of
devices that use Openwave browsers and their respective versions, see
the Openwave Mobile Browser Phone Reference at <a href="../../../../../../developer.phone.com/resources/phones.html">http://developer.phone.com/resources/phones.html</a>.
</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, Microsoft has thrown its hat into the wireless ring
with its browser, Microsoft Mobile Explorer for cell phones. MME is a
dual-mode browser, supporting both WML and HTML content. The list of
devices that use MME is growing. For more information on MME, see
<a href="../../../../../../www.microsoft.com/mobile/phones/mme/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/mobile/phones/mme/default.asp</a>.
</p>

</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-32-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">32.2.3. Handheld Devices</h3>

<p>There are<a name="INDEX-3023" />
hundreds of mobile devices on the market. Unfortunately, there is no
standard hardware configuration, so it is difficult to anticipate
just how your application will look and work when it reaches the end
user. The following are some device variables WAP developers contend
with:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Screen Size</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Screen <a name="INDEX-3024" />size varies from one device to another.
To give you a ballpark idea, many phone display areas are 95 to 120
pixels wide and 50 to 65 pixels high. Newer phones and PDAs may have
larger screens (approximately 300 <img src="figs/U00D7.gif"> 100 pixels).
</p>


<p>Screen resolution is difficult to pin down. To make matters more
interesting, the Nokia 7110 phone has pixels that are taller than
they are wide (by a ratio of 1.25:1), which can stretch out graphical
images.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Text</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Because WAP content is primarily
<a name="INDEX-3025" />text-based, it may be more meaningful to
measure screen space in terms of number of characters displayed. In
general, mobile browsers can display only 3 to 6 lines of text at a
time with 12 to 20 characters per line.
</p>

<p>Text may be displayed as either monospace, where all characters are
the same width, or proportional, where characters are varying widths.
This can make it difficult to anticipate how many characters will
fall on a line.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Color depth</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The<a name="INDEX-3026" /> vast majority of mobile devices
(particularly in the United States, which lags two years behind the
rest of the world in mobile technology) have 1-bit black and white
LCD displays. As processor power improves, expect to see grayscale
and 8-bit color displays become available in the next few years, as
they already are in Japan.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Softkeys</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Handheld devices typically feature
<em class="firstterm">softkeys</em><a name="INDEX-3027" />, buttons that can be
programmed for application-specific functionality. How many keys are
available, where they are placed, and how they get assigned to
actions in the code varies from device to device. Some softkeys are
just rendered graphically in the display area. This makes it
difficult to anticipate how users will access and navigate through an
application.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-32-SECT-2.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">32.2.4. Size Limitations</h3>

<p>Each <em class="filename">.wml</em> document (called a "deck")
within a WAP application has a maximum permitted size of 1400 bytes,
although most web developers aim to keep the file size below 500
bytes to improve performance. This size limit refers to
<em class="emphasis">compiled</em> decks. Your working documents may be a
bit larger, so keep an eye on the compiled size of your file as
indicated in the emulator or other development tool.
</p>

<p>If your deck is larger than 1400 bytes, you must split it logically
into separate files.
</p>

</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-32-SECT-2.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">32.2.5. WAP Emulators</h3>

<p>WAP<a name="INDEX-3028" />
<a name="INDEX-3029" />
application developers generally use WAP emulators to test their
documents. An emulator (or "simulator") is a program that
runs on your computer that shows you how your document will appear
and function on a wireless device. It alleviates the need to buy a
half-dozen cell phones to test your designs.
</p>

<p>One of the nifty things about emulators is that they look just like
the real thing (see <a href="ch32_02.htm">Figure 32-2</a>) -- you can even
use the buttons to navigate the way you would on a real phone.
Unfortunately, emulators do not always <em class="emphasis">behave</em>
exactly like the real thing. Expect some discrepancies in text layout
and even basic functionality, so be sure to test on real devices
before going live to avoid surprises.

<p>The following are some popular WML emulators and their respective
sites for downloading. The Openwave Simulator is the most popular due
to the widespread use of the Openwave Mobile Browser and its
predecessor, the UP.Browser. All of these programs are Windows-only,
so Mac and Unix users are out of luck.

<a name="ch32-14-fm2xml" /><blockquote><h4>TIP</h4>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-3030" />Opera browser Version 5 features
experimental support for WAP and WML. While it is not a substitute
for a full emulator, it may be useful for testing your WML code or
just viewing other WAP applications. For more information, go to the
Opera web site at <a href="../../../../../../www.opera.com/">http://www.opera.com</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As alternative to a full emulation program, you can view WML pages
using one of the web-based emulators at Wapemulator.com (<a href="../../../../../../www.wapemulator.com/">http://www.wapemulator.com</a>) or Gelon.net
(<a href="../../../../../../www.gelon.net/">http://www.gelon.net</a>). These
emulators are limited in their functionality and accuracy, but they
give you a good general idea and allow you to view WAP applications
from the comfort of your desktop<a name="INDEX-3031" /> computer.

<h4 class="objtitle">About HDML</h4>

<p>Before the WAP Forum hashed out the WAP and WML specifications,
mobile devices received documents formatted in
<a name="INDEX-3032" /> <a name="INDEX-3033" />HDML (Handheld Device
Markup Language). WML, which is XML-based and more robust, officially
replaces HDML, but HDML will be around as long as the older phones
and gadgets that rely on it still linger. HDML is made up of a subset
of HTML and a few extra tags appropriate to navigating with mobile
devices.
</p>

<p>The HDML specification only got as far as "submission"
status at the W3C before it was succeeded by the new and improved
WML. The proposed HDML specification is available at <a href="../../../../../../www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-Submission-HDML-spec.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-Submission-HDML-spec.html</a>.
To serve HDML files, the server must be configured for the MIME type
<tt class="literal">text/x-hdml</tt> and the <em class="filename">.hdml</em>
suffix.
</p>

<p>For an overview of HDML, see the Webmonkey article "Intro to
HDML," located at <a href="../../../../../../hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/99/48/index3a.html">http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/99/48/index3a.html</a>.
</p>

<p>If you already have HDML applications and would like to update them
to WAP/WML, thorough documentation for making the conversion is
available at <a href="../../../../../../developer.phone.com/technotes/hdml2wml/index.html">http://developer.phone.com/technotes/hdml2wml/index.html</a>.
