<h2 class="sect1">3.2. Typography on the Web</h2>

<p>HTML was created with the intent of putting ultimate control of the
presentation in the hands of the end user. This principle makes its
most resounding impact when it comes to typography. Take a look at
your
<a name="INDEX-158" />browser's
preferences and you will find that you (and every other surfer) are
able to specify the fonts and sizes that you prefer for online
viewing.
</p>

<p>For anyone accustomed to designing for other media, this loss of font
control is cause for major frustration. From the time they discovered
the Web, designers (and their corporate clients) have been pushing
for ways to control typography in order to produce attractive and
predictable web sites.
</p>

<p>Great strides have been made in this effort since the early days of
the Web and HTML 1.0; however, as of this writing, the font issue is
still unfolding. This section discusses possible strategies and
technologies (along with their advantages and disadvantages) for
designing type in web documents.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.2.1. You Have Two Fonts</h3>

<p>About the only thing you can be sure of when you're designing
web pages with basic HTML is that you have two fonts to work with: a
proportional font and a fixed-width font. The problem is that you
don't know specifically which fonts these are or at what size
they will be displayed.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-2.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.2.1.1. Proportional font</h3>

<p>A <em class="firstterm">proportional
font</em><a name="INDEX-159" /> (called "Variable Width Font"
in Netscape Navigator) is one that allots different amounts of space
to each character, based on its design. For instance, in a
proportional font, a capital "W" takes up more horizontal
space on the line than a lowercase "i". Times, Helvetica,
and Arial are proportional fonts.
</p>

<p>Web browsers use a proportional font for the majority of text in the
web page, including body text, headings, lists, blockquotes, etc. In
general, proportional fonts are easier to read for large bodies of
text.
</p>

<p>Because the majority of users do not take the time to change the
default font in their browser preferences, you can make a
<em class="emphasis">very</em> broad assumption that most of the text on
your page will be displayed in 10- or 12-point Times (Navigator
default) or Helvetica (the default in Microsoft Internet Explorer).
Remember, this is only a very general guideline.
</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-2.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.2.1.2. Fixed-width font</h3>

<p><em class="firstterm">Fixed-width
fonts</em><a name="INDEX-160" />
(also known as "<a name="INDEX-161" />constant-width" or
"<a name="INDEX-162" />monospace" fonts) are designed to
allot the same amount of horizontal space to all characters in the
font. A capital "W" takes up no more or less space than a
lowercase "i". Examples of fixed-width fonts are Courier
and Monaco.
</p>

<p>Web browsers use fixed-width font to render type within the following
HTML tags:
</p>

<a name="ch03-9-fm2xml" /><table cellpadding=3 border="1">



<tr>
<td>
<p><tt class="literal">&lt;pre&gt;</tt></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Preformatted text</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><tt class="literal">&lt;tt&gt;</tt></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Typewriter text</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><tt class="literal">&lt;code&gt;</tt></p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><tt class="literal">&lt;xmp&gt;</tt></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Example text</p>
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Again, because most people do not change the default font settings in
their browser preferences, you can make a reasonable guess that text
marked with the above HTML tags will be displayed in some variation
of <a name="INDEX-163" />Courier.

<h3 class="sect2">3.2.2. Text in Graphics</h3>

<p>Designers<a name="INDEX-164" /> <a name="INDEX-165" /> <a name="INDEX-166" />
quickly<a name="INDEX-167" /> learned that
the sure-fire way to have absolute control over font display is to
set the text in a graphic. It is common to see headlines, subheads,
and call-outs rendered as <a name="INDEX-168" />GIF files. Some web pages are made up
exclusively of graphics that contain all the text for the page.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-2.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.2.2.1. Advantages of GIF text </h3>

<p>The advantage to using graphics instead of HTML text is fairly
obvious -- control!
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>You can specify text font, size, leading, letter spacing, color, and
alignment -- all attributes that are problematic in HTML alone.
</p>

<p>Everyone with a graphical browser will see your page the same way.</p>

<h3 class="sect3">3.2.2.2. Disadvantages of GIF text </h3>

<p>As enticing as this technique may seem, it has many serious
drawbacks. Many professional sites have adopted a "no text in
graphics" rule. Keep the following disadvantages in mind when
deciding whether to use graphics for your text.
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Graphics take longer to download than text. Graphics are likely to be
many orders of magnitude larger than HTML text with the same content,
and will result in slower downloads.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Content is lost on nongraphical browsers. People who cannot (or have
chosen not to) view graphics will see no content. Alternative text
(using the <tt class="literal">alt</tt> attribute) in place of graphics
helps, but this is a limited solution and not always reliable.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Information in graphics cannot be indexed, searched, or copied and
pasted. In effect, by putting text in a graphic, you are removing
useful pieces of information from your document. Again, the
<tt class="literal">alt</tt> attribute helps here.

<h3 class="sect2">3.2.3. Why Specifying Type Is Problematic </h3>

<p>Cascading<a name="INDEX-169" /> <a name="INDEX-170" />
Style Sheets and the nonstandard
<tt class="literal">&lt;font&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-171" /> tag give web designers an added level
of control over typography by enabling the specification of fonts and
sizes. Although it is a step in the right direction, using these tags
by no means guarantees that your readers will see the page exactly
the way you've designed it.
</p>

<p>Specifying fonts and sizes for use on web pages is made difficult by
the fact that browsers are limited to displaying fonts that are
already installed on the user's local hard drive. So, even
though you've specified text to be displayed in the Georgia
font, if users do not have Georgia installed on their machines, they
will see the text in whatever their default font happens to be.
Fortunately, HTML allows you to specify backup fonts if your first
choice is not found (this technique is described in <a href="ch10_05.htm">Section 10.5.2, "Specifying Fonts with &lt;font&gt;"</a> of <a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "Formatting Text"</a>). 
</p>

<p>Platforms also handle type size display in different ways. Using
style sheets and the <tt class="literal">&lt;font&gt;</tt> tag is more like
<em class="emphasis">recommending</em> fonts and sizes than actually
specifying them.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-2.3.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.2.3.1. Type size</h3>

<p>Traditionally, <a name="INDEX-172" />type size
is specified in points (there are approximately 72 points per inch),
but unfortunately, point sizes do not translate well between
platforms. In part, this is because their operating systems drive
monitors at different resolutions. Typically, Windows uses 96ppi for
screen resolution and the Mac OS uses 72ppi, but multiscan monitors
allow higher resolutions.
</p>

<p>On a Mac, a font is displayed at roughly the same size at which it
would appear in print (e.g., 12pt Times on screen looks like 12pt
Times on paper). Microsoft, however, threw out that convention and
chose to display point sizes larger to make it easier to read on a
monitor. As a result, 12pt type on a Windows machine is closer to
16pt type in print. To get 12pt print-size type on Windows, you need
to specify a point size of 9 (but then Mac users will see that text
at a nearly illegible 6.75pt type).

<h3 class="sect3">3.2.3.2. Selecting fonts for web pages</h3>

<p>Each <a name="INDEX-173" />platform has its own set of standard fonts
(and font file formats), making it difficult to specify any one font
that will be found universally. Although there are many commercial
fonts available for both Mac and PC, you can't assume that your
audience will have them. The majority of users are likely to be
content with the collection of fonts that are installed with their
systems. <a href="ch03_02.htm">Table 3-1</a> lists the fonts that are

<h3 class="sect3">3.2.3.3. Core fonts for the Web from Microsoft</h3>

<p>The<a name="INDEX-174" />
problem with reading text on web pages is that many fonts (most
notably the ubiquitous Times) are difficult to read at small sizes.
The serifs that aid readability in print are actually a hindrance
when rendered with a limited number of black and white pixels.
</p>

<p>Responding to the need for fonts that are easy to read on the screen,
Microsoft has created a collection of <a name="INDEX-175" />TrueType fonts (for both
Windows and Mac) that have been specially designed to be optimized
for on-screen viewing. They distribute them for free with the hope
that they might grow to be standard and "safe" fonts to
specify in web documents. The Microsoft web fonts currently include:
</p>

<blockquote class="simplelist">
<p>Andale Mono (formerly Monotype.com)</p>
<p>Arial</p>
<p>Comic Sans</p>
<p>Courier New</p>
<p>Impact</p>
<p>Times New Roman</p>
<p>Trebuchet MS</p>
<p>Webdings (Windows only) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These fonts have generous character spacing, large x-heights, and
open, rounded features that make them better for online reading.
Georgia and Verdana were designed by esteemed type designer Matthew
Carter, with hinting provided by Vincent Connare (who also designed
Comic Sans and Trebuchet MS).

<h3 class="sect2">3.2.4. Embedded Fonts</h3>

<p>Both Navigator and Internet Explorer support technologies for
<a name="INDEX-178" />
<a name="INDEX-179" />
<a name="INDEX-180" />embedding
fonts in a web page, enabling your viewers to see your page exactly
as you have designed it. Because the font travels with the HTML file,
it is not necessary for the user to have the font installed on the
client end in order for specified fonts to display. A few years ago,
there was a fair amount of excitement about embedded fonts, but the
interest has since waned and we are now left with two poorly
supported and incompatible standards. In fact, Netscape opted to no
longer support embedded fonts in its Version 6 release.
</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, Netscape and Microsoft have lined up with competing
technologies. <a name="INDEX-181" />Netscape,
partnering with <a name="INDEX-182" />Bitstream (a font design company),
created <a name="INDEX-183" />TrueDoc Dynamic fonts. Microsoft and
<a name="INDEX-184" />Adobe worked together to develop
Embedded OpenType.
</p>

<p>Both technologies work basically the same way: a special font
embedding tool is used to compress the type into a downloadable font
file. This font file is referenced by the HTML document using the
<tt class="literal">&lt;link&gt;</tt> tag. To use the font, just call it by
name using Cascading Style Sheets or the
<tt class="literal">&lt;font&gt;</tt> tag in the document. Users with
browsers that support embedded font technology see your special
fonts; otherwise, text is rendered in the browser's default
font.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-2.4.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.2.4.1. TrueDoc Technology ("Dynamic Fonts")</h3>

<p>TrueDoc technology was developed by Bitstream in 1994, and in 1996,
Netscape included "<a name="INDEX-185" />Dynamic Font" support in the
Navigator 4.0 browser. Dynamic fonts are saved in the
<a name="INDEX-186" /> <a name="INDEX-187" />Portable Font Resource
(<em class="filename">.pfr</em>) format. To create them, it is recommended
that you use <a name="INDEX-188" />WebFont Wizard from Bitstream (available
for both Windows and Mac; see Bitstream's web site at
<a href="../../../../../../www.truedoc.com/">http://www.truedoc.com</a>).
</p>

<p>Browser support for TrueDoc is slightly better than its competitor
but is still problematic. Dynamic fonts can be viewed on Navigator
4.x for Windows, Mac, and Unix, and Internet Explorer 4+ for Windows
only. Internet Explorer users must download an ActiveX control for
the WebFont Player in order to view Dynamic Fonts. Although dynamic
fonts can be viewed on IE5.5, they cannot be printed. Netscape 6 has
dropped embedded font support on all platforms, so TrueDoc works only
on Netscape Version 4.x.
</p>

<p>For more information on TrueDoc technology, see Bitstream's web
site.

(<em class="filename">.eot</em>) file format, which can be created with
Microsoft's <a name="INDEX-192" /> <a name="INDEX-193" />WEFT (Web Embedding Font Tool). WEFT
