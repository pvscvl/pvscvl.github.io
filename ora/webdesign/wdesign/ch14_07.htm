<h2 class="sect1">14.7. Frame Design Tips and Tricks</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-1629" />Using frames effectively requires
more than just knowing the HTML tags. This section provides a few
pointers and tricks for framed documents.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-14-SECT-7.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.7.1. All-Purpose Pages</h3>

<p>Designing a web page to be part of a framed document doesn't
guarantee that it will always be viewed that way. Keep in mind that
some users might end up looking at one of your pages on its own, out
of the context of its frameset (this is possible if a search engine
returns the URL of the content, for example). Since frames are often
used for navigation, this orphaned content page could be a big, fat
dead-end for a user.
</p>

<p>For that reason, you should try to design your content pages so that
they stand up on their own. Adding a small amount of redundant
information to the bottom of each page can make a big difference in
usability. First, indicate the name of the site with a link to its
home page on each content document. This helps to orient a newcomer
who may have just dropped in from a search engine.
</p>

<p>It is important to pay particular attention to the navigational
options available on content pages viewed without their frameset. At
the very least, provide a small link on every page to a more
appropriate (and framed) starting point, such as the top level of
your site. Be sure to set the <tt class="literal">target="_top"</tt>
attribute so the link won't load the home page frameset within
the current frameset.
</p>

<p>As a backup measure, you could use JavaScript to ensure that a page
is always viewed in its original frameset. This technique is
discussed under <a href="ch14_07.htm">Section 14.7.9, "Keeping Pages in Their Frames"</a> later in
this chapter.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">14.7.2. External Links</h3>

<p>In most cases, it is not appropriate to load whole external sites
into the context of another framed document. By default, any link
within a frame loads the new document into that same frame. To
prevent external links from loading into the current frame, be sure
to add <tt class="literal">target="_top"</tt> to all your external links;
the new site will open in the full browser window. As an alternative,
set the target to <tt class="literal">"_blank"</tt> to open the link in a
new browser window.
</p>

</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-14-SECT-7.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.7.3. Helping Search Engines</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1630" />Search engines all work
differently but pretty much uniformly do not understand frames or any
content within a <tt class="literal">&lt;frameset&gt;</tt> or
<tt class="literal">&lt;frame&gt;</tt> tag. This means search engines will
not find any links that require burrowing through a site for indexing
purposes, and all the content of your framed site will be missed.
</p>

<p>There are a few measures you can take to make your site more friendly
to search engines:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Include content in the frameset
document.</b> Search engines read content within the
<tt class="literal">&lt;noframes&gt;</tt> tag. It is a good idea to make it
as descriptive as possible so search engines have something to index
(instead of just "you need frames to see this site").
Adding a link within the noframes text to the HTML file containing
all your navigational links helps search engines (and humans!) get to
the content of your site without relying on the frameset.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Use descriptive titles.</b>
<a name="INDEX-1631" /> <a name="INDEX-1632" />Titles
are the most important things that search engines index, so use
descriptive titles on all content documents. Document titles do not
display when the document is loaded into a frame, so it doesn't
affect your frame design.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Use</b> <a name="INDEX-1633" /><tt class="literal">&lt;meta&gt;</tt><b class="emphasis-bold"> tags.</b> Although not all search engines use
<tt class="literal">&lt;meta&gt;</tt> tag information, they can be a useful
tool for those that do. If your top-level frameset document contains
limited content within the <tt class="literal">&lt;noframes&gt;</tt> tag,
you can add a site description and keywords to the page via
<tt class="literal">&lt;meta&gt;</tt> tags for the search engine to index.
The <tt class="literal">&lt;meta&gt;</tt> element is fully discussed in
<a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Structural HTML Tags"</a>. The following is a sample of standard
<tt class="literal">&lt;meta&gt;</tt> tags used to aid search engines:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Littlechair Studios&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;META name="description" content="Jennifer Niederst's resume and web design samples."&gt;
&lt;META name="keywords" content="designer, web design, training, interface design"&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;</pre></blockquote>
</li></ul>

<p>For more information about search engines and how they work, see the
Search Engine Watch site at <a href="../../../../../../www.searchenginewatch.com/">http://www.searchenginewatch.com</a> (from which
the previous information was gathered).

<h3 class="sect2">14.7.4. Loading Two Frames from One Link</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1634" />
<a name="INDEX-1635" /> <a name="INDEX-1636" />
<a name="INDEX-1637" />Ordinarily, a link can target only one
frame, but there are a few options for creating links that change the
contents of two frames at once. One involves simple HTML and the
others use JavaScript controls.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-14-SECT-7.4.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">14.7.4.1. Loading a framed document</h3>

<p>In HTML, you can only load one document with a link, and that
document can occupy just one window or frame. Loading two or more
frames (essentially two documents) with a single click requires a bit
of fakery. What you're actually doing is loading a single
document that is divided into frames itself. What the user sees is a
number of frames being replaced at once.
</p>

<p>This effect cannot be achieved by nesting framesets as shown in <a href="ch14_03.htm">Figure 14-4</a>. Instead, the nesting happens as a product of
a framed external document loading into a single frame.
</p>

<p>For instance, the following code creates a frameset with two frames:
a narrow "top" frame and a "main" bottom
frame. This frameset is called <em class="filename">top.html.</em>
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;FRAMESET ROWS=50,*&gt;
&lt;FRAME SRC="toolbar.html" NAME="top"&gt;
&lt;FRAME SRC="two_frames.html" NAME="main"&gt;
&lt;/FRAMESET&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The bottom frame displays the contents of a document with two
vertical frames called <em class="filename">two_frames.html</em>, shown
here:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;FRAMESET COLS=250,*&gt;
&lt;FRAME SRC="left.html" NAME="leftframe"&gt;
&lt;FRAME SRC="right.html" NAME="rightframe"&gt;
&lt;/FRAMESET&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>It is assumed that there are a number of documents like
<em class="filename">two_frames.html</em> that can be accessed by links in
the top frame. Each link from the top frame loads one document in the
"main" frame, but the contents of two frames change at
once.
</p>

<p>Of course, this method works only for neighboring frames.</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-14-SECT-7.4.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">14.7.4.2. Loading two frames with JavaScript</h3>

<p>Adding an <tt class="literal">onClick</tt><a name="INDEX-1638" />
<a name="INDEX-1639" /> JavaScript command
within the link allows the browser to load documents into two frames
based on one mouse click.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a>
For this example, imagine a document that contains two frames, a list
of options on the left and the contents in the main window on the
right. We want a link in the left frame to change the contents on the
right, but also to load a new list of options (perhaps with the
current choice highlighted) into the left frame. The code is quite
simple:
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-7" /><p>[7]This tip was gathered from
Webmonkey, an online magazine for web developers; see <a href="../../../../../../www.webmonkey.com/">http://www.webmonkey.com</a>.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;A HREF="content.html" <tt class="userinput"><b>onClick="window.self.location='newlist.html'"</b></tt> 
TARGET="display"&gt;Chocolate&lt;/a&gt; </pre></blockquote>

<p>The text in bold is the JavaScript line that tells the browser to
load <em class="filename">newlist.html</em> into the same window/frame as
the link. The remaining code is the standard HTML link that will load
<em class="filename">content.html</em> into the display frame on the
right.
</p>

<p>Another (and more robust) method for changing two frames with one
click uses a function that changes the contents of two frames (named
"toolbar" and "main"), as shown in this
sample code:<a name="INDEX-1640" />
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!--
function changePages (toolbarURL, mainURL) {
parent.toolbar.location.href=toolbarURL; 
parent.main.location.href=mainURL;
}
--&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Within the anchor tag, the additional code provides the URLs for the
documents that will be used in the script (and loaded into the
respective frames), as shown in the following example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;A HREF="javascript:changePages('toolbar_document2.html',
'main_document 2.html');"&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that if JavaScript is turned off in
the user's browser, this link will have no effect; therefore,
you should use this method cautiously.

<p><a name="INDEX-1641" /> <a name="INDEX-1642" /> <a name="INDEX-1643" />
<a name="INDEX-1644" /> <a name="INDEX-1645" />Inline (floating) frames are really
cool, but unfortunately, they are not supported in all browsers
(Navigator 4.7 and earlier lack support). The following code gives
the effect of an inline frame using standard frames tags (but, of
course, without all the text-wrap functionality). It creates a
scrolling frame that is always centered in the browser window,
regardless of how the window is resized, as shown in <a href="ch14_07.htm">Figure 14-10</a>.
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;FRAMESET COLS="*,<b class="emphasis-bold">130</b>,*" NORESIZE BORDER=0 FRAMEBORDER=0 FRAMEBORDER=no FRAMESPACING=0&gt;
   &lt;FRAME SRC="black.html" SCROLLING=no&gt;
   &lt;FRAMESET ROWS="*,<b class="emphasis-bold">90</b>,*"  NORESIZE BORDER=0 FRAMEBORDER=0  
    FRAMEBORDER=no FRAMESPACING=0&gt;

     <b class="emphasis-bold"> &lt;FRAME SRC="pix.html" SCROLLING=auto MARGINWIDTH=0</b> 
<b class="emphasis-bold">       MARGINHEIGHT=0&gt;</b>
      &lt;FRAME SRC="black.html" SCROLLING=no&gt;
   &lt;/FRAMESET&gt;
   &lt;FRAME SRC="black.html" SCROLLING=no&gt;
&lt;/FRAMESET&gt; </pre></blockquote>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-14-FIG-10" /><div class="figure"><img height="182" alt="Figure 14-10" src="figs/WDN2_1410.gif" width="232" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 14-10. Scrolling frame centered in the browser window</h4>

<p>The middle column setting in the first
<tt class="literal">&lt;frameset&gt;</tt> is the width of the window in
pixels. The middle row setting in the nested
<tt class="literal">&lt;frameset&gt;</tt> gives the window's height.
You can change the size of the window by adjusting these settings.
You can also set the scrolling function of the frame in its
<tt class="literal">&lt;frame&gt;</tt> tag.
</p>

<p>In this example, all the remaining frames are filled with an HTML
file with no contents and a black background. Of course, these frames
could contain actual content as well.

<h3 class="sect2">14.7.6. Frame-Proof Your Site</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1646" />
<a name="INDEX-1647" />Some sites may link to your
site and load it into a single frame in their interface. If you
really don't want to see your site squished into someone
else's frame, you can add this tricky (yet simple) JavaScript
to the <tt class="literal">&lt;head&gt;</tt> of your document, which makes
your page always load into the top level of the browser window. (This
script works for Netscape Navigator 3.0 and higher and Internet
Explorer 3.0 and higher.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-8">[8]</a>)

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JAVASCRIPT"&gt;

<h3 class="sect2">14.7.7. Preloading Images with Hidden Frames</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1648" />
<a name="INDEX-1649" />
<a name="INDEX-1650" />
<a name="INDEX-1651" />
<a name="INDEX-1652" />"Preloading images" refers to
methods used to download images and store them in the cache before
they actually need to be displayed on the page. One method for doing
this is to place all the images you'd like to download in a
framed document that is hidden from view. The images download and are
cached when the first frameset is loaded, but they won't be
seen until the user links to a visible page that includes them.
</p>

<p>The trick is to create a frameset with two rows (or columns). Set the
size of the first row to 100% -- this is the frame that will be
used to display your first page. In the second row, the one that gets
squeezed out of existence, specify the document that contains your
images.
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;FRAMESET ROWS="100%,0" NORESIZE BORDER=0
   FRAMEBORDER=0 FRAMEBORDER=NO FRAMESPACING=0&gt;
   &lt;FRAME SRC="firstpage.html"&gt;
   &lt;FRAME SRC="thepictures.html"&gt;
&lt;/FRAMESET&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>You can put a bunch of images there, but keep in mind that it's
not a free download, just a predownload, so all the same rules about
minimizing file sizes apply. There's always the chance that the
user might request one of the images (via a link or by moving to a
web page that contains it) before they've all arrived.

<h3 class="sect2">14.7.8. Frames in WebTV</h3>

<p>While <a name="INDEX-1653" />
<a name="INDEX-1654" />WebTV technically supports frames (i.e,
it can display the information in a framed document), it does so by
converting the framed document into a large table. Each
"frame" (more like a table cell) displays the entire
contents of the frame source. If a frame contains an HTML document
that is quite long, the resulting "frame" in WebTV will
be extended to display the entire file, regardless of the specified
frame size. There is no scrolling function in WebTV.
</p>

<p>In addition, WebTV "frames" do not remain in a fixed
position like normal frames, but instead move off the screen when
users page down through the content.
</p>

<p>Frames done with JavaScript links (such as those discussed previously
in this chapter) will break navigation in WebTV. If your site targets
WebTV users, be sure to either keep frames simple or not use them at
all.
</p>

<p>For more information on WebTV's handling of frames, see

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-14-SECT-7.9" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.7.9. Keeping Pages in Their Frames</h3>

<p>In some cases, users might come across a content document independent
of the frameset that is intended to contain it (such as from a link
in search engine results). To prevent your content pages from
appearing out of context, use this JavaScript code in the head of any
document that needs to appear in a frameset:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!-- 
if (top.location == self.location) {
	self.location.replace("frameset.html")
}
// --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;	 </pre></blockquote>

<p>The first line of the script checks to see if the topmost frame of
the current window is the document. If it is, the second line of the
script instructs the browser to replace the document with the
frameset document (<em class="filename">frameset.html</em> in this
example, but fill in your own file name in this location).
</p>

</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-14-SECT-7.10" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.7.10. Frame Sizes in Netscape Navigator</h3>

<p>Some<a name="INDEX-1655" /> framed page designs rely on precise
pixel measurements to achieve a desired effect. While Internet
Explorer (all versions) and Netscape 6 do not have a problem
rendering frames with pixel accuracy, this is not the case for
Netscape Navigator Versions 4.7 and earlier. They handle frames in a
way that makes it nearly impossible to get the frame sizes you
specify.
</p>

<p>The reason is that Navigator's frame code (developed way back
for Version 2.0) records all frame dimensions in percentages. Any
pixel measurements provided in the rows or columns attributes are
calculated as a percentage of the available screen space and then
rounded off to the nearest percentage point. The rounding results in
the rendered frame being up to 12 pixels different (usually smaller)
than the specified size. If alignment is crucial for your design, 12
pixels of shift may be unacceptable.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is not much that you can do about this other
than to use JavaScript to specify a new window with known
<tt class="literal">innerWidth</tt> and <tt class="literal">innerHeight</tt>
measurements, and then base your frame measurements on even
percentages of those values. Otherwise, you may want to simply avoid
pixel-dependent frame designs.
</p>

<p>On the bright side, this problem was fixed in Netscape 6, and the
older versions of Navigator make up an ever-diminishing percentage of
overall browser use. Eventually this will be a non-issue, but in the
meantime, just be aware that if your frames are misbehaving, it may
be Navigator and not your code<a name="INDEX-1656" /> that's to<a name="INDEX-1657" /> blame.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a>
