<h2 class="sect1">24.3. Preparing Your Own Audio</h2>

<p>Recording and producing your own audio requires a significant
investment in hardware, software, and time spent learning. If you
need to put professional-quality audio on your site but aren't
likely to make the investment in time and equipment yourself,
consider outsourcing the work to professionals.
</p>

<p>The final product may be anything from a simple personal greeting to
a live concert broadcast. The preparation of original audio requires
a number of standard steps: recording, basic sound editing, then
optimization for web delivery.

<h3 class="sect2">24.3.1. Recording</h3>

<p>The<a name="INDEX-2590" /> first step is to make a recording of the
music, spoken word, or sound effects for your site. As for most
things, when it comes to sound quality, you get what you pay for. It
is possible to capture sound using available resources (like the
microphone that came with your computer), but the quality will not be
appropriate for a professional site. The cost of recording equipment
escalates quickly for each level of sound quality. An investment of
$800 to $4000 in equipment (not counting the computer) is enough to
get started on creating a home (or small business) studio. Getting a
studio up and running also requires investments of time, effort, and
education.
</p>

<p>Although this may be a good choice for a business, it may be too
expensive for many hobbyists and garage bands. It may be more
cost-effective for an individual or organization on a strict budget
or tight deadline to hire the services of a professional studio.
Depending on how well the studio is equipped, it can cost from $30 to
$250 per hour, and up.

<p>Onc<a name="INDEX-2591" />e
you've recorded raw audio, the next step is to clean up the
recording. This can involve removing unwanted sounds, setting the
beginning and end of the file, and/or making a loop. You may want to
apply digital effects to the sound, such as reverb or a delay.
</p>

<p>Consider also using mastering processing techniques such as
normalization or compression that can balance out the level of your
audio such that no part is too loud or too quiet.
</p>

<p>There is a huge selection of software for audio editing and format
conversion. The software ranges from single-purpose utilities
available via free download to professional digital-audio editing
suites costing thousands of dollars. Some popular professional-level
tools are listed in the following sections.

<h3 class="sect2">24.3.3. Optimizing for the Web</h3>

<p>After the sound files have been recorded and edited, it is time to
convert them to their target web audio format and make them as small
as possible for web delivery. The tool you use may depend on the file
format. For instance, RealAudio and LiquidAudio have their own
creation tools. There are also several tools specialized for the
creation of MP3s. Tools are discussed with their respective file
formats later in this chapter.
</p>

<p>One great all-purpose tool is Cleaner 5, from Terran Interactive
available for the Mac and Windows systems. This program is designed
to get the best quality files at the smallest size in whatever format
you choose. Cleaner can compress a number of file formats, including
Quicktime and RealMedia. It can also do batch processing. The program
sells for $599 as of this writing. (Cleaner is the newer and renamed
version of MediaCleanerPro.)
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2609" />
<a name="INDEX-2610" />Regardless of the tool you use, there
are standard ways to reduce the size of an audio file so it is
appropriate for downloading via a web page. Not surprisingly, this
usually requires sacrificing quality. The aspects of the audio file
you can control are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Length of the audio clip</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2611" />It might seem obvious, but you should
keep the audio sample as short as possible. For example, consider
providing just part of a song rather than the whole thing. If you are
recording a greeting, make it short and sweet.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Number of channels</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2612" />A mono audio
file requires half the disk space of a stereo file and and may be
adequate for some audio uses.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Bit depth </b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2613" />Audio files for the Web are often saved
at 8 bits, which will result in a file that is half the size of a
16-bit file. MP3s can handle 16-bit due to their efficient
compression.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Sampling rate</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2614" />
<a name="INDEX-2615" />
<a name="INDEX-2616" />Cutting the sampling rate in half will
cut the file size in half (e.g., a sampling rate of 22.05 KHz
requires half the data than one of 44.1 KHz). As a general guideline,
audio files that are voice-only can be reduced down to 8 KHz. Sound
effects work at 8 Khz or 11.025 KHz. Music sounds acceptable at 22
Khz.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Using these guidelines, if we start with a one-minute music sample at
CD quality (10 MB) and change it to a mono, 8-bit, 22 Khz WAV file,
its size is reduced to 1.25 MB, which is much more reasonable for
downloading. Using MP3 compression, we can keep the quality of that
one-minute sample at 16-bit, 44.1 kHz stereo (similar to CD quality)
with a resulting file size of under 1MB. Combining these methods (a
mono, 8-bit, 22Khz MP3), you can offer one minute clips at acceptable
audio quality at only a few hundred K.
</p>

<p>Obviously, just how stingy you can be with your settings while
retaining acceptable quality depends on the individual audio file.
You should certainly do some testing to see how small you can make
the file without sacrificing essential audio detail.
