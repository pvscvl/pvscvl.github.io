<h2 class="sect1">5.4. Portable Document Format (PDF)</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-387" />PDF (Portable
Document Format) i<a name="INDEX-388" />s a
technology developed by Adobe for sharing electronic documents. The
remarkable thing about PDF files is that they preserve the fonts,
colors, formatting, and graphics of the original source document.
Ideally, a PDF document looks exactly the way it was designed,
regardless of the platform, hardware, and software environment of the
end user. It can be viewed on the screen or printed out to a
high-quality hard copy.
</p>

<p>PDF existed before the Web, but the two make great partners -- PDF
is the ideal file format for sharing documents, and the Web provides
a highly accessible network for distributing them. You can make any
document into a PDF file and make it available from a web page. The
advantage, of course, is that you have more control over fonts and
layout, and the formatting is not limited by HTML.
</p>

<p>Forms, documentation, and any other materials that rely on specific
formatting are good candidates for PDF files. To use a classic
example, the IRS makes tax forms available for download in PDF format
so taxpayers can print them out at home without requesting them by
mail or making a trip to the post office.
</p>

<p>But PDF files are not totally static. They can contain links to
online material and other PDF files. Adobe Acrobat 5 can even create
interactive PDF forms which can be filled out, automatically updated,
and submitted online. PDFs can also be dynamically generated based on
user input.
</p>

<p>With the control PDF offers over display, it's tempting to want
to use it for all online material. It's important to understand
that PDF is not a substitute for HTML, nor is it likely ever to be.
But it is a powerful tool for sharing any sort of document
electronically. It's like sending a piece of paper through the
lines.

<h3 class="sect2">5.4.1. Viewing PDF Files</h3>

<p>PDFs<a name="INDEX-389" />
are viewed and printed via the freely available and widely
distributed Acrobat Reader. <a name="INDEX-390" />Acrobat Reader is also available as a
plug-in (called
<a name="INDEX-391" />PDFViewer) or
<a name="INDEX-392" />ActiveX control that is automatically
installed with Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator Versions 3.0
and higher on a variety of platforms including Windows, Mac, and
Unix.
</p>

<p>When a user clicks on a link to a PDF file from a web page, what
happens depends on how the browser is configured. If the browser has
the PDFViewer plug-in, the document displays right in the browser
window; the plug-in adds a toolbar to the browser window for
navigating through the PDF document. If the browser is configured to
use Acrobat Reader as a helper application, the browser automatically
launches the reader, and the PDF displays in the separate application
window.
</p>

<p>Without the Reader or plug-in, when a browser encounters a PDF file,
it issues a prompt to install the plug-in, choose a helper
application, or save the file to disk.
</p>

</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-5-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.4.2. Creating PDF Files</h3>

<p>The standard application for creating PDF files is Adobe Acrobat,
which is in Version 5 as of this writing. This commercial product
gives publishers the greatest control over PDF creation.
</p>

<p>When Acrobat is installed on a computer, making PDFs is simple. From
an Adobe application, just open the document and export it to the PDF
format. In Microsoft Office (Windows only), there is a PDF Maker icon
right on the toolbar. To create a PDF from a non-Adobe application,
print it to a PostScript file (choose "File" instead of
"Printer" in the Print dialog box). Then open the
PostScript file in Acrobat Distiller (part of the Acrobat package)
and save it as a PDF file. In both scenarios, a dialog box appears,
in which you can specify a large number of quality and optimization
settings.
</p>

<p>Once the PDF file has been created, it can then be opened in Acrobat
for further fine-tuning and advanced settings. See the
<a name="INDEX-393" />Adobe web site (<a href="../../../../../../www.adobe.com/">http://www.adobe.com</a>) or the Acrobat
documentation for more information on creating and fine-tuning PDF
files.
</p>

<p>The important thing to remember is that the PDF file needs to be
optimized for web delivery, so be sure to check the
"Optimized" box in whatever program you use to create
your PDFs. Optimizing the PDF structures the document and the media
it contains so that it can be delivered page by page. It also results
in much smaller file sizes. When you save the PDF, be sure that you
give it the proper <em class="filename">.pdf</em> suffix.
</p>

<h4 class="objtitle">Alternatives to Acrobat</h4>

<p>Acrobat is not your only option for converting your files to PDF.
Because PDF is an open source technology, Adobe has opened the door
to third-party developers who want to support the ability to create
PDFs. These include shareware programs, Perl scripts, and even
printer driver-based tools that fool your programs into thinking they
are printing to a printer, when in fact they are creating a PDF file.
A good place to look for PDF-related tools is PlanetPDF (<a href="../../../../../../www.planetpdf.com/">http://www.planetpdf.com</a>).
</p>

<p>There are also online conversion services: you upload your file and
it is converted for you for a small fee or subscription. Adobe has
its own conversion service called Create Adobe PDF Online that
charges a monthly fee, but your first three conversions are free. It
is available at <a href="../../../../../../cpdf.adobe.com/">http://cpdf.adobe.com</a>. Even better, check out
Gohtm.com (<a href="../../../../../../www.gohtm.com/">http://www.gohtm.com</a>),
where they convert your documents to PDF for free!
</p>

<p>These services may be a good alternative if you only need to create
PDFs occasionally. If you plan to make PDFs part of your publishing
process, Acrobat is a good investment because of the advanced
features it offers.

<h3 class="sect2">5.4.3. HTML for Adding PDF Files to Web Pages</h3>

<p>There<a name="INDEX-394" /> <a name="INDEX-395" /> are two basic ways of calling a PDF file
from a web page: linking to the file (or a specific page within it)
and embedding it in the page like an image.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-5-SECT-4.3.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.4.3.1. Linking to a PDF file</h3>

<p>Creating a link to a PDF file is the same as linking to any other
document. Just include the file name in the URL as shown in this
example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;A HREF="documentation.pdf"&gt;Link to PDF file&lt;/A&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The PDF file resides on the server like any other media file. Most
modern server software is preconfigured to recognize the PDF MIME
type (type <tt class="literal">application/pdf</tt>, extension
<em class="filename">.pdf</em>).
</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-5-SECT-4.3.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.4.3.2. Linking to a specific page in a PDF file</h3>

<p>It is possible to create a hypertext link to a specific page in a PDF
document, allowing readers to jump just to the relevant information
without waiting for the entire PDF document to download. It's a
useful feature, but a number of criteria must be met in order for it
to work:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The server must support
<em class="firstterm">byteserving</em><a name="INDEX-396" />, a feature on web servers
that allows them to deliver one page of the PDF file at a time.
Byteserving is supported on the following servers: Microsoft Internet
Information Server, Netscape Enterprise and Fastrack Servers, Apache,
and Starnine Webster 3.0 (for Mac).
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The user's browser must be Netscape Navigator or Microsoft
Internet Explorer Version 3.0 or higher.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The user must have the Acrobat Plug-in or ActiveX control installed
in the browser so that PDF files are displayed within the browser
window.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Assuming all these elements are in place, it is easy to create the
PDF and link to it. With the PDF document open in Acrobat, create a
new destination at the page you want to link to and give it a logical
name (e.g., <em class="filename">section3</em>). Add destinations with the
Destinations palette (Window <img alt="Figure 5.4.3.2" src="figs/U2192.gif" /> Choose Destinations). Repeat for
additional destinations. When you save the PDF file, be sure to check
the Optimized checkbox. Optimizing the PDF file structures it page by
page.
</p>

<p>In the HTML document, make a link to the PDF file and the specific
destination. The section name is separated from the file name by a
hash symbol (<tt class="literal">#</tt>), as shown in this example:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;A HREF="article.pdf#section3"&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>For more information on page-serving PDF files, see the Adobe.com
tutorial at <a href="../../../../../../www.adobe.com/epaper/tips/acrlongpdf/main.html">http://www.adobe.com/epaper/tips/acrlongpdf/main.html</a>.

</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-5-SECT-4.3.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">5.4.3.3. Embedding a PDF file</h3>

<p>A single-page <a name="INDEX-397" />PDF file
can be embedded in a web page just like an image using the
<tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;IMG SRC="directions.pdf" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="400"&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>If a multipage PDF document is embedded in a web page, only the first
page is displayed, without an Acrobat navigation toolbar. It is
treated just like a static graphic. It is also advisable to list the
file size of the file next to the link so users can make an informed
decision whether to download it.
</p>

<p>If the user clicks on the embedded PDF image, however, it launches
the Acrobat Reader, where the multipage document is fully functional.
This technique can be used to show a thumbnail of the PDF file before
the file itself is opened.

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-5-SECT-4.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.4.4. Tips for Linking to PDF Files</h3>

<p>As for any large media file, it is good web design etiquette to
provide some indication of what users will get when they click on a
link to a PDF file. The file format itself can be shown with a small
PDF icon, by writing out the name of the file with its
<em class="filename">.pdf</em> suffix, or by identifying the file type
next to the link in parentheses, e.g., "link (PDF)".
</p>

<p>As a courtesy to your users, consider also including a link to the
Acrobat Reader download site. As of this writing, the<a name="INDEX-398" /> URL<a name="INDEX-399" /> <a name="INDEX-400" /> is <a href="../../../../../../www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html</a>.
