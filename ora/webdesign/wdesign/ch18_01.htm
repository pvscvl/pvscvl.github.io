<a name="INDEX-2196" /> <a name="INDEX-2197" />In layperson's
terms, Server Side Includes (SSI) are special placeholders in an HTML
document that the server replaces with actual data just before
sending the final document to the browser. By the time the document
gets to the browser, it looks just like any other HTML page (even if
someone happens to "view source"), as though you typed
the data into the HTML source by hand.
</p>

<p>When the server looks through the file for placeholders (SSI
commands), it is said to <em class="citetitle">parse</em> the file. The
server then inserts the requested data, which could be anything from
the current date and time to other HTML documents to the results of a
CGI script. (The complete list of information available via Server
Side Includes is listed later in this chapter.)

<h2 class="sect1">18.1. How SSI Is Used</h2>

<p>SSI allows you to create the framework for pages that will be
dynamically generated by the server. For the web author, this can be
a powerful tool for managing site production and increasing
efficiency. The following are just a few examples of the ways SSI can
be used:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Placing elements that you use over and over again. If you have an
element that appears on every page of your site, such as a complex
navigational header, you can use a single SSI command that just
sources it in instead. If you make changes to the header, such as
changing a URL or a graphic, you need to make the change only once,
and it will be updated automatically on all pages of your site.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Placing a constantly changing element on your page with a single
line. For example, if you maintain a home page that has a message
that changes every day, you can use a Server Side Include command
(and a script on the server) to replace the message automatically.
You never need to touch the source code for the home page -- you
just let the server do the work.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Show the date and time the page was last updated, or show the current
date and time in the user's time zone.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Allow multiple users to submit content for inclusion on a web page
without giving them access to the HTML source. For example, staff
members could send in weekly updates via email. The server could run
a script that turns the email into a text file, which is then
inserted into the web page via an SSI command.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Serve an appropriate web page based on the browser making the
request. You can even serve documents based on the user's
domain name. (Note that not all servers can perform conditional
functions. This is discussed later in this chapter.)
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Obviously, these are just a handful of possibilities, but they
demonstrate the sort of tasks well suited for Server Side Includes.

<h3 class="sect2">18.1.1. Advantages</h3>

<p>Server Side Includes offer the following advantages:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>It's easy to learn the basic SSI syntax and start implementing
simple SSI.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Most servers provide support for SSI or can add it quickly (check
with your server administrator first).
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Pages can be dynamically generated, including up-to-the-second
information and content served based on information about the
users' viewing environment.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>It isn't browser-dependent like JavaScript, so it works for
everyone (as long as it works on your server).
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The commands don't display in the browser, so your methods are
invisible to the user.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>It's less work for the server than processing CGI programs for
the same functions.
</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 class="sect2">18.1.2. Disadvantages</h3>

<p>There are few disadvantages:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Parsing a file and adding information requires slightly more work for
the server than serving a straight HTML document.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enabling Server Side Includes on the server may pose a security risk.
Talk to your server administrator to find out the policy for SSI on
your server.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>SSI is not as robust a solution for dynamic page generation as other
scripting methods such as ASP or PHP.
</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 class="sect2">18.1.3. Getting the Most Out of SSI</h3>

<p>The examples in this chapter illustrate the basic form and function
of SSI commands. On their own, Server Side Includes provide some
useful, though limited, tools for dynamic page generation. The real
power of Server Side Includes comes in the combination of SSI
commands with CGI scripts running on the server. The CGI programs do
the necessary processing before the information is ready to be placed
in the HTML page.
</p>

<p>If you focus on front-end web design, you can get started right away
using the elements and variables listed in this chapter, but you may
need to consult a CGI programmer to design the back-end for more
advanced SSI solutions.
