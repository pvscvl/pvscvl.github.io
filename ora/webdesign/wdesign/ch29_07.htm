<h2 class="sect1">29.7. DHTML Tools</h2>

<p>Many <a name="INDEX-2946" />web designers
rely on WYSIWYG tools and editors for creating web pages. These tools
make it possible to see the effects of creating and editing
immediately. There are a number of DHTML WYSIWYG editors available
today that may suit your needs for creating dynamic web pages.
</p>

<p>Even with the relatively simple examples we've examined in this
chapter, you can see that hand coding DHTML can be complicated and
arduous. In addition, the differences between Navigator 4.0 and
Internet Explorer 4.0 force web designers to write two additional
sets of code for each function, to retain backwards-compatibility.
This increases production time and creates code that is difficult to
read and maintain.
</p>

<p>There are many tools that create DHTML for you behind the scenes.
Some of these tools are narrow in focus and provide specific
functionality, while others, such as Macromedia Dreamweaver and Adobe
GoLive, are full packages with which you can create and maintain
whole web sites, as well as write DHTML code.
</p>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this book to provide working details of
WYSIWIG DHTML tools. Each of these tools has their own pros and cons.
Commercial tools with full DHTML support are likely to provide a more
robust implementation and better support to users. However, these
software packages require a larger investment of time and money. If
you want only simple animations or style changes, a shareware tool
may be the best way for you to go. Luckily, most web authoring tools
are available for free download over the Internet on a trial basis,
so you can experiment and choose the one that suits your needs. To
learn about available tools, check out the resources listed at the
end of this chapter.
</p>

<p>WYSIWYG DHTML tools differ greatly in their operation. They have to
allow you to view and manipulate layers, styles, scripts, and
animation in a graphical way. You can create animations by dragging
objects in the editor, thus eliminating the need to write JavaScript
that counts pixels and tracks x,y coordinates. Dreamweaver, for
instance, features built-in behaviors for rollovers, moving layers,
and changing styles. You can also download extensions from
Macromedia's web site, most of them created by third-party
developers; these add a variety of DHTML behaviors and commands to
Dreamweaver.

<h3 class="sect2">29.7.1. Advantages</h3>

<p>Consider these advantages to using WYSIWYG DHTML tools:</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">There is a shorter learning curve for WYSIWYG
editors.</b><a name="INDEX-2947" /> Because DHTML is a combination of HTML,
JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets, and DOM, it has a steep learning
curve. An editor hides the complexities of DHTML and allows you to
manipulate objects through a timeline or other graphic interface.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Editors allow you to create effects more
quickly.</b> An effect that could take hours of coding and
then debugging may be created on a WYSIWYG editor in a matter of
minutes.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Cross-browser implementation is less of a
worry.</b> Browser compatibility is less of an issue with
DHTML editors. Most of them create cross-browser DHTML, and most will
also tell you which behaviors will work with which browsers.
</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 class="sect2">29.7.2. Disadvantages</h3>

<p>There are also some disadvantages, however:</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">WYSIWYG editors are expensive.</b> Some
of these editors can cost hundreds of dollars, which isn't
within every developer's budget. Editors can vary greatly in
price, so shop around. Luckily, most software companies allow you to
try their editor for free so that you can make an educated decision
before buying.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Editors may not give precise control over your
objects.</b> Not every editor gives you pixel level control
over your dynamic objects and pages. Many designs require precise,
pixel-level control of dynamic objects. Also, you are viewing your
code as your editor chooses to depict it -- if bugs do occur in
your DHTML pages, they may be more difficult to fix.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">An editor may not do everything.</b> By
using a WYSIWYG editor, you are removing yourself from your DHTML
code by one degree. If you are dependent upon your editor for DHTML
effects, new DHTML features cannot be taken advantage of until the
company that creates your editor publishes a version that exploits
those advancements for you. Most likely they'll charge for the
upgrade. Meanwhile, other designers who can write their own DHTML
code are able to exploit advancements as soon as they are supported
in web browsers.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Tools may write unnaturally complex
code.</b> Tools may make some processes more complex than they
need to be, for instance, creating custom objects when they're
not<a name="INDEX-2948" />
necessary.
