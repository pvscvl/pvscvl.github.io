<h2 class="sect1">30.5. Examples of XML Technology</h2>

<p>With XML's ability to allow customized tagging systems,
it's not surprising that it is finding a wide variety of uses.
It has already made a big impact on the Internet since its formal
introduction in 1998. This section takes a look at just a few of the
ways XML is being put to work.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">30.5.1. Standard XML Languages</h3>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium monitors standard XML
<em class="firstterm">applications</em><a name="INDEX-2971" /> (languages written according to the rules
of XML) that have an impact on how media is presented over the Web,
thus changing the Web's capabilities. In fact, virtually all
new web-related technologies and languages developed by the W3C
follow the rules of XML. This section looks at the more prominent
developments.

<h3 class="sect3">30.5.1.1. Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL)</h3>

<p>SMIL (pronounced "smile") is an XML language for
combining audio, video, text, and graphics in a precise, synchronized
fashion. It is discussed more thoroughly in <a href="ch27_01.htm">Chapter 27, "Introduction to SMIL"</a>.

<h3 class="sect3">30.5.1.2. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2972" />
<a name="INDEX-2973" />XML
has typically been used to define the structure of text elements
within a document; however, many groups are working on ways in which
it could be used to define graphical information as well. The W3C is
developing the Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) standard. According to
the W3C:
</p>


<p>SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics in XML. SVG
allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes
(e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves), images and
text. Graphical objects can be grouped, styled, transformed and
composited into previously rendered objects. Text can be in any XML
namespace suitable to the application, which enhances searchability
and accessibility of the SVG graphics. The feature set includes
nested transformations, clipping paths, alpha masks, filter effects,
template objects and extensibility.
</p>


<p>The following sample SVG code (taken from the W3C Recommendation)
creates an SVG document fragment that contains a red circle with a
blue outline (stroke):
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 20001102//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20001102/DTD/svg-20001102.dtd"&gt;
&lt;svg width="12cm" height="4cm"&gt;
&lt;desc&gt;Example circle01 - circle expressed in physical units&lt;/desc&gt;

&lt;circle cx="6cm" cy="2cm" r="1cm"
        style="fill:red; stroke:blue; stroke-width:0.1cm" /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The SVG standard provides ways to describe paths, fills, a variety of
shapes, special filters, text, and basic animation.
</p>

<p>Adobe offers tools for both creating and viewing SVG files. The
drawing program Illustrator 9 can now export
<em class="filename">.svg</em> files directly. Adobe's SVG Viewer is
a browser plug-in available for Navigator and Internet Explorer 4 and
higher for Windows and Macintosh that allows SVG files to display in
the browser window.
</p>

<h3 class="sect3">30.5.1.3. Mathematical Markup Language (MathML)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2974" />MathML is an XML application for
describing mathematical notation and capturing both its structure and
content. The goal of MathML is to enable mathematics to be served,
received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has
enabled this functionality for text. MathML became a formal W3C
Recommendation in February 2001.
</p>

<p>Because there is no way to reproduce mathematical equations directly
using HTML, authors have resorted to inserting graphical images of
equations into the flow of text. This effectively removes the
information from the structure of the document. MathML allows the
information to remain in the document in a meaningful way. With
adequate style sheets, mathematical notation can be formatted for
high-quality visual presentation. Several vendors offer applets and
plug-ins that allow the display of MathML information in browser
windows.

<h3 class="sect3">30.5.1.4. Resource Description Framework (RDF)</h3>

<p>RDF is an XML application used to define the structure of metadata
for documents (i.e., data that is useful for indexing, navigating,
and searching a site). A formal method for describing the contents of
a web site, page, or resource could be useful to automated agents
that search the Web for specific information. Metadata could be used
in the following ways:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>For resource discovery to provide better search engine capabilities</p>
</li><li>
<p>In cataloging for describing the content and content relationships
available at a particular web site, page, or digital library
</p>
</li><li>
<p>By intelligent software agents to facilitate knowledge sharing and
exchange
</p>
</li><li>
<p>In content rating</p>
</li><li>
<p>In describing collections of pages that represent a single logical
"document"
</p>
</li><li>
<p>For digital signatures that allow electronic commerce, collaboration,
and other "trust"-based applications
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>RDF is in the very early stages of development as of this writing. To
follow its progress, see <a href="../../../../../../www.w3.org/RDF/">http://www.w3.org/RDF/</a>.

<h3 class="sect2">30.5.2. Other XML Applications</h3>

<p>Some XML technologies serve a specific community, as the Chemical
Markup Language serves the scientific community, but these
technologies are often of limited interest to most publishers. Others
are so specific that they serve only a particular intranet of a
single business.
</p>

<p>XML is poised to become a major player on the Internet. Companies are
excited by the technology and have invested large amounts of time and
money in its development.
</p>

<p>The following are just a few of the ways XML is being implemented
today.
