<h2 class="sect1">12.3. The &lt;img&gt; Tag and Its Attributes</h2>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1152" /> <a name="INDEX-1153" /><tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag
inserts a graphic image into the document's text flow. Placing
graphics inline with the text does not introduce any line breaks or
extra space. By default, the bottom of an image aligns with the
baseline of surrounding text (ways to alter this are discussed
later).
</p>

<p>There are over a dozen attributes that can be added within the
<tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag to affect its display, but the
only required attribute is
<tt class="literal">src</tt><a name="INDEX-1154" />, which
provides the URL of the graphic. The HTML 4.01 specification has
declared the <tt class="literal">alt</tt> attribute (for alternative text,
see explanation below) to be required as well, but the graphic will
display just fine without it. The minimal HTML tag for placing an
image on the page looks like this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;IMG SRC="url of graphic"&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p><a href="ch12_03.htm">Figure 12-1</a> shows an inline image and its HTML
source.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-12-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="84" alt="Figure 12-1" src="figs/WDN2_1201.gif" width="342" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 12-1. A graphic placed within a line of text</h4>

<p>The URL of the graphic can be absolute (including the protocol and
domain name) or relative to the current document (using a relative
pathname). The conventions for relative pathnames are described in
detail in <a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "A Beginner's Guide to the Server"</a>.

<h3 class="sect2">12.3.1. Linked Graphics</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1155" />
<a name="INDEX-1156" />To
make a graphic a link, place anchor tags around the image tag just as
you would around any string of text characters:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;A HREF="document.html"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="picture.gif"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>When a graphic is linked, the browser displays a two-pixel-wide
border around the image in the same color as the text links on the
page (bright blue by default). In most cases, this blue border is
unacceptable, particularly around a graphic with transparent edges,
but it is quite simple to turn it off using the
<tt class="literal">border</tt> attribute.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">border</tt><a name="INDEX-1157" /> attribute
specifies the width of the border in number of pixels. Specifying a
value of zero turns the borders off, as shown in the following
example. Of course, if you are fond of the blue borders, you could
just as easily make them really wide by setting a higher number
value.
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;A HREF="document.html"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="picture.gif" BORDER="0"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<h3 class="sect2">12.3.2. Alternative Text</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1158" />
<a name="INDEX-1159" /> <a name="INDEX-1160" />If a graphic cannot be displayed (either
because the file is corrupted or cannot be found), the browser
displays a generic broken graphic icon in its place. The browser will
also display a generic graphic icon when the user has chosen to turn
graphics off for faster browsing (and a lot of users do). The
<tt class="literal">alt</tt> attribute allows you to specify a string of
alternative text to be displayed in place of the graphic when the
graphic is unavailable, as shown in <a href="ch12_03.htm">Figure 12-2</a>. It
is also what non-graphical browsers display in place of images.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-12-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img height="77" alt="Figure 12-2" src="figs/WDN2_1202.gif" width="432" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 12-2. Alternative text is displayed when graphics are unavailable</h4>

<p>When alternative text is provided in the image tag, users at least
know what they're missing. This is particularly important when
graphics are links that make up the main navigation of the site.
Readers can follow a link if they know where it goes, even if the
graphic isn't visible. Without the alternative text, the page
would be a big dead end.
</p>

<p>Internet Explorer 4.0+ and Netscape 6 display alternative text as a
pop-up "tool tip" when the mouse rests on the image area.
</p>

<p>Taking the extra time to provide alternative text for your images is
the simplest way to make your page accessible to the greatest number
of readers. In fact, the HTML 4.01 specification has declared
<tt class="literal">alt</tt> to be a required attribute within the
<tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag (although browsers are not
currently enforcing this).
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">12.3.3. Specifying Width and Height</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1161" /> <a name="INDEX-1162" />Although <tt class="literal">src</tt> is the
only truly necessary attribute in the <tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt>
tag, a few others come strongly recommended. The first is
<tt class="literal">alt</tt>, discussed in the previous section.
<tt class="literal">width</tt> and
<tt class="literal">height</tt><a name="INDEX-1163" />
<a name="INDEX-1164" /> are the
others. The <tt class="literal">width</tt> and <tt class="literal">height</tt>
attributes simply indicate the dimension of the graphic in pixels,
such as:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;IMG SRC="star.gif" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="50"&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>With this information, the browser can lay out the page before the
graphics download. Without width and height values, the page may be
redrawn several times (first without graphics in place, and again
each time new graphics arrive). It is worthwhile to take the time to
include accurate width and height information in the image tag.

<h3 class="sect3">12.3.3.1. Resizing images</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1165" /> <a name="INDEX-1166" />If the values
specified in the <tt class="literal">width</tt> and
<tt class="literal">height</tt> attributes are different than the actual
dimensions of the graphic, the browser resizes the graphic to match
the specified dimensions. If you specify a percentage value for width
and height, some later browsers resize the image to the desired
proportions.
</p>

<p>Although this effect can certainly be used strategically, as for
resizing a single pixel graphic to hold a certain amount of space, it
usually just results in a pixelated, poor image quality, as shown in
<a href="ch12_03.htm">Figure 12-3</a>. It is better to resize images in a
graphics program than to leave it up to the browser.

<p><a name="INDEX-1167" />
<a name="INDEX-1168" />
<a name="INDEX-1169" />Preloading images refers to methods used
for downloading images and storing them in cache before they actually
need to be displayed on the page. One trick for preloading is to
place the graphic on a page that will be accessed first (such as a
home page), but with the width and height attributes set to one
pixel. This causes the image to download with the rest of the page,
but the only thing that will be visible is a one-pixel dot (which can
be tucked away in a inconspicuous place).
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;IMG SRC="bigpicture.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Ideally, the image finishes downloading quietly and is stored in the
browser's cache while the user is still reading the first page.
The graphic should then pop into view instantly when the user links
to the page where the image is displayed at its full size.

<h3 class="sect2">12.3.4. Vertical Alignment</h3>

<p>The
<tt class="literal">align</tt><a name="INDEX-1170" />
<a name="INDEX-1171" />
<a name="INDEX-1172" />
<a name="INDEX-1173" /> attribute is used
to control how the graphic is positioned in relation to the flow of
the text.
</p>

<p>Vertical alignment controls the placement of the graphic in relation
to points in the surrounding text (usually the baseline). The default
alignment is <tt class="literal">bottom</tt><a name="INDEX-1174" />, which aligns the bottom of the
image with the baseline of the surrounding text. <a href="ch12_03.htm">Figure 12-4</a> shows the result for the following code with
no vertical alignment settings:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;P&gt;Star light &lt;IMG SRC="star.gif"&gt; Star bright.&lt;/P&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="INDEX-1175" /> <a name="INDEX-1176" />The universally supported values for
vertical alignment are <tt class="literal">top</tt>, <tt class="literal">middle
</tt>, and <tt class="literal">bottom </tt>. Netscape Navigator
introduced another (somewhat more subtle) set, which was then picked
up for support in Internet Explorer 4.0. These are
<tt class="literal">absbottom</tt>, <tt class="literal">absmiddle</tt>,
<tt class="literal">texttop</tt>, and <tt class="literal">baseline</tt> (the same
as <tt class="literal">bottom
</tt>).<a name="INDEX-1177" /> <a name="INDEX-1178" /> <a name="INDEX-1179" />
</p>

<p><a href="ch12_03.htm">Figure 12-5</a> demonstrates the intended effects of
each of these alignment values. The reality is slightly different.
The <tt class="literal">absbottom</tt> value, for instance, seems to render
the same as <tt class="literal">bottom</tt> , even in Navigator.

<p>The <tt class="literal">align</tt> attribute can be used to align a graphic

<tt class="literal">left</tt><a name="INDEX-1180" />
<a name="INDEX-1181" /> or <tt class="literal">right</tt>,
respectively. What makes the left and right alignment special is that
in addition to placing the graphic on a margin, it allows the text to
flow around it.

then align the paragraph to the right, as shown here:

<p><a name="INDEX-1182" />
<a name="INDEX-1183" />

<a name="INDEX-1185" />When text
flows around a graphic, it tends to bump up against the
graphic's edge. Usually, it is preferable to have a little
space between the graphic and the surrounding text. In HTML, this
space is provided by using the <tt class="literal">vspace</tt> and
<tt class="literal">hspace</tt> attributes within the
<tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">vspace</tt> (vertical space) attribute holds a
specified number of pixels space above and below an aligned graphic.
Space to the left and the right is added with
<tt class="literal">hspace</tt> (horizontal space). Note that space is
always added symmetrically (both top and bottom, or on both sides),
and it is not possible with these attributes to specify an amount of
space along a particular side of the graphic (you can, however, do
this with style sheets). <a href="ch12_03.htm">Figure 12-7</a> shows an image
aligned with the <tt class="literal">hspace</tt> attribute set to 12.

<p><a name="INDEX-1186" />
<a name="INDEX-1187" />
<a name="INDEX-1188" />Text automatically wraps to fill the space
along the side of an aligned graphic (or other inline object). To
stop the text from wrapping and start the next line against the
margin (instead of against the image), insert a line break tag
(<tt class="literal">&lt;br&gt;</tt>) with the
<tt class="literal">clear</tt><a name="INDEX-1189" /> attribute.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">clear</tt> attribute gives the browser directions
on where to place the new line. It has three possible values:
<tt class="literal">left</tt><a name="INDEX-1190" />
<a name="INDEX-1191" /> <a name="INDEX-1192" />, <tt class="literal">right</tt>,
and <tt class="literal">all</tt>. If your graphic is aligned right, insert
<tt class="literal">&lt;br</tt> <tt class="literal">clear=right&gt;</tt> to begin
the text below the graphic against the right margin. For left-aligned
graphics, use <tt class="literal">&lt;br</tt>
<tt class="literal">clear=left&gt;</tt>. The <tt class="literal">&lt;br</tt>
<tt class="literal">clear=all&gt;</tt> tag starts the text below the

<a name="INDEX-1196" />
<a name="INDEX-1197" />
<a name="INDEX-1198" />Remember
that when designing for the Web, you must always consider the time it
takes to download files. Images are particularly bandwidth-hungry, so
you should use them with care. One successful strategy for providing
access to very large images (with correspondingly large file sizes)
is to provide a postage-stamp-sized preview graphic that links to the
full-size graphic.
</p>

<p>The preview could be a reduction of the whole image or just an
alluring fragment. Be sure to provide information necessary to help
users decide whether they want to spend the time clicking the link,
such as a description of what they're going to get and the file
size of the image (so they can make an estimate of how long
they'll need to wait).
</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-12-SECT-3.6.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.3.6.2. Reuse images whenever possible</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1199" />
<a name="INDEX-1200" />
<a name="INDEX-1201" />When a browser downloads a graphic, it
stores it in the disk cache (a space for temporarily storing files on
the hard disk). That way, if it needs to redisplay the page, it can
just pull up a local copy of the HTML and graphics files without
making a new trip out to the remote server.
</p>

<p>When you use the same graphic repetitively in a page or a site, the
browser only needs to download the graphic once. Every subsequent
instance of the graphic is grabbed from the local cache, which means
less traffic for the server and faster display for the end user.
</p>

<p>The browser recognizes a graphic by its entire pathname, not just the
file name, so if you want to take advantage of file caching, be sure
that each instance of your graphic is pointing to the same graphic on
the server (not multiple copies of the same graphic in different
directories).

<h3 class="sect3">12.3.6.3. The lowsrc trick</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1202" />
<a name="INDEX-1203" />Large
graphics may take a long time to download via slow connection speeds,
which means your viewers may spend moments staring at an empty space
on the screen. The <tt class="literal">lowsrc</tt> attribute for the
<tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag (introduced by Netscape) provides
one way to quickly give users some indication of the image to come
while the "real" graphic is still downloading.
</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">lowsrc</tt> attribute provides the URL for an image
file that the browser loads and displays when it first encounters the
<tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag. Then, once the document has
completely loaded, the browser goes back and retrieves the image
specified by the <tt class="literal">src</tt> attribute, as shown in <a href="ch12_03.htm">Figure 12-9</a>.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-12-FIG-9" /><div class="figure"><img height="105" alt="Figure 12-9" src="figs/WDN2_1209.gif" width="431" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 12-9. Code and images for using the lowsrc trick</h4>

<p>To use this the way it was intended, the <tt class="literal">lowsrc</tt>
image should contain the same image as the final graphic, but in a
format that compresses to a much smaller file size. For instance, an
image made up of only black and white pixels could stand in for a
full-color JPEG.
</p>

<p>With improving bandwidth speeds, this technique has grown a bit
antiquated. When a page loads quickly, the initial image may appear
as a brief flash or not be visible at all. The
<tt class="literal">lowsrc</tt> attribute is not recognized in the HTML
4.01 specification and is supported only by Netscape
Navigator.<a name="INDEX-1204" /> <a name="INDEX-1205" />
