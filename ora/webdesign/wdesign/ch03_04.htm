<h2 class="sect1">3.4. Graphics on the Web</h2>

<p>Print<a name="INDEX-238" />
designers need to adapt their graphics production skills for the Web
to take into account the peculiarities of graphics that are
distributed over a network and displayed on computer monitors.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.4.1. Graphics File Formats</h3>

<p>As <a name="INDEX-239" />of this writing, nearly all the
graphics that you see on the Web are in one of two formats: GIF and
JPEG. A third worthy contender, the PNG file, is struggling for
browser support and attention. What follows is a very brief
introduction to each of these online graphic formats. More detailed
descriptions are provided in the chapters dedicated to each format.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-4.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.4.1.1. The ubiquitous GIF</h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-240" /> <a name="INDEX-241" />GIF (Graphic
Interchange Format) file format is the traditional darling of the
Web. It was the first file format to be supported by web browsers,
and it continues to be the format for the vast majority of graphics
on the Web today.
</p>

<p>GIFs are indexed color files with a maximum 8-bit palette capacity,
which means that a GIF can contain a maximum of 256 pixel colors.
Because they compress color information by rows of pixels, GIF files
are most appropriate for graphics that contain areas of flat color.
</p>

<p>See<em class="citetitle"> </em><a href="ch19_01.htm">Chapter 19, "GIF Format"</a><em class="citetitle">
</em>for complete information on the GIF file format.
</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-4.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.4.1.2. The handy JPEG</h3>

<p>The second most popular graphics format on the Web today is the
<a name="INDEX-242" /> <a name="INDEX-243" />JPEG ( Joint
Photographic Experts Group) format. JPEGs contain 24-bit color
information -- that's millions of colors, as opposed to
GIF's 256. They use what is called a "lossy"
compression scheme, which means that some image information is thrown
out in the compression process, but in most cases, the degradation of
the image is not detrimental or even noticeable.
</p>

<p>Photographic images, or any image with subtle gradations of color,
are best saved as JPEG files because they offer better image quality
packed into a smaller file. JPEGs, however, are not a good solution
for flat, graphical images, because they tend to mottle colors, and
the resulting file will generally be a lot larger than the same image
saved as a GIF.
</p>

<p>See <a href="ch20_01.htm">Chapter 20, "JPEG Format"</a><em class="citetitle"> </em>for complete
information on the JPEG file format.

<h3 class="sect3">3.4.1.3. The lurking PNG</h3>

<p>There is a third graphic format vying for usage on the
Web -- <a name="INDEX-244" />PNG (Portable Network Graphic), which,
despite some very attractive features, has been slow to catch on.
</p>

<p>PNGs can support 8-bit indexed color, 16-bit grayscale, or 24-bit
true color images with a "lossless" compression scheme,
which means higher image quality and, in some cases, file sizes even
smaller than their GIF counterparts. Not only that, but PNG files
also have some nifty features such as built-in gamma control and
variable transparency levels (which means you can have a background
pattern show through a soft drop-shadow).

file format

<h3 class="sect2">3.4.2. Image Resolution</h3>

<p>Simply<a name="INDEX-245" />
<a name="INDEX-246" /> put, all graphics on the Web need to be
low-<a name="INDEX-247" />resolution:
72ppi (pixels per inch). Since web graphics are always displayed on
low-resolution computer screens, higher resolution files are
unnecessary.
</p>

<p>Working at such a low resolution can be quite an adjustment for a
designer accustomed to handling the 300dpi images appropriate for
print. Most notably, the image quality is lower because there is not
as much image information in a given space. This tends to make the
image look more grainy or pixelated, and unfortunately, that's
just the nature of images on the Web.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SIDEBAR-2" /><blockquote><table cellpadding=3 border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Measuring Resolution</h4>

<p>Because web graphics exist solely on the screen, it is technically
correct to measure their resolution in <a name="INDEX-248" />
<a name="INDEX-249" />pixels per inch (ppi). Another
resolution measurement, <a name="INDEX-250" />dpi (dots per inch), refers
to the resolution of a printed image, dependent on the resolution of
the printing device.
</p>

<p>In practice, the terms dpi and ppi are used interchangeably. It is
generally accepted practice to refer to web graphic resolution in
terms of dpi.

<h3 class="sect3">3.4.2.1. Image size</h3>

<p>When<a name="INDEX-251" />
a<a name="INDEX-252" />
graphic is displayed on a web page, the pixels in the image map
one-to-one with the display resolution of the monitor. When the
resolution is higher, the pixel size is smaller. Therefore, a graphic
that appears to be about one inch square on your 72ppi monitor may
actually appear to be quite a bit smaller on a monitor with a
resolution closer to 100. (See <a href="ch03_04.htm">Figure 3-3</a>.)
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-FIG-3" /><div class="figure"><img height="263" alt="Figure 3-3" src="figs/WDN2_0303.gif" width="430" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 3-3. The size of an image is dependent on monitor resolution</h4>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-4.2.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.4.2.2. Good-bye inches, hello pixels</h3>

<p>Because the actual dimensions of a graphic are dependent on the
resolution of the monitor, the whole notion of
"<a name="INDEX-253" />inches" becomes irrelevant in the
web environment. The only meaningful unit of measurement is the
pixel.
</p>

<p>It is general practice to create images at 72ppi (it puts you in the
ballpark for screen presentation), but to pay attention only to the
overall pixel dimensions. You can disregard inches entirely in the
web graphics production process. After a while, thinking in pixels
comes quite naturally. What's important is the size of the
graphic relevant to other graphics on that page and to the overall
size of the browser window.
</p>

<p>For instance, some users still have monitors with resolutions of 640
<img src="figs/U00D7.gif"> 480 pixels. To guarantee that my banner graphic fits in the
screen in its entirety, I would make it no more than 600 pixels wide
(taking into account that some pixels will be used on the left and
right for the window and the scrollbar). The size of the remaining
buttons and images on my page are measured in pixels relative to my
600-pixel-wide banner. For more information on designing for standard
monitor resolutions, see <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "Designing for a Variety of Displays"</a><em class="citetitle">.</em>

<h3 class="sect2">3.4.3. Be Aware of File Size</h3>

<p>It goes<a name="INDEX-254" />
without saying that graphics have made the Web what it is today;
however, as a web designer, you should know that many users have a
love/hate relationship with graphics on the Web. Remember that
graphics increase the time it takes a web page to move across the
network; large graphics mean substantial download times, which can
try the user's patience, particularly a user dialing in on a
standard modem connection.
</p>

<p>Here is the single most important guideline a web designer can
follow: <em class="emphasis">Keep the file sizes of your graphics as small as
possible!</em> The nature of publishing over a network creates
a new responsibility for designers to be sensitive to the issue of
download times. Fortunately, new web graphics tools, such as
Macromedia Fireworks and Adobe Photoshop 5.5 and higher (including
ImageReady), make it easy to make adjustments to the image while
keeping an eye on the resulting file size.
</p>

<p>Detailed strategies for minimizing graphic file size for each file
format appear in the graphics chapters in <a href="part3.htm">Part III, "Graphics"</a> of this book.

<h3 class="sect2">3.4.4. Web Graphics Production Tips</h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-255" />following is a collection of tips for
maintaining quality in web graphics.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-4.4.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.4.4.1. Work in RGB mode</h3>

<p>When<a name="INDEX-256" /> you are
creating graphics for the Web, it is important to work in the RGB
color mode. <a name="INDEX-257" />CMYK
mode, while common to the print world, is incorrect for web graphics.
When creating a <a name="INDEX-258" />GIF file, do your designing and editing
in RGB mode and convert it to Indexed Color as the final step before
saving. It's a good idea to hang onto an RGB original for later
changes. To make this process easier, web graphics tools such as
Photoshop 5.5 and higher, ImageReady, and Fireworks have separate
export functions that create the final graphics while retaining the
RGB original. <a name="INDEX-259" />JPEG graphics should simply be saved in
RGB mode.
</p>

<p>If you need to make adjustments to an existing GIF, you should
convert it back to RGB mode before editing. When an image is in
indexed color mode, the colors are restricted to those in its defined
Color Table, and no new colors can be added. This prevents the color
blends and adjustments that occur when image elements are transformed
(resized, rotated, etc.) or when adding anti-aliased text. When the
image is in indexed color mode, any text you add will automatically
have aliased (stair-stepped) edges. (If you only need to crop the GIF
or make other changes that don't require the addition of new
pixel colors, it is okay to work directly in indexed color mode.)
</p>

<p>The typical steps that should be taken when editing an existing GIF
are:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Open the GIF in the image editing tool.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Change it to RGB color mode (in Photoshop, select Image <img alt="Figure 3.4.4.1" src="figs/U2192.gif" /> Mode
<img alt="Figure 3.4.4.1" src="figs/U2192.gif" /> RGB Color).
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Edit the image as necessary.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Change it back to indexed color mode, setting the desired palette and
bit-depth.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Save or export to GIF format.</p>
</li></ol>

<h3 class="sect3">3.4.4.2. Resizing tips</h3>

<p>The following tips pertain to resizing web
<a name="INDEX-260" />graphics:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Convert to RGB before resizing.</b> As
mentioned earlier, in order to resize an image,
<a name="INDEX-261" />Photoshop (or any bitmap image
editing tool) needs to create new transitions between areas of color
in the image. Indexed color images (such as GIFs) are limited to the
colors in the image's color table, which does not give
Photoshop enough colors to create convincing "in-between"
colors for these transitions.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Don't resize larger.</b> As a
general rule, it is a bad idea to increase the dimensions of a
low-resolution image (such as 72ppi images typically used on the
Web). Image editing tools cannot add image information to the
file -- they can only stretch out what's already there. This
results in a pixelated and blotchy image.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Resize smaller in increments.</b> Images
can be made slightly smaller without much degradation in image
quality; however, drastic resizing (making a snapshot-sized image
postage-stamp size) usually results in an unacceptably blurry image.
When acquiring an image (whether by scanning or from a CD-ROM), it is
best to choose an image that is slightly larger than final size. That
way, you don't need to make it larger, and you won't have
to scale it down too much. If you must make a very large image very
small, try doing it in a number of steps, fixing quality at each
stage.
</p>

<p>Be sure to keep a clean copy of the original image in case you make
something too small. Starting over is better than enlarging the image
or resizing repeatedly.

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-4.4.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.4.4.3. Use anti-aliased text</h3>

<p>In general, to create professional-looking graphics
for<a name="INDEX-262" />
the Web, you should use anti-aliased text.
<em class="firstterm">Anti-aliasing</em><a name="INDEX-263" />
is the slight blur used on curved edges to make smoother transitions
between colors. Aliased edges, by contrast, are blocky and
stair-stepped. <a href="ch03_04.htm">Figure 3-4</a> shows the effect of
aliasing (left) and anti-aliasing (right).
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-FIG-4" /><div class="figure"><img height="168" alt="Figure 3-4" src="figs/WDN2_0304.gif" width="318" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 3-4. Aliased and anti-aliased edges</h4>

<p>The exception to this guideline is very small text (10 to 12 points
or smaller, depending on the font design), for which anti-aliased
edges blur the characters to the point of illegibility. Text at small
sizes may fare much better when anti-aliasing is turned off or set to
"None."
</p>

<p>The trade-off for better-looking graphics is file
size -- anti-aliasing adds to the number of colors in the image
and may result in a slightly larger file size. In this case, the
improved quality is usually worth a couple<a name="INDEX-264" /> of extra bytes.
