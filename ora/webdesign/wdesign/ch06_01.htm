<a name="INDEX-408" />Responsible
web design includes making pages accessible even to users with
disabilities, such as hearing, sight, cognitive, or motor skills
impairments. Millions of people have disabilities that affect their
access to information on the Web.
</p>

<p>Many disabled users take advantage of assistive technologies for web
browsing, both for input and output. For instance, some people have
disabilities that make it impossible to input information using a
standard keyboard or mouse. Instead, they may use a speech input
device or a simple pointer attached to a headset. Others have
disabilities that hinder the way they get information from a page.
Vision impaired users may use a text browser (such as Lynx) in
conjunction with software that reads the contents of the screen
aloud. Some use devices that translate the text into Braille for
tactile reading.
</p>

<p>For most sites, accessibility is proper web design etiquette; for
government web sites, it is the law. Section 508 (effective June 25,
2001) mandates that all Federal agencies' electronic and
information technology be accessible to people with disabilities. For
more information, see <a href="../../../../../../www.section508.gov/">http://www.section508.gov</a>. 
</p>

<p>By promoting accessibility for those with disabilities, content
becomes more available to all users, regardless of the device they
use to access the Web. This includes any alternative to the standard
desktop graphical browser, such as palmtop computers or automobile
dashboard browsing systems. Even users who have graphics turned off
in their browsers to speed up download times will benefit from basic
accessibility measures.

<div class="sect1"><a name="wdnut2-CHP-6-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">6.1. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</h2>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-409" />World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has
launched its <a name="INDEX-410" /> <a name="INDEX-411" />Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI),
which aims to make the Web universally accessible. The WAI ensures
that web technologies such as HTML and CSS support accessibility and
promotes education and research to see that the standards are
understood and followed.
</p>

<p>In addition to overseeing the development of web technologies, the
WAI has created recommendation documents that address three key
audiences. First, the <em class="citetitle">Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines</em> recommendation provides rules and techniques
for web designers and authors on how to create content that is as
accessible as possible. This chapter focuses primarily on these
efforts. The <em class="citetitle">Authoring Tool Accessibility
Guidelines</em> speaks to software developers making web
authoring tools. Tools should make it easy to create
standards-compliant content, as well as being accessible themselves.
And third, the <em class="citetitle">User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines</em> are for developers of browsing devices, from
standard desktop graphical browsers to specialized assistive
technologies.
</p>

<p>These documents, as well as useful news, tools, and resources, are
available at the WAI site (<a href="../../../../../../www.w3.org/WAI/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/</a>).
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-6-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.1.1. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h3>

<p>In general, to make web <a name="INDEX-412" />content accessible to
everyone, there is a greater reliance on text and document structure.
That is not to say that sites need to be text-only and media-free in
order to be accessible to everyone. The goal is to create sites that
(as the WAI puts it) "transform gracefully" when accessed
via alternative methods. Some simple examples include providing
alternative text for images that can be read if the image can't
be viewed, or providing a text transcript of an audio track if it
can't be heard. It also requires the proper use of HTML markup
for document structure and Cascading Style Sheets for presentation.
</p>

<p>The <em class="citetitle">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</em>
document is a recommendation by the WAI for web designers and web
content developers. It outlines the general principles of accessible
design in the form of 14 guidelines. Each guideline is supported by a
number of "checkpoints" that describe how the guideline
applies. In addition, each point is given a priority rating:
<em class="citetitle">Priority 1</em> means the guideline must be
followed in all cases, <em class="citetitle">Priority 2</em> items should
be addressed in order to make the material more accessible, and
<em class="citetitle">Priority 3</em> means that the point may be
addressed for the most thorough compliance with standards.
</p>

</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-6-SECT-1.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.1.2. The Guidelines</h3>

<p><em class="citetitle">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</em> is a
thorough and highly detailed document. What follows here is a summary
of the guidelines to point you in the right direction. For the
details, read the original document online at <a href="../../../../../../www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</a>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 1: Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>When providing text alternatives to images, video, and audio, be sure
that the text has the same function and purpose as the media it is
replacing. For example, if there is a graphic of an arrow that is
used as a link to the top of the page, the alternative text should
read "go to the top of the page," not
"arrow." In addition, consider providing an auditory
track (like a narrative explanation) for video media whose meaning is
lost if it can't be seen.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 2: Don't rely on color alone.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Make sure your site is usable in black and white and colors contrast
sufficiently.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 3: Use markup and style sheets and do so properly.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Great strides have been made in HTML and CSS technology to aid in
accessibility, but they are only successful if they are used
consistently to separate style from content.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 4: Clarify natural language usage.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Identify the language of the document and mark up exceptions such as
foreign words, abbreviations, and acronyms. This makes it easier for
speech devices and other assistive technologies to interpret the
content.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 5: Create tables that transform gracefully.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The WAI recommends that tables be used for tabular data only. In
addition, taking advantage of the more descriptive HTML 4 table
markup can help users with disabilities navigate through complex
tables. It is also useful to provide a summary of the table's
contents in the <tt class="literal">&lt;table&gt;</tt> tag.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 6: Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Make sure that your page still works and makes sense without style
sheets, JavaScript, applets, or other objects added to the page.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 7: Ensure user control of time-sensitive changes.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Any scrolling, blinking, or otherwise moving object should be able to
be paused or stopped. Audio should be able to be paused or turned off
as well.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 8: Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This means that if you create your own site interface using a Java
applet or Flash, the interface should follow basic accessibility
guidelines.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 9: Design for device-independence.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Keep in mind that users may be using a variety of input devices, such
as a mouse, keyboard, voice, head wand, or other device. Take
advantage of technologies that allow shortcuts to links and elements
on the page.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 10: Use interim solutions.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The W3C is developing technologies that will be useful just while
older browsers are catching up to the current HTML 4.0/CSS2 way of
doing things. These interim solutions ensure that older browsers
operate correctly.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 11: Use W3C technologies and guidelines.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This one seems like a given, but be sure to use the current
technologies since they have been developed and reviewed thoughtfully
to support accessibility.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 12: Provide context and orientation information.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Provide clear labels for frames, sections of the page, and any
complex page structure that requires extra explanation. Keep in mind
what it would be like to use your site if you couldn't see it.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 13: Provide clear navigation mechanisms.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Take measures to ensure your site is easy to navigate, including
clearly identified links, a site map or index, and consistent
navigation.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Guideline 14: Ensure documents are clear and simple.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Everyone benefits from web pages that are laid out clearly and
use<a name="INDEX-413" />
<a name="INDEX-414" /> simple
language.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h3 class="sect2">6.1.3. The Techniques</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-415" /> <a name="INDEX-416" />WAI<a name="INDEX-417" /> has also compiled a list of very
practical applications of each of these principles in a document
called <em class="citetitle">Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
1.0</em>. It provides specific techniques that address each of
the checkpoints outlined in the general guidelines document. It also
acts as a gateway to a number of other resources that describe the
specifics on how HTML, CSS, and other core technologies address
accessibility.
</p>

<p>The WAI Techniques document is too vast to summarize here, but the
following list presents a few simple measures you can take to make
your pages more accessible:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Avoid using images for text and information.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Provide alternative text for all images (via the
<tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag's
<tt class="literal">alt</tt><a name="INDEX-418" />
<a name="INDEX-419" /> <a name="INDEX-420" /> or <tt class="literal">longdesc</tt> attribute).
Make the alternative text rich and meaningful. Adding
<tt class="literal">alt</tt> text should be standard procedure for all web
page creation; in fact, in the new HTML 4.0 specification, the
<tt class="literal">alt</tt> attribute is now a
<em class="emphasis">required</em> part of the <tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag.
(See <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Structural HTML Tags"</a><em class="citetitle"> </em>for more
information.)
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Add <a name="INDEX-421" />
<a name="INDEX-422" />periods at the end of
<tt class="literal">alt</tt> text so a speech device can locate the logical
end of the phrase.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>When linking a graphic, provide a caption under it that also serves
as a text link.<a name="INDEX-423" />
<a name="INDEX-424" />
<a name="INDEX-425" />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Always provide text link alternatives for
<a name="INDEX-426" />
<a name="INDEX-427" /> <a name="INDEX-428" />
<a name="INDEX-429" /> <a name="INDEX-430" />
<a name="INDEX-431" />imagemaps.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Offer a text-only version of the whole site from the home page.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Provide transcripts or descriptions of
<a name="INDEX-432" />
<a name="INDEX-433" />
<a name="INDEX-434" />
<a name="INDEX-435" />audio clips to make
that content accessible to those with hearing impairments.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Provide alternative mechanisms for online
<a name="INDEX-436" />forms, such as a text-based order form
or a phone number for personal assistance.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Avoid the
<tt class="literal">&lt;blink&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-437" /> <a name="INDEX-438" />
<a name="INDEX-439" />
<a name="INDEX-440" /> tag, which is
said to wreak havoc with Braille and speech displays.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><a name="INDEX-441" />
<a name="INDEX-442" />Be aware that misuse of HTML structural
tags for presentation purposes (such as using the
<tt class="literal">&lt;blockquote&gt;</tt> tag purely to achieve indents)
hinders clear communication via a speech or Braille device.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Avoid using pop-up windows as they can be disorienting to
sight-impaired users.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you would like to check how accessible your web page is, try
running it through a validator, such as <a name="INDEX-443" />Bobby (<a href="../../../../../../www.cast.org/bobby/">http://www.cast.org/bobby/</a>), that will scan
your page and point out accessibility issues.
