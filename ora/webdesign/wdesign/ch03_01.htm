<p>If<a name="INDEX-152" /> you are accustomed to designing for
print, the Web introduces a number of new concepts and new ways of
doing things. Part of what makes web design unique is that the pages
are displayed on a computer monitor, not paper, requiring familiarity
with new color models. In addition, you need to work within the
unique environment of the web browser. The HTML markup language
brings its own limitations to the mix.
</p>

<p>This chapter discusses some basic web design concepts, which may be
new for print designers or for anyone who is just getting started in
web design. It provides necessary background information about the
web environment, including how browsers deal with color, graphics,
and typography, so that you can make design decisions that are
appropriate to the medium.

<h2 class="sect1">3.1. The Web Is Not Like Print</h2>

<p>Designing pages for the Web is fundamentally different from designing
a printed page. The single most difficult challenge in making the
transition from print to web design is that on the Web, you cannot
control absolutely the way your page looks to the end user. The way
the page displays is a function of the browser it is viewed on and
the user's preference settings, as shown in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Figure 3-1</a>. By its nature, the Web forces designers to
give up control over the very things designers are traditionally
responsible for controlling, such as page size, alignment, fonts, and
colors. The experience is a shock until you get used to it. Becoming
a good web designer requires a solid understanding of the web
environment in order to anticipate and plan for these shifting
variables.

<h3 class="sect2">3.1.1. Designing for the Unknown</h3>

<p>When you design a web page, you are creating a page that will be
viewed under a vast range of unknown conditions. There are a number
of factors that will directly impact the design and functionality of
a web page.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Unknown browsers</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>As<a name="INDEX-153" />
discussed in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "Designing for a Variety of Browsers"</a>, there are hundreds of
browser versions in use today. The same page source may look and
function differently depending on the browser rendering it.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Unknown platform</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The user's operating system also impacts how a web page looks
and functions. Some technologies are better supported on Windows than
on a Macintosh or Unix system. The platform also affects basic
display elements, such as fonts, colors, and form elements.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Unknown user preferences</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Every browser is built with the opportunity for users to set the
default appearance of the pages they view. The user's settings
will override yours, and there's not much you can do about it.
Not only can users adjust the fonts and colors, but they may also opt
to turn off basic functionality, such as image display, JavaScript,
and Java support.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Unknown window size</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>In<a name="INDEX-154" /> print, one of the first things
you establish about a project is its trim size (the size of the
printed page). On the Web, there is no way to know the size of the
"page" since browser windows can fill a variety of
monitor resolutions or be resized to any random dimension. This is
discussed in <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "Designing for a Variety of Displays"</a>.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Unknown connection speed</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Most likely, the people viewing your pages access the Internet at a
wide range of speeds: from high speed T1, cable, and DSL connections
all the way down to pokey 28.8-kilobaud modems. Unless you are
designing specifically for broadband applications, assume the worst
when it comes to connection speeds. The golden rule of web design is
to keep your files as small as possible. On the Web, graphics should
measure just a few kilobytes (K). For commercial sites, pages with
files totalling more than 50K or 60K are considered bloated (although
it seems miniscule compared to file sizes typically used in desktop
publishing for print).
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Unknown colors</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>When<a name="INDEX-155" /> you are publishing materials that will be
viewed on computer monitors, you need to deal with the varying ways
computers and browsers handle color. This is discussed later in this
chapter.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Unknown fonts</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>It may come<a name="INDEX-156" /> <a name="INDEX-157" /> as a shock to learn that you cannot
really specify fonts on web pages. The way text appears is a result
of browser settings, platform, and user preferences. Typography on
the Web is discussed later in this chapter.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>To sum it up bluntly, there's no way to know exactly how your
page will look or function for the end user. This is a tough pill to
swallow for most print designers.

<h3 class="sect2">3.1.2. Surviving the Unknown</h3>

<p>The best advice for conquering this new medium is to <em class="emphasis">let
go</em> of some of the control you are accustomed to having
over the page. Elements shift around, text resizes, and pages look
different to different people. That's the way it works.
Don't expect to design a page in Quark and have it reproduced
precisely in a web browser or you're bucking the medium. Good
web design is judged by a different set of criteria. On the Web,
what's important is how a page works and that it is accessible
to everyone. As a web designer, you will learn to design structures
and impose a set of rules rather than fuss with absolute alignment.
After a while, you will develop a feel for designing around the
"unknowns" on the Web.

design and the new responsibilities it places on designers, read

Veen (New Riders, 2001). And for a thoughtful essay on how to work
with the medium, not against it, see "The Dao of Web
Design" by John Allsopp, published on A List Apart (<a href="../../../../../../www.alistapart.com/stories/dao/dao_1.html">http://www.alistapart.com/stories/dao/dao_1.html</a>).
