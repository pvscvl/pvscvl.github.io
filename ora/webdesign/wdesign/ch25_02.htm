<h2 class="sect1">25.2. Compression</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-2666" />
<a name="INDEX-2667" />
<a name="INDEX-2668" />Digital video
wouldn't be possible without methods for compressing the vast
amounts of data necessary to describe sound and frame images. Video
files can be compressed in a number of ways. This section looks at a
variety of compression schemes and introduces the methods they use
for achieving compression rates. Understanding your options can help
you make better decisions for optimizing your video files.

<h3 class="sect2">25.2.1. Lossless Versus Lossy Compression</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2669" />
<a name="INDEX-2670" /> <a name="INDEX-2671" />
<a name="INDEX-2672" />
<a name="INDEX-2673" />
<a name="INDEX-2674" />Compression can be
"lossless," which means no information is lost and the
final file is identical to the original.
</p>

<p>Most compression schemes use forms of <em class="firstterm">lossy
compression</em>. Lossy compression sacrifices some data from
the file to achieve much higher compression rates. Lossy compression
schemes, such as MPEG, use complicated algorithms that toss out data
for sound and image detail that is not discernible to the human ear
or eye. The decompressed file is extremely similar in character to
the original, yet is not identical. This is similar to the way JPEG
handles still images.

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-25-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">25.2.2. Spatial Versus Temporal Compression</h3>

<p><em class="firstterm">Spatial </em><a name="INDEX-2675" />
<a name="INDEX-2676" />(or
<em class="firstterm">intraframe</em>) compression takes place on each
individual frame of the video, compressing the pixel information as
though it were a still image.
</p>

<p><em class="firstterm"> Temporal</em> (or
<em class="firstterm">interframe</em>)<em class="firstterm"> </em>compression
happens over a series of frames and takes advantage of areas of the
image that remain unchanged from frame to frame, throwing out data
for repeated pixels.
</p>

<p>Temporal compression relies on the placement of <em class="firstterm">key
frames</em><a name="INDEX-2677" /> interspersed throughout the frames
sequence. The key frames are used as masters against which the
following frames (called delta frames) are compared. It is
recommended that a key frame be placed once every second; therefore,
if you have a frame rate of 15 fps, set your key frame rate once
every 15 frames.
</p>

<p>Videos without a lot of motion, such as talking head clips, take the
best advantage of temporal compression. Videos with pans and other
motion are compressed less efficiently.

<h3 class="sect2">25.2.3. Video Codecs</h3>

<p>There are a number of
<em class="firstterm">codecs</em><a name="INDEX-2678" /> (compression/decompression algorithms)
that can be used to compress video files for the Web. Many of these
codecs can be applied to several different file formats (discussed in
the next section of this chapter).
</p>

<p>Video-editing software packages often offer a long list of codecs in
their compressor list options. Here we focus on just those that are
relevant to video intended for web delivery.
</p>

<a name="INDEX-2679" />
<a name="INDEX-2680" />
<dl>
<dt><b>Radius Cinepak</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Cinepak provides decent compression/decompression rates and is
compatible with both QuickTime or AVI formats. It employs both
spatial and temporal compression and a lossy compression scheme at
lower quality levels. Low to medium quality settings will produce
acceptable quality video. It is also well supported, so if you want
your video to be viewable by the widest possible audience, choose
Cinepak.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Sorenson</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2681" /> <a name="INDEX-2682" />
<a name="INDEX-2683" />The Sorenson
Video codec was designed for low-bandwidth applications and is
capable of producing files with lower data rates (if you select the
Limit Data Rate option) than Cinepak while maintaining excellent
quality. It is the ideal codec for web delivery, with some
concessions. First, because it uses complicated compression
algorithms, it requires a lot of processing power and may not run
smoothly on older machines. It also requires that users install
QuickTime Version 3 or higher. While growing in popularity, it will
be a while before it is completely risk-free.

</dl>


<a name="INDEX-2684" />
<a name="INDEX-2685" />
<dl>
<dt><b>Intel Indeo</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The Indeo codec provides compression rates similar to Cinepak by the
use of spatial and temporal compression, with lossy compression at
low quality levels. Its drawbacks are that it does not maintain
quality at data rates as low as Cinepak, and it requires high-end
machines to perform at its best.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<a name="INDEX-2686" />
<dl>
<dt><b>Animation</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>If your video clip is all computer-generated graphical imagery (i.e.,
not sourced from videotape), you may want to try the Animation
compressor. Depending on the type of image, the Cinepak codec may
work just as well (or better) for these types of files.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>MPEG</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-2687" />MPEG codec can only be used when
the final video file will be in MPEG format (it is not compatible
with other file types). It uses a lossy compression scheme (although
it may be lossless at high-quality settings) and spatial and temporal
compression. MPEG offers the best compression possible, but MPEGs are
not yet as widely supported on the Web as other video formats.
