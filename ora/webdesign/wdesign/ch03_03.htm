<h2 class="sect1">3.3. Color on the Web</h2>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-197" />Web
requires designers to think about color in new ways. In part, it
means understanding color in a more technical manner -- the
appearance of a page can benefit greatly if a designer knows
what's going on "under the hood." The peculiarities
of working with color in web design are functions of the following
simple principles:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Monitors</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Web pages are displayed on computer monitors, therefore they follow
the basic rules of how computers and monitors handle color.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<a name="INDEX-198" />
<dl>
<dt><b>Browsers</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Because browsers have built-in resources for rendering color when
running on systems with limited color display capacity, they can
alter the appearance of the colors in your pages.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<a name="INDEX-199" />
<a name="INDEX-200" />
<dl>
<dt><b>HTML</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Colors on a web page that are not part of a graphic (for example,
background and text colors) need to be properly identified in the
HTML tags of the document. This topic is covered in more detail in
<a href="ch16_01.htm">Chapter 16, "Specifying Color in HTML"</a>.

<h3 class="sect2">3.3.1. Color on Computer Monitors</h3>

<p>Color on <a name="INDEX-201" />monitors is made of light,
so traditional systems for specifying color for print (CMYK, Pantone
swatches, etc.) do not apply. Monitors differ in the number of colors
they can display at a time. On the high end, 24-bit monitors are
capable of displaying nearly 17 million colors. 16-bit monitors can
display over 65 thousand colors. On the low end, 8-bit monitors are
able to display only 256 colors at a time.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-3.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.3.1.1. RGB color</h3>

<p>Computer monitors display colors by combining red, green, and blue
light. This color system is known as RGB color.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-202" />RGB color is a 24-bit system, with eight
bits of data devoted to each of three color channels. Eight bits of
data can describe 256 colors. With 256 possible colors in each of the
three channels, the total possible number of colors is calculated by
multiplying 256 <img src="figs/U00D7.gif"> 256 &times; 256 for a total of 16,777,216.
That's more than enough colors to provide stunning
representations of artwork and photography. 24-bit color is often
referred to as the <em class="firstterm">true color
space</em><a name="INDEX-203" />.
</p>

<p>Although all colors on computer monitors are made up of combinations
of red, green, and blue light, there are actually a number of
numerical systems for identifying colors, including RGB (red, green,
and blue values), <a name="INDEX-204" />Lab (lightness, a channel, and b
channel), and <a name="INDEX-205" />HSB (hue, saturation, brightness).
</p>

<p>For purposes of web design, colors are referred to by their numerical
RGB values, on a scale from 0 to 255. For instance, the RGB values
for a particular dark orange color are R:198, G:83, B:52.
</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-3.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.3.1.2. Palettes</h3>

<p>Colors from the true color space can be approximated reasonably well
on 16-bit monitors (see <a href="ch03_03.htm">the sidebar "Color Issues on 16-Bit Displays"</a> later in this chapter). 8-bit monitors make use of a
<em class="firstterm">color palette</em>, a set 256 colors, to determine
which colors to display at any one time.
</p>

<p>For system-level operations, computers use a specific set of 256
colors called the <em class="firstterm">system
palette</em><a name="INDEX-206" />. Macs and PCs use slightly different
sets of 256 colors in their system palettes. But specific
applications may use their own palettes; for instance, browsers have
a built-in palette, known as the <em class="firstterm">web
palette</em><a name="INDEX-207" />, which gets called into use only when
the browser is used on an 8-bit monitor.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-3.1.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.3.1.3. Gamma</h3>

<p><em class="firstterm">Gamma</em><a name="INDEX-208" />
refers to the overall brightness of a computer monitor's
display. In more technical terms, it is a numerical adjustment for
the nonlinear relationship of voltage to light intensity -- but
feel free to think of it as brightness. The default gamma setting
varies from platform to platform. Images and pages created on a
Macintosh generally look a lot darker when viewed on a Windows or
Unix/Linux system. Images created on Windows machine generally look
washed out when seen on a Mac. The higher the gamma value, the darker
the display. <a href="ch03_03.htm">Table 3-3</a> shows the standard gamma
settings for the major platforms.

<p>Because the vast majority of users are viewing the Web from the
Windows environment, gamma differences are of particular concern to
developers who are designing pages and graphics on a Macintosh.
However, if you are designing under Windows and anticipate a large
percentage of Mac traffic to your site (such as a site for graphic
designers), be sure to test your pages under Macintosh gamma
conditions.
</p>

<p>Several popular web graphics tools come with utilities for simulating
or adjusting gamma levels:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Adobe Photoshop Gamma Control Panel</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">For the

<dt><b>Adobe ImageReady Gamma Simulator</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-211" />ImageReady (bundled with Photoshop

alternate operating system. It also allows you to adjust the gamma
value (brightness) of the image to make the image look acceptable for
both platforms.
</p>

<p>To preview the image, choose View <img alt="Figure 3.3.1.3" src="figs/U2192.gif" /> Windows Gamma/Mac Gamma. The
image brightness will adjust to simulate the gamma setting of the
specified platform. Choosing it again restores the image to its
previous gamma value.
</p>

<p>To automatically adjust the gamma in ImageReady:</p>


<ol><li>

Windows-to-Macintosh to adjust for Mac displays.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click OK.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>You can also apply a manual gamma adjustment by moving the Gamma

<h3 class="sect2">3.3.2. Color in Browsers ( The Web Palette)</h3>

<p>An <a name="INDEX-214" />
<a name="INDEX-215" />interesting problem arises when
colors from the full 24-bit color space need to be displayed on an
8-bit display. Rather than relying on the computer's system
palette, browsers reduce and remap colors to their own built-in
palette. This is a benefit to web designers because it guarantees
that images will look more or less the same on all 8-bit systems. If
images were mapped to the various system palettes, they would look
quite different on different platforms. (Note that if the browser is
running on a 24-bit display, the palette does not come into effect
and all colors will be displayed accurately.)
</p>

<p>This <em class="firstterm">web palette</em> consists of the 216 colors
shared by the Macintosh and Windows system palettes; therefore,
colors chosen from the web palette render accurately on Mac or
Windows displays. The web palette was optimized for Macs and Windows;
<a name="INDEX-216" />Unix machines use a different color model
for their system palette, so "web-safe" colors may shift
or dither when viewed on Unix systems.
</p>

<p>The web palette is also known as the Netscape Palette, Netscape 216,
Browser-Safe Palette, Web-Safe Palette,
<a name="INDEX-217" />Non-dithering Palette, and the 6
<img src="figs/U00D7.gif"> 6 &times; 6 cube. The web palette is displayed at <a href="../../../../../../www.learningwebdesign.com/webpalette.html">http://www.learningwebdesign.com/webpalette.html</a>.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-3.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.3.2.1. Shifting and dithering</h3>

<p>When a browser running on an 8-bit monitor encounters a color, it
does its best to approximate it using colors from the web palette.
This can happen in two ways:
<em class="firstterm">shifting</em><a name="INDEX-218" /> and
<em class="firstterm">dithering</em><a name="INDEX-219" />.
</p>

<p>Sometimes colors are simply replaced by, or
<em class="firstterm">shift</em> to, the nearest available web palette
color. This is common in colors specified in the HTML document, such
as background or table colors, although colors can shift in images as
well. Color shifting can result in large discrepancies between how a
color (as defined by its RGB values) is rendered on a 24-bit display
versus an 8-bit display.
</p>

<p>Browsers may also approximate a color by
<em class="firstterm">dithering</em>, mixing
<a name="INDEX-220" />pixels
of similar colors available in the palette, resulting in a random dot
pattern. This is common in images, although Internet Explorer may
dither background colors as well. For photographic images, the
effects of dithering usually are not detrimental (and in some cases
may be beneficial). However, in areas of flat color (such as in a
logo or line-art illustration), the speckle pattern is usually
undesirable.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SIDEBAR-1" /><blockquote><table cellpadding=3 border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Color Issues on 16-Bit Displays</h4>

<p>As of this writing, approximately half of all users view the Web on
16-bit monitors capable of displaying over 65,000 colors. While this
is plenty of colors, they are unfortunately not the same colors found
in the 24-bit true color space. This means that the RGB colors you
specify in HTML or select in a graphics program (even
"web-safe" colors) are always approximated on 16-bit
displays, resulting in subtle shifting or dithering.
</p>

<p>This effect is most noticeable when trying to match a graphic exactly
to a background tile or color specified in HTML. Despite the fact
that the foreground and background elements may have numerically
identical RGB values, the "seam" may still be slightly
visible on 16-bit displays. The only way to prevent this mismatch is
to make the edges of the graphic transparent instead of a solid
color, allowing the background color to show through.
</p>

<p>For an in-depth yet understandable explanation of how 16-bit displays
handle color at the mathematical level, I highly recommend reading
"Death of the Websafe Color Palette?" by David Lehn and
Hadley Stern on Webmonkey (<a href="../../../../../../hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/00/37/index2a.html">http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/00/37/index2a.html</a>).

<h3 class="sect3">3.3.2.2. The web palette in numbers</h3>

<p>An important <a name="INDEX-221" />way to look at the
web palette is by its numerical values. The web palette recognizes
six shades of red, six shades of green, and six shades of blue,
resulting in 216 possible color values (6 <img src="figs/U00D7.gif"> 6 &times; 6 = 216).
This is sometimes referred to as the 6 <img src="figs/U00D7.gif"> 6 &times; 6 color

<p>There are three systems used for defining <a name="INDEX-222" />
<a name="INDEX-223" />RGB values. Which one you use
depends on the requirements of your software:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Decimal</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-224" />Most image editing software
displays the RGB value of a color in decimal values, ranging from 0
to 255. A color's decimal RGB value might be 51-51-255, meaning
the red value is 51, the green value is 51, and the blue value is
255. Note that these numbers specify one of 256 possible values for
each channel; they are not percentage values. Web-safe colors are
multiples of 51.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Hexadecimal</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-225" />HTML and many programming
languages require that RGB numbers be specified in the hexadecimal
numbering system. Hexadecimal is a base-16 system that requires only
six characters to describe an RGB color. The hexadecimal equivalent
of 51-51-255 is 3333FF. See <a href="ch14_01.htm">Chapter 14, "Frames"</a> for more a
thorough explanation.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Percentage</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-226" /> <a name="INDEX-227" />A
few older programs for the Macintosh use the Apple Color Picker to
specify colors in percentages, not absolute RGB decimal values.
Web-safe color values are in increments of 20%. The percentage value
equivalent of 51-51-255 is 20%-20%-100%.

<h3 class="sect2">3.3.3. Designing with the Web Palette </h3>

<p>While<a name="INDEX-230" /> the web palette can lead to
unpredictable and undesirable effects such as dithering or color
shifting on 8-bit monitors, you can also use it to your advantage.
Because you know <em class="emphasis">exactly</em> which colors will
render accurately on Macs and Windows machines, you can use these
colors exclusively when designing your graphics and HTML pages. It
requires a little extra effort and means sacrificing color selection,
but the advantage is that you'll be able to predict what the
pages will look like for all users. Using web-safe colors in graphics
production is discussed in <a href="ch22_01.htm">Chapter 22, "Designing Graphics with the Web Palette"</a>.
</p>

<p>If you choose to add color to the background and text on your web
pages, chances are you'll need to do some experimenting with
color to get the combinations just right. There are a number of tools
and options for selecting web-safe colors and incorporating them into
your designs.

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-3-SECT-3.3.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.3.3.1. Web authoring tools</h3>

<p>Many <a name="INDEX-231" />WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You

Adobe GoLive, and Microsoft FrontPage), allow you to choose from
swatches of web-safe colors when applying color to text and
backgrounds. You can see the results of your choices immediately in
the application window or when you preview in a browser. These tools
automatically generate all the necessary HTML code for you.

<p>If <a name="INDEX-232" />

<p>If an<a name="INDEX-237" /> 8-bit display allows 256 colors, and there
are 216 colors in the browser's web palette, you may be
wondering what happens to the other 40 colors. Normally, the browser
allows colors from the user's system palette to fill in the
extra 40 color slots. These extra colors can go a long way in
smoothing out colors that can't be recreated accurately using
web palette colors alone. This is particularly true for grayscale
images, which are difficult to reproduce using only the four web-safe
gray tones in the web palette.
</p>

<p>There is a bug in Navigator 4.0 on the Macintosh that prevents system
colors from seeping in, resulting in inferior image quality on 8-bit
monitors. But chances are this problem affects few users, so
it's nothing to worry about.
