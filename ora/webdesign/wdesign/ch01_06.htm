<h2 class="sect1">1.6. The Importance of Standards</h2>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-52" />Internet was built on standards. When a
need for functionality was identified (email attachments, for
example) a person or group proposed a system to make it work. After a
discussion phase, the proposal was made public in the form of a
<a name="INDEX-53" />
<a name="INDEX-54" />Request for Comments (RFC). The RFC
process is overseen by the <a name="INDEX-55" /> <a name="INDEX-56" />Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF), an international community of network
designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the
evolution of the Internet (see <a href="../../../../../../www.ietf.org/">http://www.ietf.org</a> for more information).
Once the kinks were worked out, other developers adopted the method
and a standard was born.
</p>

<p>The Web, with its early explosion of excitement and opportunism,
skipped over this traditional standards process. Although the
<a name="INDEX-57" /> <a name="INDEX-58" />World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), a group of industry experts and professionals who
guide the evolution of the Web) began working on HTML standards in
1994, the browser software companies didn't wait for them.
</p>

<p>Once Netscape Navigator popped up on the scene with its set of
proprietary tags, they set in motion the process by which we've
inherited the browser chaos outlined in this chapter. The problem
only got worse as web design grew beyond simple HTML to encompass
richer web technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and DHTML. Not
only does developing for a multitude of incompatible browsers cause
headaches, but redundant development time also costs a lot of money.
</p>

<p>It didn't take long for the development community to say,
"Enough is enough!" and demand that the browser creators
slow down and abide by the web standards set forth by the W3C. The
champion of this effort is the <a name="INDEX-59" /> <a name="INDEX-60" />Web Standards Project (WaSP).
WaSP is a collective of web developers who are pushing hard for
action.
</p>

<p>Their first goal, of course, is to get all browsers to support the
same standards for HTML and other web technologies. In an ideal
world, there would be one way to code a page for a particular effect,
and it would work exactly the same way on 100% of the browsers,
regardless of platform. Although Netscape 6 and Internet Explorer 5
(Mac) and Internet Explorer 5.5 (Windows) boast standards compliance,
there are still a few bugs to work out. It will also take some years
for older browser versions to fade away. But the current trend is
encouraging.
</p>

<p>WaSP also works hard to educate web developers on the need to observe
standards. The end goal is total observance of standards, which means
that web content and style information should be kept separate: the
content in a structured HTML or XML document, and the instructions
for how it is displayed contained in a style sheet. This becomes
especially pertinent as we see more alternative browsing clients
(such as wireless handheld devices with tiny screens) hitting the
scenes. As long as web designers continue to use
<tt class="literal">&lt;font&gt;</tt> and other hacks to the HTML concept,
the standards effort is diluted and web content is not fully
accessible.
</p>

<p>The third community WaSP takes on is the developers of web authoring
tools. Currently, the code generated by<a name="INDEX-61" /> WYSIWYG authoring tools is far
from standard (note the abundance of <tt class="literal">&lt;font&gt;</tt>
tags and cheats for creating indents). It is essential that the
available tools make it simple for developers to create web pages
properly -- using standard HTML for structure and style sheets for
presentation.
</p>

<p>Every web designer should be well versed in the importance of
standards. For a thorough (albeit strongly opinionated) introduction,
