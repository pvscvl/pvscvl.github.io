<h2 class="sect1">5.2. Printer-Friendly HTML Pages</h2>

<p>One <a name="INDEX-359" />way to ensure that your users can get a
good copy of your content to-go is to link to a separate
"printer-friendly" HTML document especially for printing.
In general, printer-friendly pages are stripped-down versions
containing just a single column of content with minimum HTML
formatting. <a href="ch05_02.htm">Figure 5-1</a> shows pages from two web
developer resource sites and their corresponding printed pages.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-5-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="411" alt="Figure 5-1" src="figs/WDN2_0501.gif" width="435" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-1. Two web pages and their corresponding printer-friendly versions</h4>

<p>The following sections detail some steps you can take to design
printer-friendly pages. Of course, if you anticipate that your
audience will want to do a lot of printing from your site, you may
choose to design your original pages according to the same
printer-friendly guidelines.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-5-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.1. Keep the Page Narrow</h3>

<p>The most common problem with printing web pages is that the right
edge can get cropped off. This happens when the page is fixed at a
pixel width (using a table) or contains graphics such as a navigation
bar that is wider than the printable area of the page.
</p>

<p>So how wide is too wide? If you want to be absolutely sure that no
content slips off the edge for anyone, keep the width of tables and
graphics under 550 pixels. An even more conservative approach is to
use HTML text only (with no tables fixing the page width) and only
minimal graphics.
</p>

<p>Browsers that shrink the page to fit the printable area can
accommodate any page width, but you risk the contents becoming too
tiny to be legible, so it's best to keep tables and images
under 750 pixels wide.
</p>

</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-5-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.2. Keep Text Visible</h3>

<p>Another tip for keeping web pages fit to print is to use black (or
dark) text on a white (or light) background. Some older browsers are
known to print out dark backgrounds and the text black as well (even
though it is white on the screen), resulting in a solid field of
black on the paper.
</p>

<p>While browsers are now more capable of printing colors as they are
seen on the screen, in general, your printer-friendly version should
be designed to look like a printed document, with dark type on a
light background. It saves on toner as well!
</p>

<p>While many home users print to color inkjet printers, people in
offices are more likely to be printing on black-and-white laser
printers. For this reason, printer-friendly pages shouldn't
rely on color output for communication.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-5-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.3. Think About Content</h3>

<p>If <a name="INDEX-360" />you are
taking the time to create a separate printer-friendly document, you
should tailor the content of that document to be appropriate to the
medium. Consider why the user is printing out the web page and how it
is going to be used. Chances are, people just want the content of the
page for later reading or filing. Following are some things to
consider when assembling your page:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>If your readers are interested in content (such as an article), you
can strip out anything extra on the page, including navigation,
search boxes, etc. Whether you include ads may be more of a marketing
mandate than a design decision, but in general, they should be left
out too.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The print document should have some way of identifying where it came
from for future reference, including the site name and subsection
labels when appropriate. It doesn't hurt to write out the URL
if it is not clear, in case users don't have headers and
footers turned on in their printouts.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>If your article is divided across several web pages, combine it into
one printable document.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>On a printed page, hypertext links are useless, of course. Where the
original article contains linked text, consider writing the complete
URL for the link in parentheses after the linked word. That way, a
reader can type in the URL to follow the link later.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>If your content pages are generated dynamically from a database,
create a template specifically for printer-friendly versions. This
prevents needing to make two HTML files for every page<a name="INDEX-361" />.
</p>
</li></ul>
