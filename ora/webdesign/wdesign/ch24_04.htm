<h2 class="sect1">24.4. Streaming Audio</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-2617" />Once
upon a time, the only way to play audio from a web page was to link
to it and wait for it to download to the hard drive so it could be
played. With this method, once the file finishes downloading, the
browser either launches an external player or uses a plug-in to play
the audio.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-15">[15]</a>
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-15" /><p>[15]Some common Macintosh external players
include QuickTime and iTunes. <a name="INDEX-2618" /> <a name="INDEX-2619" />MediaPlayer is a common player on the
Windows operating system. Internet Explorer Versions 3 and higher can
play many audio file formats natively. Netscape Navigator 3.0 and 4.0
uses the <a name="INDEX-2620" />LiveAudio plug-in to play most audio
files. The <a name="INDEX-2621" /> <a name="INDEX-2622" />QuickTime player is available for both
platforms and as a plug-in to both browsers.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Downloaded audio has a few distinct disadvantages. First, because the
file needs to download to the hard disk in its entirety before it can
begin playing, users may be faced with a very long wait before they
hear any sound. In addition, because the audio file is copied to the
hard drive, it is more difficult for artists and publishers to limit
distribution and protect copyrights.
</p>

<p>Although it is still possible and common to deliver static audio
files in this manner, it is far more effective to use one of several
streaming media technologies. Streaming media (be it audio or video)
begins playing almost immediately after the request is made, and
continues playing as the audio data is being transferred. Streaming
audio technology was developed to address the problem of unacceptable
download times. It can even be used to broadcast live programs, such
as concerts or baseball games.
</p>

<p>The following are some advantages to streaming audio:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>	Audio begins playing soon after the stream begins.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using new technologies and formats, sound quality doesn't need
to be as severely sacrificed.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Artists and publishers can better control distribution and protect
copyright because the user never gets a copy of the audio file.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Consider also these disadvantages:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>	The potentially high cost of server software may be prohibitive.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Some formats require a dedicated or preconfigured server, which may
be problematic with some hosting services.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sound quality and stream may be adversely affected by low speed or
inconsistent Internet connections.

<h3 class="sect2">24.4.1. Streaming File Formats</h3>

<p>It used to be that if you wanted audio to stream, you had to use
RealAudio technology. Not so anymore. As it became obvious that
streaming was the best way to deliver sound to the Web, we've
seen the development of a number of compteting proprietary
technologies, as well as solutions for streaming standard file
formats such as MP3 and QuickTime. The following formats have
streaming functionality:
</p>

<blockquote class="simplelist">

<p>RealNetwork's RealMedia (and RealAudio)</p>

<p>Apple's QuickTime</p>

<p>Microsoft's Windows Media (Netshow)</p>

<p>Streaming MP3s (using a streaming MP3 server like SHOUTcast)</p>

<p>Macromedia Flash and Shockwave</p>

<p>Liquid Audio</p>

<p>Beatnik's Rich Music Format (RMF)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These file formats are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">24.4.2. Server Software and Protocols</h3>

<p>True streaming relies on special server software that permits the
uninterrupted flow of data. The information in the song is broken up
into little "packets" and sent out in order over the
lines. These packets are then reassembled on the user's end.
The audio player collects a number of packets before playback begins
(a process called <em class="firstterm">buffering</em>) to increase the
likelihood of smooth playback.
</p>

<p>Streaming media takes advantage of either UDP (User Datagram
Protocol), RTSP (RealTime Streaming Protocol), or RTP (RealTime
Transfer Protocol) for the transmission of data. What makes these
protocols effective at streaming is that if a packet of information
is dropped or missing, the data transmission continues on without it.
This is in contrast to traditional HTTP, the traditional protocol of
the Web, which stops and tries to resend lost packets, potentially
halting the stream.
</p>

<p>UDP was the first protocol used for streaming media because of its
improvements over HTTP. The newer RTSP is more efficent than UDP.
RTSP is a two-way streaming protocol, allowing the user to send
messages back to the server (such as rewinding the tape). By
contrast, RTP (used by Apple QuickTime) is a one-way stream (similar
to HTTP in this regard), only the file never downloads completely to
the user's hard drive as it does in HTTP or FTP transfers.
</p>

<p>Commercial streaming server software, such as RealServer, can handle
thousands of simultaneous streams. It provides robust administrative
tools and offers advanced functions such as bandwidth negotiation
(where the proper bit rate version is delivered based on the
connection speed). The software and hardware to set up a dedicated
streaming server can be quite costly. On top of that, RealNetworks
charges licensing fees based on number of streams.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">24.4.3. Pseudo-Streaming</h3>

<p>Some media formats are designed to begin playing before they've
completely downloaded, producing a streaming effect even when the
files are served from an HTTP server. This is known as
pseudo-streaming or HTTP-streaming.
</p>

<p>The advantage to pseudo-streaming is that it requires no special (and
costly!) server software. You just put the files on your server as
you would a GIF or JPEG. This is a good solution for broadcasting
relatively short audio tracks to just a few simultaneous listeners.
</p>

<p>There are a number of key limitations to serving streaming media from
a web server. It can not handle heavy server loads and multiple
simultaneous connections. You also sacrifice the advanced
administration tools and bandwidth negotiation (users have to choose
the appropriate file for themselves). This method also makes it
impossible to do live broadcasts since the whole file needs to be
available for download.
</p>

<p>With the proper player on the user's end, RealMedia, QuickTime,
MP3, Flash, and Shockwave files will pseudo-stream from an HTTP
server.
