<h2 class="sect1">22.2. Converting to the Web Palette</h2>

<p>Designing with web colors is one method to prevent dithering. The
other opportunity is to add (or preserve) web-safe colors in the
conversion process from RGB to Indexed Color. As part of this
process, you will be asked to select a palette for the image. The
colors from the palette will be used to approximate the full color
range from the original RGB graphic. See <a href="ch22_02.htm">the sidebar "Common Palettes"</a> for descriptions of palette options in
popular graphics programs.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-22-SIDEBAR-3" /><blockquote><table cellpadding=3 border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Common Palettes</h4>

<p>All 8-bit Indexed Color images (such as GIF or PNG-8) use a palette
of colors to define the colors in the image. The web palette is just
one of infinite palette possibilities. There are several standard
palettes you can choose from within popular graphics programs.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Exact</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2480" />
<a name="INDEX-2481" />If
the image contains fewer than 256 colors, choosing the Exact palette
option makes a palette out of the actual colors that are found in the
image.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Adaptive</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2482" />This is a
custom palette generated with the most commonly used pixel colors in
the image. It allows for color-depth reduction while preserving the
original character of the image. Because the number of colors is
being reduced, some dithering and color-shifting will occur.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Perceptual (Adobe Photoshop/ImageReady only)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2483" />
<a name="INDEX-2484" />This
creates a custom palette by giving priority to colors for which the
human eye has greater sensitivity. Unlike Adaptive, it is based on
algorithms, not just a pixel count. It generally results in images
with better color integrity than adaptive palette images.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Selective (Adobe Photoshop/ImageReady only)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is similar to Perceptual, but it gives preference to areas of
broad color and the preservation of web-safe colors. It is the
preferred palette for web graphics created with Photoshop/ImageReady.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><a name="INDEX-2485" />
<a name="INDEX-2486" />WebSnap Adaptive (Macromedia Fireworks only)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>An adaptive palette in which colors that are near in value to web
palette colors are converted to the closest web palette color.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>System (Mac/Windows)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2487" />Choosing
either system palette converts the image to the palette of 256 colors
as defined by each operating system.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Uniform</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2488" />This palette
contains an evenly stepped sampling of colors from the RGB spectrum.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Custom</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-2489" />This allows
you to load a palette that was previously saved and apply it to the
current image.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Optimized Median Cut (Paint Shop Pro only)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This reduces the image to a few colors using something similar to an
adaptive palette.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Optimized Octree (Paint Shop Pro only)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use this palette if the original image has just a few colors and you
want to keep those exact colors.

<h3 class="sect2">22.2.1. Applying the Strict Web Palette</h3>

<p>In current graphics tools, one of the palette options is likely to be
"Web" or "Web216," which means that the
resulting 8-bit image will be made up exclusively of colors from the
216 color web-safe palette. Many beginners make the mistake of
applying the web palette to every graphic that is going on a web
page. While "Web" may seem like the logical palette
choice, it isn't appropriate for most images and can reduce
potential quality.
</p>

<p>The problem with applying the strict web palette is that it
doesn't take into account the colors or content of your
original image -- everything will be forced into web colors. Extra
dithering may be introduced in the conversion which may increase file
size. The web palette is also made up of some fairly strange and
extreme colors that won't do your image any favors.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">22.2.2. "Snapping" to Web Colors</h3>
<a name="INDEX-2490" />

<p>The newer graphics
tools (Fireworks and Photoshop 5.5+/ImageReady) offer more
sophisticated methods for applying and preserving web-safe colors in
the conversion process. Instead of changing all the pixel colors in
the image, these tools find the colors that are close in value to
web-safe, and then shift (or "snap") them to their
nearest web-safe neighbor. The snap feature is especially effective
for images that contain a combination of full-color photographic
images and flat, web-safe colors.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-22-SECT-2.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.2.2.1. Macromedia Fireworks</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2491" />Fireworks gives the option of
saving with the "Web Adaptive" palette. It is an adaptive
palette, so the set of colors will be customized for the image, but
any colors that are near in value to web palette colors will shift to
the closest web safe equivalent. A color shifts if it is within 7
bits of a web safe value (e.g., 57-57-57 shifts to 51-51-51, but
60-57-57 does not). There is no way to adjust this tolerance.
Palettes are chosen from the Optimize palette (<a href="ch22_02.htm">Figure 22-2</a>) or the Export Preview dialog box.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-22-SECT-2.2.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.2.2.2. Adobe ImageReady (Photoshop 5.5 and higher)</h3>

<p>In <a name="INDEX-2492" />ImageReady (and within Photoshop
5.5+ using the "Save For Web" feature), you can control
how many colors shift to their nearest web-safe neighbor using the
"Web Snap" slider tool (<a href="ch22_02.htm">Figure 22-3</a>,
left). The higher you set the slider, the more colors shift. This
allows the tool to construct a custom color table for the image while
keeping areas web-safe. (You may need to select "Show
Options" using the small arrow button in the top-right corner
to expose the Web Snap slider in the Optimize palette.)
</p>

<p>The slider works in coordination with one of the adaptive palette
choices ("Adaptive," "Perceptual," or
"Selective"). If your image contains broad areas of flat
color, particularly web-safe color, "Selective" is the
best choice. If the image is mostly photographic, use
"Perceptual."
</p>

<p>ImageReady also allows you to shift colors to their nearest web
equivalents manually using the Color Table palette (<a href="ch22_02.htm">Figure 22-3</a>, right). Clicking on a color in the table and
then the cube icon below shifts it to web-safe (indicated by a
diamond in the center of the swatch). This shifts all the
corresponding pixels within the image. The color can then be locked
down with the lock icon.

<h3 class="sect3">22.2.2.3. Web Scrubber plug-in filter (Furbo Filters)</h3>

<p>If you work on a Mac and haven't yet invested in a web graphics
tool such as ImageReady or Fireworks, you can lay out a smaller chunk
of change for special web utilities that work as plug-ins for
PaintShop Pro, Photoshop 3+, or any program that accepts
Photoshop-compatible plug-ins.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2493" /> <a name="INDEX-2494" />Web Scrubber from
Furbo Filters provides "web-snap" abilities similar to
ImageReady and allows you to reduce the number of colors in a
paletted image. It is particularly good at optimizing images that
contain a combination of photographic imagery and areas of flat,
web-safe color.
</p>

<p>As of this writing, Web Scrubber is available only for the Mac as
part of Furbo Filters' Webmaster series of plug-ins. These
plug-ins are available at <a href="../../../../../../www.furbo-filters.com/">http://www.furbo-filters.com</a>.
