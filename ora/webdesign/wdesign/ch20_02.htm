<h2 class="sect1">20.2. JPEG Compression</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-2358" />JPEG
uses<a name="INDEX-2359" /> what
is known<a name="INDEX-2360" />
as a "lossy" compression<a name="INDEX-2361" />
scheme<a name="INDEX-2362" />,
meanin<a name="INDEX-2363" />g that some image information is
actually thrown out in the compression process. Fortunately, for
photographic images at most compression levels, this loss is not
discernible to the human eye, particularly when the image is
displayed on a monitor at screen resolution (and even less so for
images saved at print resolutions).
</p>

<p>Using "lossy" compression algorithms, JPEG is able to
achieve 10:1 to 20:1 data-compression ratios without visible loss in
quality. Of course, the savings in file size at any given compression
is dependent on the content of the specific image, and results vary.
If maintaining high image quality is not a priority, these ratios can
go even higher.
</p>

<p>The efficiency of JPEG compression is based on the <em class="firstterm">spatial
frequency</em><a name="INDEX-2364" />, or concentration of detail, of the
image. Image areas with low frequency (smooth gradients, like a blue
sky) are compressed much further than areas with higher frequency
(lots of detail, like blades of grass). Even a single sharp color
boundary, although not giving "lots of detail,"
represents a surge in spatial frequency and therefore poses problems
for JPEG compression.
</p>

<p>The compression algorithm samples the image in 8 <img src="figs/U00D7.gif"> 8-pixel
squares and then translates the relative color and brightness
information into mathematical formulas. These sampling squares may
become visible when images are compressed with the highest
compression ratios (lowest quality settings).
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2365" />It is perhaps most meaningful to
compare JPEG and GIF compression on photographic images. A
detail-rich photographic image that takes up 85K of disk space as a
GIF image would require only 35K as a JPEG. Again, the rate of
compression depends on the specific image, but in general, a JPEG
compresses a photographic image two to three times smaller than GIF.
For flat-color graphics, however, GIF is far more efficient than
JPEG.

<h3 class="sect2">20.2.1. Image Loss</h3>

<p>Be aware that once image quality is lost in JPEG compression, you can
never get it back again. Loss in image quality is also cumulative,
meaning you lose a little bit more information each time you
decompress and compress an image. Each time you open a JPEG and
resave it, you degrade the image further. Not only that, you may
introduce new artifacts to the image that prevent the second
compression from working as efficiently as the first, resulting in
higher file sizes.
</p>

<p>It is a good idea to hang on to one copy of the original digital
image if you anticipate having to make changes, so your final image
only goes through the compression process once. You should also start
from an original image each time to experiment with different
compression levels. The new web graphics tools (Fireworks, Photoshop
5.5 and higher, and ImageReady) make this easy because they always
retain the original and allow you to export graphics with your chosen
settings.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-20-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.2.2. Variable Compression Levels</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2366" />One
advantage to JPEGs is that you can control the degree to which the
image is compressed. The higher the quality, the larger the file. The
goal is to find the smallest file size that still maintains
acceptable image quality.
</p>

<p>The quality of a JPEG image is denoted by its "Q"
setting, usually on a scale from 0 to 100. In nearly all programs,
the lower numbers represent lower image quality but better
compression rates (and smaller files). The higher numbers result in
better image quality and larger files.
</p>

<p>For the most part, the Q setting is an arbitrary value with no
specific mathematical significance. It is just a way to specify the
image quality level you'd like to maintain. When JPEG
compression goes to work, it compresses as much as it can while
maintaining the targeted Q setting. The actual compression ratio
depends on the content of the individual image.
</p>

<p>The scales for specifying Q-settings (or "Quality") vary
among tools that create JPEGs. Most current web tools use a scale
from 0 to 100; however, you will still find some that use a scale
from 0 to 10 or 0 to 12. The numbers themselves are not significant
(a 30 in one program may be radically different than 30 in another);
what matters is the way the image looks and its resulting file size.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-20-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.2.3. JPEG Decompression</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2367" />JPEGs need to be decompressed before they
can be displayed; therefore, it takes a browser longer to decode and
assemble a JPEG than a GIF of the same file size. Bear in mind that a
small portion of the download time-savings gained by using a JPEG
instead of a GIF is lost to the added time it takes to display. (Not
much though, so don't sweat it.)
