<p><a name="INDEX-2455" /> <a name="INDEX-2456" />
<a name="INDEX-2457" />The web palette
is a set of 216 colors that will not dither on Macs or PCs and is
built into all the major browsers (it is discussed in more detail in
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Web Design Principles for Print Designers"</a>). When a browser is running on a
computer with an 8-bit monitor (capable of displaying only 256 colors
at a time), the browser refers to its internal web palette to make up
the colors on the page.
</p>

<p>If the browser is running on a 24-bit display, the web palette does
not come into effect and all colors are displayed accurately. See
<a href="ch22_01.htm">the sidebar "When Not to Worry About the Web Palette"</a> for
other instances when the web palette does not apply.
</p>

<p>Most often, remapping images to the web palette in the browser
results in undesirable dithering. Not only that, sometimes flat
colors shift to the nearest web-safe colors without dithering. The
algorithm for deciding which colors to shift and which to dither (as
well as choosing <em class="emphasis">where</em> to shift) differs
depending on the browser brand and version.
</p>

<p>All of this shifting and dithering means unpredictable image quality
on 8-bit monitors. But there is one thing that is
predictable -- the web palette. If you use colors from the web
palette in the image in the first place, you have the advantage of
controlling how the image appears on 8-bit monitors. It requires a
little extra effort and an adjustment to a limited color choice, but
the payoff is that you, not the browser, control whether and how the
image dithers.
</p>

<p>There are two opportunities to apply the web palette in the image
creation process. The first is to choose web-safe colors when you
design the image (particularly for areas of flat color). The web
palette can also be applied to the image when reducing it to Indexed
Color.
</p>

<p>This chapter looks at both approaches to using the web palette in
graphics. The techniques apply to graphics that use 8-bit palettes
such as GIF or PNG. Because PNG is not widely supported at this time,
GIF is featured in the following examples.

<h4 class="objtitle">When Not to Worry About the Web Palette</h4>

<p>There are some instances when you don't need to be concerned
with the web palette:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>If you don't care about performance on 8-bit monitors</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The web palette only comes into play on 8-bit monitors; 16- and
24-bit monitors can accurately display just about any image. As of
this writing, only about 5-7% of web users have 8-bit displays.</p>

<p>However, in the interest of keeping the lowest common denominator in
mind, web designers continue to use web palette colors in their GIFs.
You may find that your clients still insist upon it to maintain
consistent quality.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>If your image is primarily photographic</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>First, if you're starting with a purely photographic image, you
should save it in JPEG format. But let's say you have a good
reason for saving it as a GIF. Because the image is going to dither
anyway when you reduce its colors, and because dithering can be
beneficial in photographs, you do not need to apply the web palette.
Selecting an adaptive palette (a customized palette based on the
colors most used in the image) is a better choice during the
conversion process for maintaining the quality of the image.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>If your image is in the JPEG format</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The web palette is irrelevant for JPEG images because they are
24-bit, nonpaletted images by definition. In addition, even if you
have flat areas of web-safe colors in your original image, they will
get shifted and distorted during the JPEG compression process.

<h2 class="sect1">22.1. Designing with Web-Safe Colors</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-2458" /> <a name="INDEX-2459" />If you are creating graphics from
scratch, especially graphics such as logos or simple illustrations
that contain areas of flat color, you can use web palette colors
right from the start. In this way, you can be certain that your
graphics will look the same for all users. <a href="ch22_01.htm">Figure 22-1</a> shows how dithering could have been avoided if
the image had used colors from the web-safe palette. Remember,
it's the flat color areas where using web-safe colors makes the
most difference.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-22-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="292" alt="Figure 22-1" src="figs/WDN2_2201.gif" width="430" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 22-1. Designing with web-safe colors prevents dithering</h4>

<p>The major drawback is that with only 216 colors to choose from (a
good 30 of which you'd never be caught dead using for
anything), the selection is extremely limited. (See <a href="ch22_04.htm">Section 22.4, "Color Blenders"</a> in this chapter for one
approach to overcoming the limited choice of colors.)
</p>

<p>The trick is to have the web palette colors available in a Swatches
palette or in whatever device your graphics program uses for making
colors handy. You should be aware, however, that even if you select
web colors for fills, any shades of colors created by soft drop
shadows or anti-aliased edges between areas of color will probably
not be web-safe.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-22-SIDEBAR-2" /><blockquote><table cellpadding=3 border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Web Palette on 16-Bit Displays</h4>

<p><a name="INDEX-2460" />Because
16-bit (also called "high color") displays must
mathematically approximate colors from the true color space, slight
color shifting and dithering occurs even if you choose colors from
the "safe" web palette. Unfortunately, over half of web
users today use 16-bit monitors, which means that your colors
aren't looking the way you think over half the time.
</p>

<p>This is most noticeable for pages with graphics that are intended to
blend seamlessly with a tiled background graphic or specified
background color. Although the foreground and background elements may
have identical web-safe RGB values, on 16-bit displays, colors shift
and dither in a way that causes the "seams" to be
slightly visible.
</p>

<p>Which elements shift and which get dithered seems to depend on the
browser and operating system combination, so it's difficult to
anticipate. If the mismatched colors concern you, making the edges of
your graphics transparent instead of a matching color may help
eliminate the dithered rectangles on 16-bit displays.
</p>

<p>Webmonkey (an online developers' magazine) has an article
called "Death of the Websafe Color Palette?" by David
Lehn and Hadley Stern that does a great job of explaining how
web-safe colors fail in the 16-bit environment. It includes a
thorough technical explanation of how 16-bit color works as well as
results of their web palette testing. It is available at <a href="../../../../../../hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/00/37/index2a.html">http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/00/37/index2a.html</a>.

<p>Not surprisingly, with the explosion of the Web's popularity,
the web palette is finding its way into many commercial graphics

<h3 class="sect2">22.1.2. Color Look-Up Tables (CLUT Files)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2474" /> <a name="INDEX-2475" />Photoshop and some other
graphics tools save palettes in files called CLUTs (Color Look-Up
Table). To make the web palette available in the Swatches palette,
you need to load the appropriate web CLUT file using Load Swatches,
Replace Swatches, or some equivalent command.

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-22-SECT-1.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">22.1.2.1. Creating a CLUT file in Photoshop 4.0</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2476" />Photoshop 5.0 ships with the Web Safe
Colors CLUT file in its Color Palettes folder, but Photoshop 4.0 does
not. If you are using Version 4.0, it's easy enough to create
one as follows:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Convert any RGB image to Indexed Color.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Indexed Color dialog, select Web from the Palette pop-up menu.
Click OK.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select Image <img alt="Figure 22.1.2.1" src="figs/U2192.gif" /> Mode <img alt="Figure 22.1.2.1" src="figs/U2192.gif" /> Color Table. Although the Table
pop-up lists Custom as the current option, the table itself contains
the 216 browser-safe RGB values.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the Save button, and save the color palette. Name it
descriptively and save it into Photoshop's Color Palettes
folder.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Load these colors into the Swatches Palette by choosing Replace
Swatches from the Swatches Palette submenu.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Now you can select from swatches of web-safe colors to fill areas of
your graphic. If you don't want to create the CLUT file
yourself, you can download it from Lynda Weinman's FTP site, as
explained in the following section.
