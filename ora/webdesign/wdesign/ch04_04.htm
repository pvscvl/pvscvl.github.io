<h2 class="sect1">4.4. Uploading Documents (FTP)</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-321" />
<a name="INDEX-322" /> <a name="INDEX-323" />The most<a name="INDEX-324" /> <a name="INDEX-325" /> common transaction that
a web designer will have with a web server is the uploading of HTML
documents, graphics, and other media files. Files are transferred
between computers over a network via a method called FTP
(<em class="emphasis">File Transfer Protocol).</em> 
</p>

<p>If you are working in a telnet session on Unix, you can run the
<em class="emphasis">ftp</em> program and transfer files with a hefty
collection of command-line arguments (not covered in this book).
</p>

<p>Fortunately, if you work on a Mac or PC, there are a number of FTP
programs with graphical interfaces that spare you the experience of
transferring files using the Unix command line. In fact, FTP
functions are now built right into full-featured web authoring tools,
such as <a name="INDEX-326" />GoLive,
<a name="INDEX-327" />
<a name="INDEX-328" />Dreamweaver,
and FrontPage, among others. On the Mac, dedicated programs that
allow "drag-and-drop" file transfer, such as
<a name="INDEX-329" />
<a name="INDEX-330" />Fetch and
Interarchy (previously Anarchie), are quite popular. On the PC, there
are numerous simple FTP programs, such as <a name="INDEX-331" /> <a name="INDEX-332" />WS_FTP, AceFTP, and Transmit. These (and
many others) are available for download at <a href="../../../../../../www.shareware.com/">http://www.shareware.com</a> (search for
"ftp").
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-333" /> <a name="INDEX-334" />Navigator
and Internet Explorer browsers also function as FTP clients, offering
the ability to both download and upload files with a drag-and-drop
interface.

<h3 class="sect2">4.4.1. The FTP Process</h3>

<p>Regardless of the tool you use, the basic principles and processes
are the same. Before you begin, you must have an account with
permission to upload files to the server. Check with the server
administrator to be sure you have a login name and a password.
</p>

<p>You don't necessarily need an account to upload and download
files if the server is set up as an "anonymous" FTP site.
However, due to obvious security implications, be sure that your
personal directories are not configured to be accessible to all
anonymous users.
</p>

<ol><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Launch the FTP program</b> of your
choice and open a connection with your server. You'll need to
enter the exact name of the server, your account name, and password.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Locate the appropriate directory</b>
into which you want to copy your files. You may also choose to create
a new directory or delete existing files and directories on the
remote server using the controls in your FTP program. (Note that some
servers allow you to enter the complete pathname to the directory
before logging in.)
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Specify the transfer mode.</b> The most
important decision to make during uploading is specifying whether the
data should be transferred in
<em class="emphasis">binary</em><a name="INDEX-335" /> or
<em class="emphasis">ASCII</em><a name="INDEX-336" /> mode.
</p>

<p>ASCII files are comprised of alphanumeric characters. Some FTP
programs refer to ASCII files as "Text" files. HTML
documents should be transferred as ASCII or text.
</p>

<p>Binary files are made up of compiled data (ones and zeros), such as
executable programs, graphic images, movies, etc. Some programs refer
to the binary mode as "raw data" or "Image."
All graphics (<em class="filename">.gif</em>, <em class="filename">.jpeg</em>)
and multimedia files should be transferred as "binary" or
"Raw Data." <a href="ch04_05.htm">Table 4-1</a> includes a
listing of the transfer mode for a number of popular file types.
</p>

<p>In Fetch (Mac), you may see a
<em class="emphasis">MacBinary</em><a name="INDEX-337" /> option, which transfers the file with
its resource fork (the bit of the file containing desktop icons and
other Mac-specific data) intact. It should only be used when
transferring from one Mac to another. This resource fork is
appropriately stripped out of Mac-generated media files when
transferred under the standard raw data mode.
</p>

<p>Some FTP programs also provide an
<em class="emphasis">Auto</em><a name="INDEX-338" /> option, which enables you to
transfer whole directories containing files of both types. The
program examines each file and determines whether it should be
transferred as text or binary information. This function is not 100%
reliable on all programs, so use it with caution until you are
positive you are getting good results.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Upload your files to the server.</b>
Standard FTP uses the terminology "put" (uploading files
from your computer to the server) and "get" (downloading
files from the server to your computer), so these terms may be used
in your FTP program as well. You can also upload multiple files at a
time.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Disconnect.</b> When you have completed
the transfer, be sure to disconnect from the server. You may want to
test the files you've uploaded on a browser first to make sure
everything transferred successfully.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">4.4.2. Setting Permissions</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-339" />When you upload files to a web server, you
need to be sure that the files' permissions are set so that
everyone is able to read your files.
<em class="firstterm">Permissions</em><a name="INDEX-340" /> control who can
read, write (edit), or execute (if it is a program) the file, and
they need to be established for the owner of the file, the
file's group, and for "everyone." When you create
or upload a file, you are automatically the owner, which may mean
that only you can set the permissions.
</p>

<p>Some FTP programs enable you to set the default upload permissions
via a dialog box. <a href="ch04_04.htm">Figure 4-6</a> shows Fetch
3.0.4's dialog box for doing this. For most web purposes, you
want to grant yourself full permissions but restrict all other users
to read-only. You may want to confirm that your server administrator
agrees with these settings.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-4-FIG-6" /><div class="figure"><img height="185" alt="Figure 4-6" src="figs/WDN2_0406.gif" width="192" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-6. Standard permissions settings (using Fetch 3.0.4)</h4>

<p>The server needs to be specially configured to recognize these
permissions commands, so check with your administrator to see if you
can use this easy method. He or she will give you instructions if any
special permissions settings are necessary.
