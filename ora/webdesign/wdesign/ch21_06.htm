<h2 class="sect1">21.6. Special Features</h2>

<p>You may choose to use a PNG (in that perfect world) for some of its
advanced features that no other graphic offers, such as variable
transparency levels and full color management systems for automatic
image correction, including gamma and color balance corrections.

<h3 class="sect2">21.6.1. Interlacing (Progressive Display)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2430" />
<a name="INDEX-2431" />Like
GIFs, PNGs can be encoded for interlaced display. When this option is
selected, the image displays in a series of passes, the first
displaying after only a portion of the file has been downloaded, and
each subsequent pass increasing in detail and clarity until the whole
image is rendered.
</p>

<p>Interlaced PNGs display over a series of seven passes (using a method
known as "Adam7," named for its creator, Adam Costello).
The first rendering of the image appears after only 1/64 of the file
has downloaded (that's eight times faster than GIF). Unlike
GIF, which fills in horizontal rows of information, PNGs fill in both
horizontally and vertically (the effect looks more like the display
of progressive JPEGs). Interlacing can add to the file size of PNGs,
especially on small images (which don't really need to be
interlaced anyway). To keep file sizes as small as possible, turn
interlacing off.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-21-SECT-6.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.6.2. Gamma Correction</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2432" />
<a name="INDEX-2433" />Briefly stated,
<em class="firstterm">gamma</em> refers to the brightness setting of a
monitor (for more information on gamma, see <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Web Design Principles for Print Designers"</a>). Because gamma settings vary by platform (and
even by manufacturer), the graphics you create may not look the way
you intend. In general, graphics created on Macs look dark on PCs and
graphics created on PCs look washed out on Macs.
</p>

<p>PNGs can be tagged with information regarding the gamma setting of
the platform on which they were created. This information can then be
interpreted by software on the user's end (the browser) to make
appropriate gamma compensations. When this is implemented on both the
creator and end-user's side, the PNG retains its intended
brightness and color intensity.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-21-SECT-6.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.6.3. Transparency</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2434" />Both 24-bit and 8-bit indexed color PNGs
can have variable levels of transparency. This sophisticated
transparency function allows for smooth transitions between
foreground and background elements. Grayscale images can also have
variable transparency. PNGs can also use simple binary transparency
(like transparent GIFs), in which a pixel is either totally
transparent or totally opaque.
</p>

<p>PNGs handle transparency in two ways: using an alpha channel (think
of it as a separate layer that keeps track of the transparent areas
of the image) or adding transparency information within the index
color table for 8-bit palette images. The 8-bit palette transparency
results in smaller file sizes for the same effect and is preferable
for Web use. Both methods are discussed further below.
</p>

<p>As of this writing, the only common tools that allow you to create
transparency information in PNGs are Adobe Photoshop (4.0 and
higher), Adobe ImageReady, Macromedia Fireworks, the GIMP (an
image-editing tool for Unix, Linux, and OS/2), and PaintShop Pro (4.0
and higher). Photoshop currently supports only 24-bit transparency,
which results in unacceptably large files. ImageReady and Fireworks
both support the more complicated 8-bit, palette-based transparency.
</p>

<p>Transparency techniques are discussed in <a href="ch21_07.htm">Section 21.7, "Creating PNG Files"</a> section of this chapter.
</p>

<p>Bear in mind that even if you manage to make a PNG file with
transparency, it may be a challenge finding a browser to display it
correctly (particularly the preferable 8-bit indexed color
transparency). Refer back to <a href="ch21_03.htm">Table 21-1</a> for browser
support information.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-21-SECT-6.3.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">21.6.3.1. Alpha channel transparency</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2435" />
<a name="INDEX-2436" />In addition to the standard
channels for RGB color values for truecolor images, PNGs may contain
an additional alpha channel used for transparency information. Each
pixel is then defined by its RGBA values. For 24-bit images, the
alpha channel can contain up to 8 bits of information for 256 levels
of transparency for every pixel in the image. The alpha channel may
also contain simple binary transparency information, like GIFs. Keep
in mind, however, that an RGB PNG file with alpha channels will be
about 20% larger than one without.
</p>

<p>48-bit PNGs may contain an alpha channel with 16 bits of
information -- that's over 65,000 levels of transparency!
48-bit images, however, are inappropriate for the Web.
</p>

<p>In practical terms, this means you can create glows and soft drop
shadows that allow background patterns and underlying images to show
through in a realistic manner. <a href="ch21_06.htm">Figure 21-1</a>
illustrates the effect of graphics showing through areas with
variable levels of transparency.
</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-21-SECT-6.3.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">21.6.3.2. 8-bit transparency</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2437" />Indexed
color PNGs can also contain variable levels of transparency (up to
256 levels); however, this information is not handled in a distinct
alpha channel as for 24-bit images. Instead, transparency information
for each color occupies positions in the color table. So, if you have
a red area that fades out using eight levels of transparency, that
red would be present in eight slots in the color table, each with its
own transparency setting. In other words, each slot in the color
table can store RGBA information. Other than adding to the number of
pixel colors in the color table, adding transparency to an 8-bit PNG
does not significantly increase its file size, making it the way to
go for web graphics where file size is crucial.

<h3 class="sect2">21.6.4. Embedded Text</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2438" />
<a name="INDEX-2439" />PNGs also have the ability to store strings
of text. This is useful in permanently attaching text to an image,
such as copyright information or a description of what is in the
image. Unfortunately, the only browser that supports embedded text is
Internet Explorer 5 for the Mac, but someday it may be available via
a right-button context menu or some other method on all browsers and
platforms. The only tools that allow text annotations to PNG graphics
are Paint Shop Pro and the GIMP (a free image editor for the X
Windows system on Unix). Fireworks will preserve embedded text
information in PNGs.
