<a name="INDEX-1894" />For those frustrated with the limited control
over document presentation provided by straight HTML markup,
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a welcome advance in web design.
They are also the official W3C standard for controlling all
presentation, leaving HTML markup to indicate structure as it was
designed to do.
</p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="wdnut2-CHP-17-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">17.1. Using Style Sheets</h2>

<p>Like their counterparts in desktop publishing page-layout programs,
style sheets in HTML allow authors to apply typographic styles and
spacing instructions for elements on a page. The word
<em class="emphasis">cascading</em> refers to what happens when several
sources of style information vie for control of the elements on a
page -- style information is passed down from higher-level style
sheets (and from parent to child element within a document) until it
is overridden by a style command with more weight. (The cascading
rules are discussed in detail later in this chapter.)
</p>

<p>This comes as good news both for designers who want more control over
presentation and for HTML purists who stand by the principle that
style should be separate from content and structure. Style sheets
make both these dreams possible, but it is important to be aware of
their advantages and disadvantages.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-17-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.1.1. Advantages</h3>

<p>Style sheets offer the following advantages to web designers:</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Greater typography and page layout
controls.</b> With style sheets, you can specify traditional
typography attributes such as font size, line spacing, and letter
spacing. Style sheets also offer methods for specifying indents,
margins, and element positioning, and they even use terminology from
traditional and desktop publishing, such as points and em spaces.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Style is separate from structure.</b>
HTML is designed for indicating the structure of a document, to which
presentation is applied by the end user's browsing device. Over
recent years, however, HTML has been extended to provide greater
control over presentation (the <tt class="literal">&lt;font&gt;</tt> tag
being the most infamous example). Style sheets, when done correctly,
mark the return to the original intent of HTML by removing
presentation instructions from HTML and placing them in a separate,
optional area.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Potentially smaller documents</b>.
Placing font specifications once at the beginning of the document
instead of using a <tt class="literal">&lt;font&gt;</tt> description for
every individual element can drastically cut down on the number of
characters in the document, thus reducing its file size. As always
with the Web, it is desirable to keep file sizes (and download times)
as small as possible.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Easier site maintenance.</b> It is
possible to link multiple HTML pages to a single style sheet, which
means not only can you make one change that affects every instance of
that element on a single HTML page, but you can also make style
changes to hundreds or thousands of web pages by editing a single
file.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">It's easy to learn.</b> Creating
basic style sheets is no more difficult than tagging documents, once
you learn the syntax rules. To make the job even easier, style sheet
functions are now built into web authoring tools like Macromedia
Dreamweaver and Adobe GoLive.
</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-17-SECT-1.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.1.2. Disadvantages</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1895" /> <a name="INDEX-1896" /> <a name="INDEX-1897" />As of this writing, the sole drawback
to implementing style sheets remains uneven browser support. First,
style sheet information is not supported in browser versions earlier
than Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or Netscape Navigator 4.0. That
is not as frustrating as the inconsistency of support among browsers
and versions that claim they <em class="emphasis">do</em> support CSS.
</p>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium first published its recommendation for
style sheets in 1996, and they were first implemented by Internet
Explorer 3.0. Since then, as usual, Microsoft and Netscape have
chosen diverging paths in the properties their browsers support and
the way those properties are presented. The browser-support charts in
<a href="appe_01.htm">Appendix E, "CSS Support Chart"</a> are evidence of the gap in style sheet
implementations. A constantly updated browser support list is
maintained online by Eric Meyer for WebReview at <a href="../../../../../../www.webreview.com/style/css1/charts/mastergrid.shtml">http://www.webreview.com/style/css1/charts/mastergrid.shtml</a>.
</p>

<p>The good news is that the outlook continues to improve with the
release of standards-compliant browsers and as older versions fade
away. Internet Explorer 5.5 and higher and Netscape 6 claim to
support almost all of the CSS Level 1 specification and parts of CSS
Level 2 (the latest version as of this writing). With an estimated
95% of web users surfing with 4.0 or higher version browsers, you can
safely assume that basic styles (font, size, and color, for example)
will reach the vast majority of your audience.

<h3 class="sect2">17.1.3. Strategies for Using Style Sheets Today</h3>

<p>Although consistent browser support for style sheets remains a large
issue, that does not mean that you should abandon them completely. In
fact, many large commercial and consumer-oriented sites are taking
advantage of the power of style sheets today. Here are a few
strategies for adding styles to your site:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Include end
tags.</b><a name="INDEX-1898" />
While current browsers don't mind if you leave off the
<tt class="literal">&lt;/p&gt;</tt> or <tt class="literal">&lt;/li&gt;</tt> tag,
style sheets (and other web technologies such as XML) do mind. It is
necessary to have clearly defined text elements, including both tags.
If you think you may be adding style sheet functionality to your site
in the future, get ready by closing all your tags today.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Use style sheets as
"icing."</b> One way to create a site that
degrades well to any browser is to first create a site free of style
sheets that is acceptable on all browser and platform configurations.
Once you are happy with it, add style sheet information that will not
affect the display in older browsers (such as
<tt class="literal">&lt;div&gt;</tt> and <tt class="literal">&lt;span</tt>&gt;,
and the <tt class="literal">class</tt> attribute). Choosing properties that
are fully supported by the major browsers (see <a href="appe_01.htm">Appendix E, "CSS Support Chart"</a>) will broaden the chances your design will be
seen as you intend it.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Serve different styles to different
browsers.</b>
<a name="INDEX-1899" />Another approach is to develop two
versions of your site and deliver the proper version using a
browser-detect JavaScript. You might have a fully-styled version that
is aimed at the standards-compliant browsers (Internet Explorer 5.5+,
Netscape 6, and Opera5) and another "vanilla" version
that is stable without style sheets for everyone else. Since
Navigator 4.x is particularly buggy, you can hold back certain style
information from it using the <tt class="literal">@import</tt> method of
style sheet application (which Navigator 4 does not support) along
with or instead of <tt class="literal">&lt;link&gt;</tt>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold"> Use style sheets for
intranets</b><a name="INDEX-1900" />.
If you have the good fortune to be designing a site for which you
know the exact browser/platform configuration for all your users
(such as a corporate intranet or a self-contained kiosk display),
feel free to use the supported style sheets to their limits.
</p>
</li></ul>
</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-17-SECT-1.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.1.4. The Future of Style Sheets</h3>

<p>Despite a bumpy start, style sheets still hold great promise as the
preferred method for specifying page presentation. The Web Standards
Organization (<a href="../../../../../../www.webstandards.org/">http://www.webstandards.org</a>), an industry
watchdog group that educates the web community on the importance of
standards, urges web authors and developers to begin using style
sheets right away. Kiss your <tt class="literal">&lt;font&gt;</tt> tag
goodbye!
</p>

<p>In 1998, the W3C published its second style sheet proposal (CSS Level
2, or CSS2), which includes additional properties and advanced
methods for absolute positioning that could make tables and frames as
layout devices a thing of the past. Style sheets are also a key
component to programming dynamic effects with DHTML. CSS Level 3 is
already being considered. (Both CSS2 and CSS3 are discussed later in
this chapter.)

<h3 class="sect2">17.1.5. For Further Reading</h3>

<p>Not surprisingly, the place to go for information on Cascading Style
Sheets is the W3C's site at <a href="../../../../../../www.w3.org/style/CSS">http://www.w3.org/style/CSS</a>. The full CSS1
recommendation is located at <a href="../../../../../../www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1</a>; for CSS2, see
<a href="../../../../../../www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2</a>.
</p>

<p>Another great resource (and one that's easier to digest than
the specs themselves) is the book <em class="citetitle">Cascading Style Sheets:
The Definitive Guide</em> by Eric Meyer (O'Reilly,
2000). Eric has also written many useful articles on style sheets for
WebReview magazine (<a href="../../../../../../www.webreview.com/">http://www.webreview.com</a>). There you'll
also find his CSS browser compatibility charts (<a href="../../../../../../www.webreview.com/style/">http://www.webreview.com/style/</a>).
