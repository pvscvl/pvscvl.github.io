<p>Both mobile devices and the Internet have exploded into widespread
use in the past few years, so it stands to reason that the two would
be combined. One technology for delivering information to wireless
devices (primarily mobile phones, but also pagers and personal
digital assistants) is WAP, the <a name="INDEX-3007" /> <a name="INDEX-3008" />Wireless Application
Protocol. WAP is a collection of protocols and specifications that
work together to give mobile phones access to Internet-like
information.
</p>

<p>One part of the WAP standard is the <a name="INDEX-3009" /> <a name="INDEX-3010" />Wireless Markup Language
(WML), which is used to create wireless applications just as HTML is
used to create web pages. WML is an application of XML, meaning that
it is defined in a document type definition, or DTD (for more
information on XML, see <a href="ch30_01.htm">Chapter 30, "Introduction to XML"</a>).
</p>

<p>The goal of WAP is not to port existing web sites onto mobile phones,
because the small screen size and limited bandwidth make that
impractical. Rather, it is a system for creating special applications
tailored to handheld devices. That is why you often see the phrase
"Internet-like information" used in regards to WAP. WAP
is good for delivering short, pithy bits of data, such as stock
prices, sports scores, movie times, and so on. It is not useful for
the complex documents with visual layouts that have made the World
Wide Web what it is today.
</p>

<p>Many traditional web designers feel pressure to keep up with the Web
as it extends into the world of wireless devices. The truth is that
unless you make a career shift into wireless application development,
it is unlikely that you will be required to design specifically for
handheld devices. Still, it is helpful to be familiar with the basics
of what is going on in the wireless space.
</p>

<p>This chapter begins with a brief introduction to WAP and application
development. The second half focuses on WML and how it works,
including a summary of the elements and attributes in the current WML
specification.

<h2 class="sect1">32.1. About WAP</h2>

<p>As I just mentioned, WAP is not a single entity, but rather a list of
protocols and specifications. It is being developed under the
guidance of the Wireless Application Protocol Forum, originally
founded by wireless industry leaders Nokia, Motorola, Ericsson, and
Unwired Planet (which evolved into Phone.com and is currently
Openwave). The WAP Forum web site (<a href="../../../../../../www.wapforum.org/">http://www.wapforum.org</a>) is a good resource
for the current state of wireless communications, including the
complete WAP specification documents.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-32-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">32.1.1. The Wireless Environment</h3>

<p>WAP addresses the special limitations and requirements of mobile
phones and similar devices. The distinguishing characteristics are:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Small screen size. Only a small amount of information can be
displayed at once.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Limited processing power.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Lack of a full keyboard, making it awkward for the user to enter
information. There are some handheld devices that feature a full
keyboard, but they are the exception.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Slow connection speeds. Currently, wireless connection speeds are
around 9600 bits per second.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Costly access. Users are generally paying by the minute or the
kilobyte to use a wireless application. It is important to allow them
to access information quickly.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>All of these factors guide the development of WAP technology and the
design process of WAP application developers.

<h4 class="objtitle">Alternatives to WAP</h4>

<p>While WAP is gaining worldwide support, it is not the only system out
there for delivering information to wireless devices. Before WAP,
pages were delivered using HTTP connections and a mobile-friendly
markup language called HDML (see <a href="ch32_02.htm">the sidebar "About HDML"</a> later in this chapter). Many phones
still support standard HTML content.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-3011" />iMode (created by
<a name="INDEX-3012" />NTT DoCoMo, <a href="../../../../../../www.nttdocomo.com/">http://www.nttdocomo.com</a>) is another wireless
communication system that has taken off like wildfire in Japan. iMode
phones typically have full-color displays that are capable of
displaying graphical layouts and even games. iMode documents are
created using a subset of HTML elements (see <a href="../../../../../../www.nttdocomo.com/i/tag/index.html">http://www.nttdocomo.com/i/tag/index.html</a> for
a complete list).
</p>

<p>Many people see the current version of WAP as an interim solution
that will eventually be replaced by IPv6 on the protocol side and XML
on the markup side. Of course, in the telecom world, once an interim
solution gets out in the market, it can have a surprisingly long
life, so WAP as it stands today is likely to be around for a while.

<h3 class="sect2">32.1.2. How WAP Works</h3>

<p>A WAP application is formatted using WML and WMLScript, the scripting
language for adding interactivity to wireless applications. These
files can be served from an ordinary HTTP (web) server.
</p>

<p>WAP-enabled devices communicate with the web server through a
<em class="firstterm">WAP gateway </em><a name="INDEX-3013" />(<a href="ch32_01.htm">Figure 32-1</a>). The
gateway acts as an intermediary between the Internet and the mobile
network, converting WAP requests into HTTP requests. A wireless
device (such as a mobile phone) requests information via the airwaves
to the gateway. The gateway uses the Internet via HTTP to request and
receive a WML document from the web server.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-32-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="150" alt="Figure 32-1" src="figs/WDN2_3201.gif" width="389" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 32-1. Mobile devices access web servers through a gateway</h4>

<p>Upon arriving at the gateway, the document gets
<em class="firstterm">compiled</em><a name="INDEX-3014" /> into
WAP <a name="INDEX-3015" />Binary XML
(<a name="INDEX-3016" />
<a name="INDEX-3017" />WBXML) before it is sent to the phone.
The compilation process reduces the file size by replacing tags with
specific single-character codes, and removing comments and extra
white space. Once the document has been compiled, it is returned via
the airwaves to the mobile phone.
</p>

<p>WAP gateways are normally owned by wireless service providers, so you
don't need your own gateway to provide WAP applications (unless
you're a bank or some similar institution of means). You can
serve your content from a regular, properly configured web server.
The WAP gateway will find your information as any other web client
would.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-32-SECT-1.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">32.1.3. Serving WAP Content</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-3018" />In order to serve the documents necessary
for a WAP application, you need to configure the server to recognize
a few new <a name="INDEX-3019" />MIME (file) types, listed in <a href="ch32_01.htm">Table 32-1</a>. MIME types are explained in <a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "A Beginner's Guide to the Server"</a>. Follow the instructions for your particular
server for installing new file types.
