<h2 class="sect1">24.5. Web Audio Formats</h2>

<p>At last, we get to the heart of web audio -- the various file
formats. This section provides an introduction to some of the most
common formats for web audio.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-24-SECT-5.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">24.5.1. WAV/AIFF (.wav, .aif, .aiff)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2623" />The
WAV and AIFF audio formats are very similar in peformance. The
Waveform Audio File Format (<em class="filename">.wav</em>) was originally
developed as the standard audio format for the Microsoft Windows
operating system, but it is now supported on the Macintosh as well.
WAV files can support arbitrary sampling rates and bit depths,
although 8 KHz and 11.025 KHz at 8- or 16-bit are most common for Web
use.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2624" />The Audio Interchange File Format
(<em class="filename">.aif</em> or <em class="filename">.aiff</em>) was
developed as the standard audio format for the Macintosh platform,
but it is now supported by Windows and other platforms. It can
support up to six channels and arbitrary sampling rates and bit
depths, with 8 KHz and 11.127 KHz at 8- and 16-bits being the most
common online.
</p>

<p>WAV and AIFF files are less commonly used on the Web than they once
were, now that we have audio formats that are better suited for web
delivery (MP3) or designed specifically for the Web (streaming
formats). WAV and AIFF files are typically used as the source format
for audio that then gets compressed into more web-friendly formats,
like RealAudio. They sound good when uncompressed, but they suffer
drastic loss of quality when compressed to small file sizes. For this
reason they are useful for very short, downloadable audio clips, such
as short greetings. They are usually added to web pages via a link
for download.
</p>

<p>The following summarizes the WAV and AIFF formats:</p>

<h3 class="sect2">24.5.2. MP3 (.mp3)</h3>

<p>MP3's explosion in popularity is nothing short of a phenomenon
and has changed the way we use and view the Internet. The key to its
success is MP3's ability to maintain excellent sound fidelity
at very small file sizes. In fact, its compression scheme can reduce
an audio source to just one-tenth of its original size. For instance,
four minutes of high-quality music in WAV format requires 40 MB of
disk space; as an MP3, the same file weighs in at just 3.5 MB! With
the discovery of MP3, it was suddenly feasible to transfer songs over
the Internet without prohibitive download times. The rest is history.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-24-SECT-5.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">24.5.2.1. MPEG compression</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2625" />The MP3s
that we've grown to love are technically MPEG-1, Layer-III
files. MPEG is actually a family of multimedia standards created by
the Moving Picture Experts Group. It supports three types of
information: video, audio, and streaming (which, in the context of
MPEG compression, is synchronized video and audio).
</p>

<p>MPEG uses a lossy compression scheme that is based on human auditory
perception. Sounds that are not discernible to the human ear are
thrown out in the compression process. The resulting file sounds
nearly the same, but contains much less data than the original.
</p>

<p>There are a number of MPEG standards: MPEG-1 was originally developed
for video transfer at VHS quality and is the format used for MP3s;
MPEG-2 is a higher-quality standard that was developed for television
broadcast; other MPEG specs that address other needs (such as MPEG-4
and -7) are currently in development. MPEGs can be compressed using
one of three schemes: Layer-I, -II, or -III (the "3" in
MP3 refers to its compression scheme layer). To learn more about
MPEG, visit the MPEG web site (<a href="../../../../../../www.mpeg.org/">http://www.mpeg.org</a>).
</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-24-SECT-5.2.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">24.5.2.2. Creating MP3s</h3>

<p>Any audio source file (usually a WAV or AIFF file) can be turned into
an MP3 using an MP3 encoder such as Xing AudioCatalyst, iTunes (Mac),
or MusicMatch Jukebox. For a complete list of MP3 creation tools, see
MP3-Converter.com (<a href="../../../../../../www.mp3-converter.com/">http://www.mp3-converter.com</a>).
</p>

<p>To make an MP3, begin with raw audio saved in WAV or AIFF format. If
the audio is coming from a CD, it will need to be
"ripped" first (extracted from the CD format and saved in
a format a computer can understand). The next step is to encode the
raw audio into the MP3 format. Many MP3 tools rip and encode audio
tracks in one step.
</p>

<p>When encoding, you'll be asked to set the quality level, or bit
rate. The standard quality setting for putting music on the Internet
is 128 Kbps (which is near-CD quality sound) at 44.1 kHz. For
personal use (to play from your computer or portable MP3 player), you
can use the next higher levels (160 or 192 Kbps). To keep file sizes
extra small, choose 112 Kbps or lower, but expect a loss in audio
quality. In order to stream MP3s at rates acceptable for 28.8 modem
users, many MP3 online "radio" stations use 22.05K mono
files compessed at a mere 24 Kbps.
</p>

<p>You'll also need decide whether you want to make CBR (contant
bit rate) or VBR (variable bit rate) files. Variable bit rate MP3s
adjust their bit rate based on the complexity of the current audio
passage. Variable bit rate MP3s can provide an enormous increase in
quality at similar bit rates, but because VBR is inconsistently
supported, the most reliable choice is CBR. Most of the new MP3
players support VBR, so keep an eye out for VBR to gain more support
in the coming years.
</p>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-24-SECT-5.2.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">24.5.2.3. Serving MP3s</h3>

<p>MP3s can be served from a traditional FTP or HTTP server. MP3s can
also be streamed using server solutions such as SHOUTcast (discussed
later in this section) or RealServer 8. Along with the main
advantages of streaming, this means that the MP3 file is not actually
downloaded to the user's computer, providing better copyright
protection.
</p>

<p>And speaking of copyright, remember that while there is no problem
creating MP3s for your own personal use, it is illegal to upload and
distribute audio if you do not hold the copyright for it.
</p>

<p>One of the most popular software packages used for streaming MP3s is
SHOUTcast from Nullsoft. It makes it possible for people to broadcast
audio from their PCs with a minimum amount of hardware and knowledge,
over any speed Internet connection (although more bandwidth certainly
helps). You can broadcast MP3s to individual users or to many users
at once by redirecting your stream to a high-bandwidth server. To
listen to a SHOUTcast server stream, open Winamp (or any other
stream-capable MP3 player) and bring up the Open Location dialog box.
Enter the URL of the server you want to listen to and hit Enter. For
a list of SHOUTcast servers (and for more information), visit
<a href="../../../../../../www.shoutcast.com/">http://www.shoutcast.com</a>.
SHOUTcast is free for download for general non-profit use. For
commercial use, there is a one-time licensing fee of $299 (as of this
writing).

<h3 class="sect2">24.5.3. Apple QuickTime Audio (.mov)</h3>

<p>Although <a name="INDEX-2626" />
<a name="INDEX-2627" />QuickTime is
best known as a video technology, it is also possible to create
audio-only QuickTime Movies (<em class="filename">.mov</em>). QuickTime is
a container format, meaning it can contain a wide variety of media.
In fact, the QuickTime 5 format can store still images (JPEG, BMP,
PICT, PNG, and GIF), a number of movie formats including MPEG-1,
360-degree panoramic images, Flash movies, MP3 audio, and other audio
formats. Once you package up media in a QuickTime
.<em class="filename">mov</em> file, you can take advantage of QuickTime
features such as dependable cross-platform performance, excellent
compression, and true streaming.
</p>

<p>Although the QuickTime system extension is needed to play a
<em class="filename">.mov</em> file, it is widely distributed and
available for both Windows and Macintosh systems. In addition, recent
versions of both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer come with
the QuickTime plug-in, so a QuickTime audio player can be embedded
right on the page. It is a reliable format since you can assume most
users have the appropriate plug-in or player.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">24.5.4. MIDI (.mid)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-2628" />MIDI
(which stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a
different breed of audio file format. It was originally developed as
a standard way for electronic musical instruments to communicate with
each other.
</p>

<p>A MIDI file contains no actual audio information (the digital
representation of analog sound), but rather numeric commands that
trigger a series of notes (with instructions on each note's
length and volume). These notes are played by a MIDI player using the
available "instrument" sounds on a computer's sound
card. The function is similar to the way a player piano roll creates
a song when run through on the player piano.
</p>

<p>As a result, MIDI files are incredibly compact and ideal for
low-bandwidth delivery. They are capable of packing a minute of music
into just 10K, which is 1,000 times smaller than a one-minute WAV
file (approximately 10 MB).
</p>

<p>QuickTime and most other MIDI file handlers install a General MIDI
(GM) soundset with instruments like piano, drums, bass, orchestral
strings, and even vocal "oohs" and "aahs" in
standardized MIDI locations. While these sounds may vary in quality
and timbre from player to player, General MIDI files can depend on
getting a piano sound when they send to Program 1, Channel 1 of the
GM Player (built into QuickTime, etc.). These sound sets can be
surprisingly good, but they still can't compete with recordings
created in a studio. In general, MIDI files will always sound
"computery."
</p>

<p>Despite this limitation, MIDIs are an extremely attractive
alternative for adding instrumental music to your web site with very
little download time.
</p>

<p>The following summarizes the MIDI format:</p>

<h3 class="sect2">24.5.5. RealMedia/RealAudio (.rm, .ra)</h3>

<p>RealNetworks (once Progressive Networks) was a pioneer in producing a
viable technology for bringing streaming audio to the Web. Despite
heavy competition, it continues to lead the pack in terms of
widespread use and popularity, and it has grown to be the standard
for streaming audio, including live broadcasts.
</p>

<p>RealAudio is a server-based streaming audio solution. The RealServer
offers advanced features for streaming audio delivery, including
bandwidth negotiation (the proper bit rate version is delivered based
on the speed of the connection), RTSP transmission for smooth
playback, and administrative tools for tracking usage and minimizing
server load. Using the SureStream feature, the bandwidth can be
adjusted on the fly (while the file is streaming) to accommodate bit
rate fluctuations.
</p>

<p>A robust RealServer system can allow thousands of simultaneous
listeners. The server software requires a large investment (starting
at around $2000 for the basic package), and RealNetworks charges
licensing fees for the number of streams. There is, however, a free
version that allows 25 simultaneous listeners. For more information,
see the RealNetworks site at <a href="../../../../../../www.realnetworks.com/">http://www.realnetworks.com</a>.
</p>

<p>If you aren't ready to commit to a RealServer, RealMedia and
RealAudio files can be pseudo-streamed from an ordinary HTTP server
for sites with a limited amount of traffic.
</p>

<p>To listen to RealAudio files, users must have RealPlayer, which is
available for Windows, Mac, and Unix systems. The RealPlayer plug-in
comes installed with Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer and
makes it possible to embed a RealMedia player right in the web page.
</p>

<p>RealNetworks also offers tools for creating RealAudio and RealMedia
files. The latest version (as of this writing) is RealSystem Producer
Plus, which provides complete tools for converting audio and video to
streaming format. Earlier creation tools include RealEncoder, for
simple conversions, and RealPublisher, with advanced features such as
wizards for creating HTML and FTP support. Audio can be saved in
either the current and preferred RealMedia format
(<em class="filename">.rm</em>) or the RealAudio format
(<em class="filename">.ra</em>) for support in older versions of
RealPlayer (5 and earlier).
</p>

<p>The process for adding RealAudio to a web page is covered in detail
later in this chapter. For more information, visit the RealNetworks
site at <a href="../../../../../../www.realnetworks.com/">http://www.realnetworks.com</a>. For

<h3 class="sect2">24.5.6. Windows Media (.wma, .asf)</h3>

<p>Microsoft's Windows Media is a streaming media system similar
to RealMedia. Like RealMedia, it comes with the standard components
for creating, playing, and serving Windows Media files. Windows Media
wraps all media elements into one Active Streaming File
(<em class="filename">.asf</em> ), Microsoft's proprietary streaming
media format. Audio may also be saved as nonstreaming Windows Media
Audio format (<em class="filename">.wma</em>). Because Media Player is
part of the Windows operating system, it is widely distributed and
stable on the Windows platform. A considerably less supported version
of Media Player is available for the Mac as well.
</p>

<p>Windows Media Audio files are encoded using the special Windows Media
Audio codec (currently in Version 8) which is ideal for all types of
audio at bit rates from 16 Kbps to 192 Kbps. Users must have the
Version 8 player to hear audio encoded with the Version 8 codec, so
use Version 7 if you don't wish to force your users to upgrade.
For voice-only audio at low bit rates (8 Kbps), use the alternative
ACELP codec.
</p>

<p>The Windows Media system has its advantages and disadvantages. On the
good side, the server software comes free with Windows NT Server 4.0
and later, and there are no charges for streams as there is with
RealMedia. Administration tools make it easy to track performance and
bill per view or per minute. The disadvantages to Windows Media are
that the server only runs on Windows NT and it doesn't support
Flash or SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) like
RealMedia. Also, although there is a Windows Media Player for the
Mac, it lags behind the Windows version in terms of features and
performance, so Mac users may miss your content.
</p>

<p>For more information on Windows Media, see <a href="../../../../../../www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/en/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/en/default.asp</a>.

<h3 class="sect2">24.5.8. Flash (.swf) and Shockwave (.dcr)</h3>

<p>If you want to add short interactive sound effects to a page, such as
button rollover noises, consider using a <a name="INDEX-2631" />
<a name="INDEX-2632" />Flash
movie (<em class="filename">.swf</em> ). Flash, developed by Macromedia,
is an ideal format for adding high-impact interactivity and animation
to web sites. Audio (from short clips to long-playing audio) can be
embedded in a Flash movie and triggered instantly by user actions.
With other file formats (particularly streaming audio), there is an
inevitable delay between the request and playback, making it
inappropriate for interactive presentations.
</p>

<p>Macromedia also offers <a name="INDEX-2633" /> <a name="INDEX-2634" />
<a name="INDEX-2635" />Shockwave
for putting CD-ROM-like interactive media files on web pages.
Shockwave takes Director files (which can take advantage of the
robust Lingo scripting language for advanced functionality) and
compresses them down for web delivery as <em class="filename">.dcr</em>
files. Shockwave files may contain internal sound effects and
streaming audio in the Shockwave Audio (SWA) format. Despite
compression, Shockwave files are not well suited for low-bandwidth
connections.

<p><a name="INDEX-2636" /> <a name="INDEX-2637" />
<a name="INDEX-2638" />Beatnik's Rich Music Format (RMF) is
an HTML-based format that uses scripting languages (like JavaScript)
to synchronize interactive soundtracks. RMF uses an advanced
collection of MIDI sounds (some proprietary) combined with
user-configured samples. The result is excellent sound quality in
extremely small files that download fast. Beatnik is another option
for adding interactive (user-triggered) sound effects to a web page.
</p>

<p>One of Beatnik's claims to fame (besides being co-founded by
pop legend Thomas Dolby Robertson) is its Mixman eMix remixers. By
clicking on different buttons, users can remix popular songs and send
their creations to their friends. For more information, go to
<a href="../../../../../../www.mixman.com/">http://www.mixman.com</a>.
</p>

<p>The Beatnik system is comprised of Beatnik Player (the browser
plug-in required for playing <em class="filename">.rmf</em> files),
Beatnik Audio Engine (a software audio mixer), Beatnik Methodizer (an
automated JavaScript generator for adding Beatnik to web pages), and
Beatnik Editor (for creating customized digital audio samples). The
learning curve is fairly steep, and you must know some JavaScript to
get the most out of the system.
</p>

<p>Beatnik's disadvantages are its reliance on the Beatnik Player
plug-in, which users must download, and the complexity of its
authoring environment. It is also not well suited for long-format
audio files. But for short, interactive sound effects, Beatnik offers
a big bang for a few bytes. For more information, see the<a name="INDEX-2639" /> Beatnik web site at
<a href="../../../../../../www.beatnik.com/">http://www.beatnik.com</a>.
