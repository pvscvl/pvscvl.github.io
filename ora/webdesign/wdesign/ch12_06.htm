<h2 class="sect1">12.6. Java Applets</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-1251" /> <a name="INDEX-1252" /> <a name="INDEX-1253" /> <a name="INDEX-1254" /> <a name="INDEX-1255" />Java is an
object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems
(<a href="../../../../../../www.sun.com/">http://www.sun.com</a>). It should
be noted that it is not related to JavaScript, which is a scripting
language developed by Netscape Navigator to run within an HTML
document in a browser. Because Java is a full programming language
(like C or C++), it can be used to create whole applications.
</p>

<p>Java's primary contribution to the Web, however, has been in
the form of Java<em class="firstterm"> applets</em>, which are
self-contained, mini-executable programs. These programs, named with
the <em class="filename">.class</em> suffix, can be placed right on the
web page, like a graphic.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-12-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.6.1. Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>

<p>Applets are ideal for web distribution for the following reasons:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>They are platform-independent.</p>
</li><li>
<p>They download completely and run on the client, so there is no
continued burden on the server.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Applet files are generally quite compact and download quickly.</p>
</li><li>
<p>They don't require a proprietary plug-in to be installed. All
the major browsers are now Java-enabled, which means chances are good
that users will be able to view the applet.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Of course, every utopian technology has its darker side, and
unfortunately, in the real world, browsers can be temperamental in
the way they handle Java applets. Browsers are notorious for crashing
in the presence of a computation-hungry applet. In general, it also
takes browsers a long time to initialize Java, which tends to chase
users away. There was a great buzz among web developers when Java
applets first hit the scene, but since then enthusiasm has waned in
the face of performance issues and the development of other web
multimedia solutions.

<h3 class="sect2">12.6.2. What Applets Can Do</h3>

<p>What <em class="emphasis">can't</em> applets do?! Java applets are
used for everything from simple animations to flight simulators.
Because Java allows for computations on-the-fly, they are useful for
programs that interact with user input. Not surprisingly, a large
percentage of Java applets are games, but applets are also used for
more practical purposes, such as calculators and spreadsheets. More
interestingly, they can serve live data (news headlines, stock
quotes, sports scores, etc.) and let users navigate through complex
data relationships.
</p>

<p>There are probably thousands of Java applets out there. The following
is just a smattering of the types of things they can do:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Utilities -- calculators, calendars, clocks, spreadsheets</p>
</li><li>
<p>Text effects -- scrolling marquees, wiggling text, flashing
colored text messages
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Audio effects -- digital "guitars," radio buttons</p>
</li><li>
<p>Games -- Asteroids, crosswords, Hangman, Minesweeper</p>
</li><li>
<p>Miscellaneous -- biorhythm charts, flight simulators, daily quotes</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 class="sect2">12.6.3. Where to Get Applets</h3>

<p>If you need a customized applet for your site, your best bet is to
hire a programmer to create one to your specifications. However,
there are a number of applets available for free or for a licensing
fee that you can download from libraries on the Web.
</p>

<p>A good place to start is the applets section of Sun's Java site
at <a href="../../../../../../java.sun.com/applets/">http://java.sun.com/applets/</a>.
This page provides a list of links to applet-related resources.
</p>

<p>If you are looking for cool applets you can use right away, try the
JavaBoutique at <a href="../../../../../../javaboutique.internet.com/">http://javaboutique.internet.com</a>. Here you
will find hundreds of applets available for download as well as clear
instructions for their use. It's a great way to add
interactivity to your site without learning any programming.
</p>

</div>
<a name="wdnut2-CHP-12-SECT-6.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">12.6.4. Downloading and Using Java Applets</h3>

<p>In addition to these, there are a number of small businesses with
Java applet packages for sale or available for a nominal licensing
fee. Because the list is constantly changing, I recommend doing a
search for "Java Applets" on Yahoo (<a href="../../../../../../www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com</a>) or your favorite search
engine.
</p>

<p>It is fairly easy to download an applet and add it to a web page. The
steps below follow the instructions provided by the JavaBoutique for
downloading applets from their site, but they can be used for applets
from any resource.
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Download the <em class="filename">.class</em><a name="INDEX-1256" /> file along
with any associated image or audio files. (Note that there is a bug
in Navigator 4.0 that requires you to hold the Shift key before
clicking the link for the <em class="filename">.class</em> file.) In some
cases, you may be given the raw Java code, in which case you need to
compile it using Sun's Java Developer Kit.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <em class="filename">.class</em> file should be saved in the same
directory as the HTML file, unless otherwise noted by the
<tt class="literal">codebase</tt> attribute in the associated
<tt class="literal">&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag (this attribute gives the path
for the applet). If the applet requires additional resources (such as
image or audio files), be sure to save them in the same directory
structure you found them (or follow the directions provided with the
applet).
</p>
</li><li>
<p>When getting an applet from a library such as JavaBoutique, the
required HTML source is made available with the download, so you can
just copy and paste it into your HTML document and adjust the
parameters as necessary.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Test the applet in a browser or applet viewer. Because applets run
client-side, you don't need a server to do your testing. Most
problems with applets are due to elements not being in the right
places. Make sure that your <em class="filename">.class</em> file is in
the directory noted by the <tt class="literal">codebase</tt> attribute or
in the same directory as the HTML file if no
<tt class="literal">codebase</tt> is specified. Also be sure that your
supporting resource files are in their correct directories and that
everything is named correctly (remember that names in Java code are
case-sensitive). Troubles may arise in setting all the parameters
correctly, but these problems cannot be anticipated and need to be
solved on a per-applet basis.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Last but not least, it is good form to credit the author of the
applet as well as the online resource. The JavaBoutique provides a
discreet logo you can place on the page with the applet.

<h3 class="sect2">12.6.5. Adding an Applet to a Page</h3>

<p>There are currently two methods for adding an applet to a web page:
the <tt class="literal">&lt;object&gt;</tt> tag, recommended by HTML 4.01,
and the better-supported <tt class="literal">&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag.
</p>

<p>The W3C has deprecated the <tt class="literal">&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag and
all its attributes in favor of the <tt class="literal">&lt;object&gt;</tt>
tag. Despite this, the &lt;applet&gt; tag may still be the better
choice, because browser support for
<tt class="literal">&lt;object&gt;</tt>-embedded applets is so inconsistent
that it is difficult to find an approach that works in all browsers.
In addition, some applets require that the
<tt class="literal">&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag be used, so read the
documentation for the applet first. This section looks at both
methods.
</p>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-12-SECT-6.5.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.6.5.1. Adding applets with &lt;object&gt;</h3>

<p>You can add a simple, self-contained applet to an HTML document using
the <tt class="literal">&lt;object&gt;</tt> tag like this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;OBJECT CLASSID="applet.class" CODEBASE="http://somedomain.com/classes/"&gt;
An applet with some useful function should display in this space.
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">classid</tt> attribute points to the applet itself
(its implementation). It has the same function as the
<tt class="literal">code</tt> attribute in the
<tt class="literal">&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag when used for Java applets.
<tt class="literal">classid</tt> may not contain any pathname information,
so the location of the class file is provided by the
<tt class="literal">codebase</tt> attribute.
</p>

<p>When using <tt class="literal">&lt;object&gt;</tt> for Java applets, the
object tag may contain a number of parameter
(<tt class="literal">&lt;param&gt;</tt>) tags, as with the
<tt class="literal">&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag. (Note that Netscape 4.0 does
not support <tt class="literal">&lt;param&gt;</tt> tags within the
<tt class="literal">&lt;object&gt;</tt> tag, so it may not play applets
correctly if placed this way.)
</p>

<p>The following is an example of an applet with additional parameters:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;OBJECT CLASSID="applet.class" CODEBASE="http://somedomain.com/classes/"&gt;
  &lt;PARAM NAME="param1" VALUE="value1"&gt;
  &lt;PARAM NAME="param2" VALUE="value2"&gt;
  &lt;PARAM NAME="param3" VALUE="value3"&gt;
An applet with some useful function should display in this space.
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;</pre></blockquote>

</div>

<a name="wdnut2-CHP-12-SECT-6.5.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.6.5.2. Adding applets with &lt;applet&gt;</h3>

<p>The <tt class="literal">&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag is a container for any
number of parameter (<tt class="literal">&lt;param&gt;</tt>)
<a name="INDEX-1257" /> <a name="INDEX-1258" /> <a name="INDEX-1259" />
<a name="INDEX-1260" /> <a name="INDEX-1261" />
<a name="INDEX-1262" />tags. The following is an example
of how an <tt class="literal">&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag for a game might
look:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;APPLET CODEBASE=class CODE="Wacky.class" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=400&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME="Delay" VALUE="250"&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME="Time" VALUE="120"&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME="PlaySounds" VALUE="YES"&gt;
&lt;/APPLET&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The opening applet tag contains a number of standard attributes:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">code</tt><a name="INDEX-1263" /></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Tells the browser which applet will be used. Applets end with the
suffix <em class="filename">.class</em> or <em class="filename">.jar</em>. This
attribute is required.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">codebase</tt><a name="INDEX-1264" /></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>This tells the browser in which directory to find the applets. If the
applets are in the same directory as the page, the
<tt class="literal">codebase</tt> attribute is not necessary.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt class="literal">width</tt>, <tt class="literal">height</tt><a name="INDEX-1265" />
<a name="INDEX-1266" />
<a name="INDEX-1267" /></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>These specify the pixel dimensions of the "window" the
applet will occupy. These attributes are required for the Java applet
to function properly.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The <tt class="literal">&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag can also take many of the
same attributes used for images, such as
<tt class="literal">alt</tt><a name="INDEX-1268" />
<a name="INDEX-1269" />
<a name="INDEX-1270" />
<a name="INDEX-1271" /> (for
providing alternative text if the applet can not be displayed),
<tt class="literal">align</tt> (for positioning the applet in the flow of
text), and <tt class="literal">hspace/vspace</tt> (used in conjunction with
<tt class="literal">align</tt>).
</p>

<p>Special parameters for the applet are provided by any number of
parameter tags (sometimes there are none). The
<tt class="literal">&lt;param&gt;</tt> tag always contains the
<a name="INDEX-1272" />
<a name="INDEX-1273" />name of the
parameter (<tt class="literal">name=</tt>) and its value
(<tt class="literal">value=</tt>). Parameters provide special settings and
controls that are specific to the particular applet, so you need to
follow the parameter coding instructions provided by the programmer
of the<a name="INDEX-1274" />
<a name="INDEX-1275" />
<a name="INDEX-1276" />
<a name="INDEX-1277" /> applet.
</p>
