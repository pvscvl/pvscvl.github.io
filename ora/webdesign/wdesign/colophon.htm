<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>








<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>

<p>The animal appearing on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Web Design in a Nutshell</em> is
a least weasel (<em class="emphasis">Mustela nivalis</em>). There are 67 species of weasel,
including the mink, ermine, ferret, otter, and skunk. Weasels, who are
characterized by long, slender bodies and short legs, are found on all
continents except Antarctica and Australia, and in a vast variety of
habitats.</p>

<p>The least weasel is the smallest of the 67 species of
weasel. Weighing in at approximately two ounces and measuring less
than ten inches long, the least weasel is the smallest carnivore on
Earth. They are found throughout the world, in northern climates. In
warm weather this weasel's coat is brown, with a white underside. In
winter it turns completely white. Thanks to its camouflage abilities
and its speed and agility, the least weasel is rarely caught.</p>

<p>The diet of the least weasel is made up primarily of voles and
mice, which, because of the weasels' high metabolism, they hunt
constantly. One family of these little weasels can consume thousands
of rodents each year, making them important in controlling pest
populations. Because it is so small, the least weasel can follow mice
into their burrows and eat them there. Like other weasels, they will
occasionally then make their victim's home their own, lining it with
the fur of the former resident when preparing to nest. Least weasels
can produce two litters a year, with three to five young per
litter. </p>


<p>Emily Quill was the production editor, and Leanne Soylemez was
the copyeditor for <em class="citetitle">Web Design in a Nutshell, Second Edition</em>. Ellie
Cutler and Jane Ellin provided quality control. Joe Wizda wrote the
index.</p>

 
<p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using an original
illustration by Lorrie LeJeune. Emma Colby produced the cover layout
with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond font.</p>

 
<p>Melanie Wang designed the interior layout based on a series design by Nancy Priest. Anne-Marie Vaduva implemented the design in FrameMaker 5.5.6 using tools created by Mike Sierra. The text and heading fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book. The illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano and Jessamyn Read using Macromedia FreeHand 9 and Adobe Photoshop 6. This colophon was written by Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary.</p>
