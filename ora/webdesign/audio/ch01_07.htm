<h2 class="sect1">1.7. Designing web audio</h2>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-66" />
<a name="INDEX-67" />best way
to start designing web sound is to ask some basic questions. Once
you've formulated your answers, you can make some concrete
decisions about which tools to use to solve problems and meet project
goals. Here are three things to consider in planning your sound
design:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Overall site
purpose</b><a name="INDEX-68" />. Determine the purpose of your
site. Will this site provide news, entertainment, or both? If you are
selling a product, what's the best approach: a demo or a
tutorial? RealNetworks, Macromedia, and other companies selling
technology or software often have galleries that show off how
customers have used their products creatively. But the galleries do
more than showcase the products; they build a community of users, who
are also the company's customer base.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Target audience</b>.
<a name="INDEX-69" /> <a name="INDEX-70" />Determine your target audience. Who will
be using your site? This may influence the types of sounds or music
you use. For example, extreme sports advocates may be looking for a
different web experience than someone seeking health care
information. Determine how much time your audience spends on a given
page. Getting an average can help you decide the length of your
streamed sound files. How will they be using your site? Intense
gamers may be bent on immersing themselves in a site while news
hounds might want to just grab headlines and move on.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Bandwidth limitations</b>.
<a name="INDEX-71" />Determine
your limitations before you begin the sound design process. What
types of delivery machine and platform are typically used by your
target audience? Working with bandwidth limitations requires a
thorough understanding of your output medium and target platform.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>In addition, answering these general questions before you start will
help you avoid future problems:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Will the web site audience have either slow analog modems or faster
DSL, cable, or T1 connections?
</p>
</li><li>
<p>How much will you need to compress your audio to meet the bandwidth
target?
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Which is more important to your audience: higher quality sound files
or shorter download times?
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>To hear the quality of your final sound design, test the delivery
machine or platform that represents the lowest common denominator.
Make sure your audio sounds good over the Web and not just on your
studio monitors. It is always more costly to change your soundtrack
or fix mistakes at the end of the project. Don't get caught
having to tell the producers that the great audio they have been
hearing will not work in the final product.
</p>

<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td><h4 class="objtitle">Always save high-quality masters</h4>
<p>Capturing the highest-quality source audio will improve the final output quality of your web audio, even for 8-bit sound over slow modem speeds. If you're preparing audio for low-bandwidth formats, remember to save your high-quality 44.1 kHz, 16-bit original master copies. Then when bandwidth over the Internet increases, you can re-process your original audio with the higher quality formats. </p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>Three types <a name="INDEX-72" />of sound can be incorporated into a web
site:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Narration</b>.<a name="INDEX-73" />
In the form of speech, interviews, voice annotations, dialogue, and
newscasts, narration can be used as informative rich content.
Narration as an accompaniment to text and graphics is also a great
way to enrich your web content with more in-depth information.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Sound effects</b>.
<a name="INDEX-74" />Interactive
sound effects triggered by user actions, such as button rollovers or
transition sounds, can enhance site navigation and make your content
more engaging and responsive to user input. Sound effects are also
commonly referred to as foley sounds (see <a href="ch01_07.htm">the sidebar "What is foley?"</a> later in this chapter).
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Music</b>. Music in the form of ambient
loops or long-playing streaming media clips can add life and
emotional impact to your entertainment content and presentations.
<a name="INDEX-75" />
<a name="INDEX-76" /><em class="emphasis">Ambient loops</em> are
short background music or audio clips that repeat, or
"loop." Short sound loops are the most commonly used
method for adding music to a web page in low-bandwidth conditions. A
good loop downloads fast and creates the illusion of continuous music
playing in the background.
</p>
</li></ul>
<a name="sound-CHP-1-SECT-7.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.7.1. Easy-to-use narration</h3>

<p>Narration is <a name="INDEX-77" />
<a name="INDEX-78" />
<a name="INDEX-79" />one
of the most popular applications of web audio because it is
straightforward, easy to use, and provides a dynamic source of
information and entertainment for your audience. Visitors can click
on a button and listen to audio while they continue to read the rest
of the web page. A small link to a streaming narration audio file can
be unobtrusively placed to the side of a text column or below a
picture caption. <a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-1</a> illustrates how a
popular news site uses narration to enhance its text content. If
users do not have the appropriate plug-in or do not wish to listen to
audio, they can easily scroll past the audio link without disrupting
their viewing experience. You can also offer a simple HTML page slide
show with narration, graphics, and
<a name="INDEX-80" />text.
</p>

<h4 class="objtitle">Five web sound design mistakes to avoid</h4>
&nbsp;
<ul><li>
<p><em class="emphasis">Embedding sounds on the first page of your web site with bad
scripting that causes browsers to crash.</em> If you use audio on your
home page, make <a name="INDEX-81" />sure the scripting is cross-platform.
Beta-test the page thoroughly on several different systems and
browsers or do not use audio on the first page.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p><em class="emphasis">Using abrasive, distracting button sounds that draw attention away
from important content.</em> Button sounds make your site easier and more
fun to navigate. Do not <a name="INDEX-82" />spoil the effect with loud obtrusive
sound effects. Button sounds are triggered frequently and should be
understated. A dramatic note will sound good the first time but not
the second, third, and fourth time. If you saw Stanley
Kubrick's last movie, Eyes Wide Shut, you'll remember
that single piano note played repeatedly throughout the film. It
offers a good example of an effective dramatic note that was overused
to the point of annoyance.<a name="INDEX-83" />
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p><em class="emphasis">Creating loops that are monotonous.</em> Unless you have a truly great
groove, short loops can be annoying and aggravating. Make sure
to<a name="INDEX-84" /> select audio that does not offend
the tastes of your target audience.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p><em class="emphasis">Using audio incessantly without silence or pauses.</em> If you use loops, give people's ears a
rest every few pages. For instance, leave audio off the home page or
fade your loops out after 15 or 30 seconds of playback. Give visitors
a break from the soundtrack every time they come back to the home
page. In Flash, you can specify the exact number of times a sound
file loops and the rate at which it fades out.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p><em class="emphasis">Using low-quality audio with inconsistent volume.</em>
<a name="INDEX-85" />Avoid
poor source material recorded in noisy locations with less than
optimal equipment. If you use narration, hire a good voice-over
artist to read your content. Set consistent volume levels for all the
narration on your web site.
</p>
</li></ul></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>The downside to using narration in the form of real-time streaming
audio is that it may require dedicated servers, special software, and
user licenses. As opposed to short sound effects and music loops that
download in a few seconds then quickly play back, narration or voice
clips are much longer in length and need to be broadcast in real
time. Streaming to large audiences of several hundred or thousands of
listeners simultaneously requires intensive bandwidth and
infrastructure. If you are broadcasting to only a few hundred
listeners per day, you can get away with much simpler and
cost-effective solutions. For example, RealAudio's Basic
RealServer will run on the same web server that serves up your web
pages. See <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Encoding, Serving, and Streaming Sound with RealAudio"</a> for more information.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-1-SECT-7.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.7.1.1. Capturing narration</h3>

<p>Unlike ambient loops<a name="INDEX-86" />
<a name="INDEX-87" /> and sound effects,
capturing high-quality narration is more a matter of practicing good
general recording and editing techniques than of using special fade
effects or seamless looping tricks (for more about recording, see
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Capturing Original Source Material"</a>; for more about editing, see <a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "Optimizing Your Sound Files"</a>).
<a name="INDEX-88" />The
quality of streaming audio is determined by two factors: the
condition of the source audio prior to encoding, and the compression
format or encoding scheme used to encode your audio files for web
delivery. If you start with low-quality audio source material, you
will get poor results regardless of the speed of the users'
modems or the compression format. As a web developer, you may not be
able to discern your potential audience's bandwidth
capabilities, but you can ensure that your audio source material is
set to the proper volume level and is free of distortion and
background system noise.
</p>

<p>As we'll explain in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Introduction to Streaming Media"</a>, the amount
and form of compression used to encode your source audio greatly
effects the quality of the end sound. In contrast to text, audio eats
up enormous amounts of bandwidth. A one-minute sound file can easily
exceed the amount of digital information needed to reproduce an
entire novel. In order to reduce the file size and bandwidth
requirements of your audio files,
<a name="INDEX-89" />
<a name="INDEX-90" />encoding schemes and
compression formats
<a name="INDEX-91" />discard
small pieces of digital information that represent the sound. As you
might expect, this process degrades the sound quality. The amount of
degradation is equivalent to how small you need to make the sound
file to fit your bandwidth constraints. Some audio formats such as
MP3
<a name="INDEX-92" />
<a name="INDEX-93" />
<a name="INDEX-94" />do
a better job at compression than other formats such as AIFF or
RealMedia's original audio compression scheme.

<h4 class="objtitle">What is foley?</h4>
<p>Foley is the art of providing audio realism to visuals in post production. The Foley technique is named for Jack Foley, a sound editor at Universal Studios, who was one of the first film artists in the early 1950s to specialize in the new field of adding audio to silent film reels (<a href="../../../../../../www.marblehead.net/foley/jack.html">http://www.marblehead.net/foley/jack.html</a>). Foley sounds are often the first sounds added to a film soundtrack and generally include footsteps, sounds of the actors clothing, and prop movements on the screen such as a closing door or an object falling to the floor. Foley artists perform in a recording room, making sounds and noises with various objects to simulate the sounds of the action on screen. A classic example of a favorite foley technique is to hit a plump cabbage in front of a microphone to simulate the sound of a fistfight.</p>

<a name="INDEX-95" />stream narration: RealAudio,

<a name="INDEX-98" />
<a name="INDEX-99" />

<a name="INDEX-101" /><a name="INDEX-102" />Windows
Media, QuickTime 4, MP3, and Flash. RealAudio is the most popular and
well-tested system for streaming audio. If you are embedding audio on
a large web site with hundreds or thousands of visitors per day and
need technical support, use the RealAudio system with a dedicated
RealServer. If you are more daring or have more technical skills, you
can deploy an MP3 server. Most popular audio players and plug-ins
such as RealAudio, Windows Media, and Flash play back MP3 files.
</p>

<p>HTTP pseudo-streaming with RealAudio, Flash, or Shockwave is a viable
alternative for those who do not have administrative access to a web
server. It is best suited for web sites with low traffic volume or
for cutting-edge sites that have an audience willing to download the
plug-in or look past the occasional audio drop-out error message. The
Shockwave audio player is customizable and easy to embed directly in
a web page.

<h3 class="sect2">1.7.2. Using sound effects</h3>

<p>Sound effects <a name="INDEX-106" />
<a name="INDEX-107" /> <a name="INDEX-108" />are generally short, interface-oriented
audio clips triggered by user action. Button sounds make it easier
for people to navigate your web site. An audio cue, in addition to a
graphic button, adds another sensory dimension to your web page.
</p>

<p>Sound effects can also be used as short audio clips synchronized with
animation. An animated intro screen or home page with audio pulls
people into your site. Sound effects are a great way to engage your
audience and get them interested in your site's content.
</p>

<p>Sound effects should be relatively short in length so they can
download and play back quickly. Lengthier sounds take too long to
download and should be incorporated into a site as a streaming
narration or a music file. <a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-2</a> shows a
typical button sound just over a second in length. Notice the quick
fade-in and immediate rapid decay.

<h4 class="objtitle">The color of sound</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>Walter Murch, <a name="INDEX-109" />the father of modern sound design and the
creator of the soundtracks for such legendary films as <em class="emphasis">The
Godfather</em> and <em class="emphasis">Apocalypse Now</em>,
describes the basic components of sound design, the term he
originated in the early 1970s.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>"Sound <a name="INDEX-110" />is analogous
to light and the color spectrum of a rainbow," says Murch.
"At one end of a rainbow you have violet and at the other end
you have red. At the violet end you have sounds that convey a high
degree of information such as speech and dialog. At the opposite end
you have infrared sound such as music, which has little code,
language, or specific meaning, but tons of emotion and an unrivaled
ability to communicate mood to the audience."
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>However, Walter points out that "in the real world, sounds
rarely ever fall clearly into one category or the other. There are
elements of language that work their way into music, and by the same
token, there are elements of music that work their way into the
cadence of the spoken word. In between the two is this rather vague
middle area of pure sound: it's not dialogue or speech any
more, nor is it really music. This middle area that comprises the
vast majority of film sound is known as sound effects and
foley." So when it comes to web audio, don't limit
yourself to simple narration and background music. Get more creative
and use sound effects to add another layer of richness to your
interactive web content.

The volume peaks of both the intro and button sounds have been
normalized or raised to reach just below the maximum volume level. By

<p>Background audio loops convey emotion and create mood, and they are
most effective when they do not overpower the text and graphics on
your web site.
</p>

<p>A good loop sounds as if it were being randomly generated over time
instead of repeating over and over. The trick to making a good
background loop is to recreate the same auditory experience someone
would have walking in the forest or along the ocean or listening to a
music recording. This effect, also called <em class="emphasis">sonic
realism</em>, <a name="INDEX-124" /> <a name="INDEX-125" />is
difficult to achieve in limited-bandwidth environments using two- to
four-second loops. Sonic realism is much easier to achieve in a
high-bandwidth environment with six- to thirteen-second loops. Three
factors that help build this sense of realism are good mixing,
optimum loop length, and seamless loops.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-1-SECT-7.3.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.7.3.1. Sound loops versus repetitive sound effects</h3>

<p>Sonic realism is <a name="INDEX-126" />
<a name="INDEX-127" />achieved when there are no perceptible
gaps or noticeable "pops" when the loop repeats or when
the two endpoints meet. An ambient sound loop is different from a
repetitive <a name="INDEX-128" /> <a name="INDEX-129" />sound effect. A repetitive sound effect is
a sound with fade-ins and fade-outs and gaps of silence between
cycles or loops. A true sound loop is seamless and infinite with no
recognizable start or endpoint
</p>

<p>In some cases, it may be more appropriate to use repeating sound
effects with long gaps of silence rather than ambient loops. This is
due in part to the lack of scripting controls for elegant cross-fades
<a name="INDEX-130" />between sound
loops, and the danger of loops becoming too monotonous. For example,
if someone clicks on a link to a section of your web site that has a
different sound loop, the new loop abruptly cuts in and stops the
previous sound. If you built your web pages entirely within the
framework of a Shockwave movie, you could use
<a name="INDEX-131" />Lingo to script
cross-fades between loops. But if you embedded Shockwave in frames as
we'll discuss later in this section, you cannot use Lingo for
cross-fades. For these reasons, you may decide that in this rare case
a repeating sound effect set to retrigger after a few seconds of
silence creates a better effect than an ambient loop.
</p>

</div>

<a name="sound-CHP-1-SECT-7.3.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">1.7.3.2. Good ambient loop mixing</h3>

<p>One key to good <a name="INDEX-132" />
<a name="INDEX-133" />ambient
loop mixing is to avoid using distinctive sounds that overpower the
other sounds in your mix. Include one sound element that continues
through the entire loop. Build your audio loop in layers starting
with a soft, background ambient music wash, a continuous noise such
as chirping crickets, or an undulating synth drone. Then add subtle,
varied sound effects to the loop such as a bird chirp, drops of
water, long notes rising in pitch, or a short drumbeat.
</p>

<p>Ornamental sounds <a name="INDEX-134" />
<a name="INDEX-135" />should
be used sparingly in your loop, and they should rest just above the
continuous background sound or even faintly below the surface. It is
best to make a sound almost imperceptible rather than overstate it by
making it too loud. The idea with loops is to create a gentle
continuous landscape that does not have jagged peaks or rugged
valleys. Like a chef using spices, audio
mixing<a name="INDEX-136" />
<a name="INDEX-137" /> is an art form
that takes many years to master. The previous techniques are merely
suggestions of approaches you can take to make a good ambient loop.

<h3 class="sect3">1.7.3.3. Optimum loop length</h3><a name="INDEX-138" /><a name="INDEX-139" />

<p>The key to a <a name="INDEX-140" />
<a name="INDEX-141" />successful sound loop is to create the
shortest loop possible that still sounds dynamic and random. If the
loop is too short, you will recognize the start and endpoints, making
the repetition more noticeable. Longer loops allow for greater
intervals between distinctive noises, which creates the illusion of
infinite sound. If you make the loop too long, however, it will
require too much bandwidth.
</p>

<p>In our experience, the optimum loop length is between 10 and 13
seconds, depending on the type of sound you are looping. That length
is just long enough to create the impression that the loop is an

<p>For certain web applications or page-size constraints, you may have
to compromise and make loops shorter than an optimal 13 seconds in
length. In fact, if your target audience is using 33.6 Kbps modems,
you will be limited to two- to four-second sound loops. If you have
to create shorter loops, keep the mix simple by using fewer
ornamental sounds and more synthesizer drone sounds, or incorporate
rhythm, a naturally repetitive sound texture.
</p>

<p>By incorporating a percussion rhythm <a name="INDEX-142" />or short melody in your ambient loops,
you can produce a two- to four-second loop that sounds intentionally
repetitive or musical. If you use music or rhythm, make sure the loop
lines up on the start and endpoints of one complete rhythmic pattern,
as discussed in <a href="ch01_07.htm">Section 1.7.3.5, "Building seamless music loops"</a> later
in this chapter. It is easy to visually spot where loud percussion
hits appear on your waveform-editing screen when you audition your
rhythm track. Locate the first beat, such as from a snare or kick
drum, and the point where it next repeats in the cycle, then select
the area in between the two points to capture a seamless
<a name="INDEX-143" />
<a name="INDEX-144" />rhythm
loop.
</p>

<p>One of the best ways to embed a loop into your web page is to use an
audio file with a transparent
<a name="INDEX-145" />Shockwave movie. (Note that you can use
Flash in the same manner.) Attach the Shockwave file to a frame.
Place the content of your web pages within the frame. Now the loop
will play back continuously across any pages placed within the frame.
</p>

<p>The main advantage to embedding
<a name="INDEX-146" />Shockwave in frames is that if some
visitors do not have the plug-in, they won't receive an error
message; the loop simply will not play. Shockwave lets you set many
of the parameters directly into HTML pages, including the loop mode,
which specifies that a browser keep looping the SWA sound file.
</p>

<p>For an average web site with four main sections containing four
subcategory pages each, create a frame for each main section. Embed
the subcategory pages within a frame. By using four separate frames,
you can play different ambient loops for each section. By using
several loops, you avoid the monotony of having one sound playing
throughout the entire site. To create silence and a break from the
ambient loops in the rest of your site, do not place a loop on the
home page. See <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "Introduction to Streaming Media"</a> for a step-by-step guide
to using Shockwave loops.

<h3 class="sect3">1.7.3.4. Sound loop tutorial: creating seamless loops with a sound editor</h3>

<p>The goal <a name="INDEX-147" /> <a name="INDEX-148" />of producing seamless loops is to
<a name="INDEX-149" />cross-fade the
overlapping endpoints of your audio file so they blend perfectly.
Imagine bending a straight piece of metal into a circle, welding the
ends together, and sanding down the rough edges until it is
impossible to feel the two endpoints in the circle. That's what
we're trying to do with a seamless loop.

<p>Making a sound file loop is easy. Making the loop seamless is not.
Here is a step-by-step walk-through of one of the more popular
methods of creating loops in a standard
<a name="INDEX-150" />multitrack sound editor:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>To make an ambient loop, download the sample file from <a href="../../../../../../www.designingwebaudio.com/">http://www.designingwebaudio.com/</a>,
shown in <a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-5</a>. (If you are making a music
loop or a loop that has a distinctive continuous rhythm, such as an
undulating synth drone or drum beat, quickly review this section and
then proceed to <a href="ch01_07.htm">Section 1.7.3.5, "Building seamless music loops"</a>.)

</li>
<li>
<p>Select approximately two seconds of the last portion of the audio
clip as shown in <a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-6</a>. After you have made
your selection, leave the two-second portion highlighted.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Zoom in close. Hold the Shift key down and modify your selection so
that the left end of the highlighted region starts at a zero point on
the waveform, as shown in Figures <a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-7</a> and
<a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-8</a>. Then your highlighted selection on the
right part of the audio region should simply go to the end of the
sound file. Making your edit point at the zero point is the best way
to avoid pops and glitches at the beginning of your loop. This rule
of thumb pertains to all digital audio editing. With stereo files,
you may have to compromise when trying to locate a zero point on both
tracks.

</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have your selection, cut and paste it to a new track as
shown in <a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-9</a>. Make sure it is placed at the
very beginning of the track.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Set the volume parameters of your cross-fade as shown in <a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-10</a>. On the first track, set the fade-in diagonal
volume points at 0% to 100% volume over the two-second overlapping
portion of the audio clip. On the second track, set the volume points
of the fade-out at 100% to 0% over the portion of the clip. Now
select the top audio clip and listen in loop playback mode as shown
in <a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-11</a>. Often the first cross-fade you set
will need minor adjustment. Play with the volume cross-fades until
you get a smooth transition with no dips or peaks in volume at the
edit points. Note that a "linear" or standard
"X" cross-fade will result in a dip in volume.

</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have made minor adjustments to your loop, bounce the tracks
to disk. Convert the file to your format of choice and you're
ready to upload a professional loop to your web site. You <a name="INDEX-151" />can use this
same technique to produce stereo <a name="INDEX-152" /> <a name="INDEX-153" />audio loops.

<h3 class="sect3">1.7.3.5. Building seamless music loops</h3>

<p>In many <a name="INDEX-154" /> <a name="INDEX-155" />online
projects, bandwidth constraints dictate minimal use of audio. Music
or rhythm loops work great when bandwidth constraints limit you to
short two- to four-second loops instead of the ideal loop length of
about 13 seconds used in higher-bandwidth environments. Generally,
it's very difficult to create good ambient background loops
such as a soundscape of a forest, city, or peaceful synthesizer in
two to four seconds. At that
<a name="INDEX-156" />length, the audio tends to
sound repetitive and monotonous. Music or ambient sounds with
percussion, on the other hand, are naturally repetitive, so they
often work well for short loops. Music styles that work particularly
well are rap, techno, and "world beat." These styles are
repetitive in nature, where the listener expects the music to
"ride" on a rhythmic figure. Music that has a lot of
melodic or harmonic rhythm (like many jazz or classical styles) does
not loop as well because the listener expects the music to develop
into other sounds.
</p>

<p>If you have an audio clip that has a consistent rhythm such as rap, a
percussive instrument, or a pulsing sound, you will need to take
extra precaution to select the right edit point. Music loops or
rhythmic loops are the most challenging to produce because the
component of precise timing adds to the difficulty of making a good
cross-fade.
</p>

<p>A close look at the digital audio waveform can reveal the phrasing or
timing of the music without your having to listen to it. You can
often spot repetition in the waveform, which gives you the best
visual indication of the start and endpoints of a music loop.
Percussion is particularly apparent in a music waveform. For
instance, you can see the amplitude from a sharp spike or snare drum,
as shown in <a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-12</a>. Using the snare drum as a
landmark, follow these steps to select a musical measure:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Scan the audio waveform for a distinct pattern of peaks or spikes
that correspond to percussive rhythm sounds in the audio file such as
a snare drum or kick drum, as shown in <a href="ch01_07.htm">Figure 1-12</a>.
Listen to the sound to determine if it hits on the same beat of each
cycle or measure of music. The idea is to find a one- or two-measure
unit of time that makes musical sense when repeated.

<p>Once you locate the repeating percussive sound in the waveform, make
