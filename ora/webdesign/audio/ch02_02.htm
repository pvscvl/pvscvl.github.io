<h2 class="sect1">2.2. Digital audio demystified</h2>

<p>Sound is converted to <a name="INDEX-223" /> <a name="INDEX-224" />digital information by
means of a circuit that creates a set of numbers corresponding to the
shape of an incoming electrical wave or current. Two sets of binary
values represent <a name="INDEX-225" />digitized waveforms:
<a name="INDEX-226" />sampling rate
and <a name="INDEX-227" />bit-depth. A
<em class="emphasis">sample</em> is the value and position assigned to a
point of an electrical waveform. The number of samples taken per
second is called the <em class="emphasis">sampling rate</em>.
<em class="emphasis">Bit-depth</em> refers to the size of the binary
numbers assigned to describe the dynamic value of each sample.
</p>

<p>Sampling is the most important part of the digitizing process. A
sample is simply a snapshot of a sound at a given point in time. The
sampling rate is a measurement of how many snapshots are taken. To
understand this, think about film. A movie camera takes 24 still
photographs per second. When they are played back at a certain speed
in the theater, the result is almost indistinguishable from reality.
Each frame of film is a sample; 24 frames per second is the sampling
rate. If you were to film at a lower sampling rate, there would be
less information for each second of film. The result would be jerky
motion. If you filmed at an even slower rate, the illusion of motion
would disappear completely; the film would look like a sequence of
still images (which it is).

<h4 class="objtitle">Digital audio encoding standard</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>The sampling rate of 44,100 Hz was deemed sufficient for audio
reproduction by the governing standards committee at the time audio
CD technology was born. Many audio professionals argue that a higher
sampling rate is required to accurately reproduce the full dynamic
range and upper harmonics of sound and are actively pushing to
develop standards that include a sampling rate of 88.4 kHz or 96 kHz.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Just as some audio professionals question the 44,100 Hz
<a name="INDEX-228" />
<a name="INDEX-229" /> <a name="INDEX-230" />sampling rate standard, many have
successfully pushed for audio systems with higher 20- and 24-bit
encoding capabilities. The higher bit-depth audio systems reproduce
more of the subtleties of softer sounds and long decays that are lost
in 16-bit recordings.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Higher sampling rate and bit-depth encoding for basic studio
recording and editing requires enormous storage space and computing
speed in order to process and store the digitized audio. A stereo
16-bit, 44,100 Hz audio file requires the computing of 1,411,200 bits
(1.4 Mbit) per second and 10 MB of storage space for every minute of
recorded audio. A 20-bit, 96 kHz audio file needs more than twice
that bandwidth and disk space and requires the computing of 3.8 Mbit
per second.

compression for streaming web audio.

<p>As with film, it takes a
<a name="INDEX-231" />certain
number of snapshots to realistically capture the reality of an analog
sound. The magic number is generally agreed upon as 44,100 Hz. This
number became the audio standard because it is the lowest rate that
can accurately reproduce the highest frequencies of our audible
hearing range. A 44,100 Hz sampling rate accurately reproduces
frequencies up to and slightly beyond the 20,000 Hz hearing limit.
</p>

<p>What happens when you sample at less than this rate? It's kind
of like scanning a photograph at low resolutions. A 72 pixel-per-inch
scan might be recognizable, but it will be of low-quality;
you'll see the pixels, and the transitions between colors will
be very choppy. If you scan even lower, say 10 ppi, the image will be
unrecognizable, just a series of colored blocks. We can visualize
digital audio the same way. If you place a grid over an analog
waveform, you'll get better reproduction with a fine grid and
worse reproduction with a coarse grid. <a href="ch02_02.htm">Figure 2-11</a>
illustrates this point.

Digital resolution can be visualized by overlaying a waveform on a grid. The finer the grid, the higher the resolution. The fineness of the grid is controllable by the sampling rate and bit-depth.</h4>

<p>Once we've sampled the sound at the optimal rate, we just need
to store it as data. How much space do we take to store that data?
For CD-quality sound, the answer is 16 bits. That's a
measurement of bit-depth. Unfortunately, CD quality isn't
practical for the Web, so we start throwing data out by reducing
bit-depth. By the time we get to 8-bit sound, we've compromised
quality quite a bit, but we've also arrived at some reasonable
file sizes. Optimizing
sound<a name="INDEX-232" /> for the Web is a process of backing
off from optimal sampling rates and bit-depths to arrive at something
of acceptable quality and file size. <a href="ch02_02.htm">Figure 2-12</a>
shows the relationship between these two concepts.
