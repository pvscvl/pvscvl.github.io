<h2 class="sect1">8.3. Playing MP3 files</h2>

<p>Later in this chapter, <a name="INDEX-1070" />we will discuss how to encode, upload,
and broadcast MP3 files, but first let's take a look at two of
the most common playback software applications: Nullsoft's
<a name="INDEX-1071" />Winamp<a href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> for Windows
and <a name="INDEX-1072" />SoundJam for
Mac OS. Both are downloadable shareware or freeware applications with
a familiar, CD player-like interface, and graphic equalizers. The
Winamp interface is shown in <a href="ch08_03.htm">Figure 8-1</a>.
</p><blockquote class="footnote">
<a name="FOOTNOTE-1" /><p>[1]Nullsoft is now owned by AOL.</p> </blockquote>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="349" alt="Figure 8-1" src="figs/aud.0801.gif" width="275" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-1. The Winamp interface is similar to standard CD player interfaces.</h4>

<p>First, you need to download the Winamp
(<a href="../../../../../../www.winamp.com/">http://www.winamp.com</a>) or the SoundJam player
(<a href="../../../../../../www.soundjam.com/">http://www.soundjam.com</a>) and one or more MP3
files from the Internet (see <a href="ch08_08.htm">Section 8.8, "MP3 resources"</a> later in this chapter for a listing of good MP3 sites). Thus
playing your files will be as easy as pulling down File <img height="15" alt="Figure 8.3" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Open
in Word or dragging a file onto an application window.
</p>

<p>Winamp consists of four separate modules: the player interface, a
graphic equalizer, the playlist window, and a mini-browser. The first
time you start Winamp, all four windows are grouped in a neat square,
but you can grab any module and position it anywhere on your screen.
You can also close or minimize the modules with the standard
top-right-corner controls. To play back an MP3 file, just drag it
from the desktop or Explorer into the Winamp window, or tap the L key
to access a Windows file panel. You can also click the Open button on
the Winamp interface. Alternatively, drag any folder containing MP3
files onto Winamp to play all the files in that folder sequentially.
That's all well and good, but to start having real fun, you
need to start working with the playlist window.
</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Winamp tip</h4>
<p>To minimize the amount of real estate Winamp takes on your desktop, double-click in the title bar of any of the Winamp modules. They'll immediately roll up into a thin, horizontal strip showing just enough controls to operate the player. This is known as the "Window Shade" mode.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">8.3.1. Playlists</h3>

<p>One of the most powerful aspects of maintaining a file-based digital
music collection is that you can mix and match tracks at will. If
you've ever made custom cassette tapes, you know how
time-consuming it can be. But because playlists simply reference the
locations of arbitrary tracks scattered around on your machine (or on
the Internet), you can create custom "sets" within your
collection quickly and easily.
</p>

<p>The easiest way to create a playlist in Winamp is to drag and drop
your MP3 files onto the
<a name="INDEX-1073" />Winamp
icon or into the open playlist window. There is no limit to the
number of MP3 files you can add, and you may even drag and drop
entire folders.
</p>

<p>Another alternative is to simply press the L key on your keyboard,
which brings up a Windows file panel (you can also load in a whole
directory, including subdirectories, or a URL from the
Internet -- right-click on the Add button to access these
options). Repeat this step as often as you like, and reorder your
playlist in whatever manner you choose -- either by selecting and
dragging entries up or down in the list or by selecting Sort with a
right-click on the Misc button (you can then sort by title, filename,
or path, or reverse or randomize the list). <a href="ch08_03.htm">Figure 8-2</a> shows a Winamp playlist containing several
songs. Be sure to experiment with each of the buttons at the bottom
of the playlist window; these allow you to add, remove, sort, and
organize your playlist in various ways. Try right-clicking the
buttons for additional options.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img height="118" alt="Figure 8-2" src="figs/aud.0802.gif" width="275" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-2. The Winamp playlist has multiple songs in its queue, ready to play in the order in which they appear in the playlist.</h4>

<p>When you're finished arranging your playlist, save it by
selecting Save Playlist (Ctrl-S) from the List Opts button. If you
want to replay that particular playlist at another time, just choose
Open Playlist (Ctrl-O) from the List Optsbutton, or double-click or drag a playlist file onto the
player or into the list window.
</p>

<p>If you want to save your current playlist to an HTML document for
future reference or to show other people what you're listening
to, right-click the Misc button and select Misc <img height="15" alt="Figure 8.3.1" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Generate HTML
Playlist. A non-linked playlist will be launched in your preferred
browser. To save the list, just pull down File <img height="15" alt="Figure 8.3.1" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Save in your
browser.
</p>

<p>If you accepted all of the default options during Winamp
installation, you can also right-click on MP3 files on the desktop or
in Explorer and choose "Enqueue in Winamp." This adds the
selected track or tracks to the end of the current playlist.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-SECT-3.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.3.2. Basic MP3 player controls</h3>

<p>Now that you have your files queued up, you're ready to play
some music. Most MP3 players feature a standard set of CD-like
controls for start, stop, rewind, fast forward, and so on. <a href="ch08_03.htm">Figure 8-3</a> shows
<a name="INDEX-1074" />Winamp's
set of controls. Right-clicking Winamp's control buttons
reveals additional controls. For example, right-click on the fast
forward or rewind button, and you can move to the next or previous
track, advance or rewind the track five seconds, or jump to the
beginning or end of the playlist. In the main interface, you'll
find displays and controls for total elapsed time, basic spectral
analysis, bitrate, stereo balance, volume, and repeat modes.

<p>Like most heavily evolved software, Winamp has a few "Easter

one might only stumble upon by accident . . . or if one read about
them in a book. Try these:

<a name="sound-CHP-8-SECT-3.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.3.3. Using the equalizer</h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1076" /> <a name="INDEX-1077" />graphic equalizer is similar to other
graphic equalizers you may have used. Each slider represents a
frequency range, from 60 Hz (bass) on the left to 16 kHz (treble) on
the right. The slider's values can be set to -20 dB at the
bottom to +20 dB at the top. The best way to understand the equalizer
may be to think of the bass and treble controls on your home
stereo -- these sliders operate similarly but slice up the
frequency spectrum into much finer cross-sections.
</p>

<p>Since MP3 encoders effectively remove most of the original digital
audio information, many MP3 files may exhibit a "hollow"
or "swishy" sound. It is true that equalizers can help to
boost or cut levels to defeat some of the hollow sound and to allow
for a more personalized listening environment. However, the real
purpose of equalization is to compensate for less than optimal
speaker placement, room dynamics, speakers, and frequency response
from any of your equipment, or in some cases, poor original
recordings. <a name="INDEX-1078" />Equalization
cannot be used to entirely defeat the swishy or warbly effect found
in poorly encoded MP3s.
</p>

<p>Always take care when playing with
<a name="INDEX-1079" />equalizers. Many
novices immediately pump up the bass and high frequencies to get a
brighter, punchier sound. This, however, seldom accomplishes much
beyond creating a sound that's untrue to the original source.
The goal of equalization, and the goal of any audiophile, is to
achieve fidelity, or truthfulness in sound. Just as a brighter light
is not necessarily a better light, a brighter sound is not
necessarily better sound. Approach equalizers with care, and make
small adjustments. Live with your changes for a while and listen to
them carefully. Audiophiles rarely use equalizers except to
compensate for awkward room dynamics or poor speakers and speaker
placement. A popular equalization pattern is shown in <a href="ch08_03.htm">Figure 8-4</a> where both the bass and the treble tones are
boosted slightly to create a more full range of sound for an MP3
file. This curve is sometimes referred to as the
"Fletcher-Munsen" curve and is similar to what you get
when you press the Loudness button on your home stereo. The effect is
to enhance frequencies that aren't easily heard at low volumes.
If you're listening to your MP3s at normal or loud volumes, you
won't need this curve. In any case, experiment with the
equalizer controls, and you'll quickly find your own preferred
settings for different types of music. The equalization curves
you're happy with can be saved for future use by clicking the
Presets button and selecting Save.
</p>

<p>Winamp comes bundled with several preset equalization patterns, from
Classical to Techno. Click on the Preset button at the top right and
choose Load <img height="15" alt="Figure 8.3.3" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Preset from the pop-up menu.

<h3 class="sect2">8.3.4. Skins</h3>

<p>Most MP3 players, including Winamp, <a name="INDEX-1080" />
<a name="INDEX-1081" />allow the user to make
cosmetic and functional enhancements by way of third-party plug-ins
and "skins." <em class="emphasis">Skins</em> are the
equivalent of wallpaper on your PC; they are bitmaps cut to the
dimensions of each component of the MP3 player. Taken together, these
custom bitmaps exactly fit the dimensions of the player, hence the
name "skin." Designing skins for Winamp and other players
is something of a cottage industry with thousands of skins available
from various web sites. Check out
us web sites. Check out
us web sites. Check out
<a href="../../../../../../www.winamp.com/skins">http://www.winamp.com/skins</a> for
starters.<a href="ch08_03.htm">Figure 8-5</a> shows
four examples of skins.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-FIG-5" /><div class="figure"><img height="234" alt="Figure 8-5" src="figs/aud.0805.gif" width="588" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 8-5. Skins featuring Star Wars, Titanic, X-Files, and Star Trek's Enterprise are just some of the endless patterns that you can create for your MP3 player.</h4>

<p>While most popular MP3 players have their own skin format, the Winamp
skin format is by far the most popular. Winamp skins can be used by
non-Winamp players and are not restricted to Windows users. Popular
MP3 players for <a name="INDEX-1082" />BeOS,
Mac OS, and <a name="INDEX-1083" />Linux can
use Winamp skins as well.
</p>

<p>To use alternative skins, download them into the Skins subdirectory
of the Winamp installation directory. To access the skin chooser,
right-click any blank area of the Winamp interface and then choose
Skins <img height="15" alt="Figure 8.3.4" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Skin Browser, or tap Alt-S.You can
even choose to have Winamp select a random skin at startup. If
you're using an older version of Winamp, you need to unzip your
skins in the Skins directory. Later versions will unzip skins on the
fly, saving you the extra step.
</p>

<p>If you use multiple operating systems that can mount Windows
partitions, or multiple players that utilize Winamp skins, you may
want to store the skins in a universal directory such as
<em class="emphasis">c:\data\skins</em>, rather than keeping them under
Winamp's roof.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-SECT-3.4.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.3.4.1. Skin-making tutorial</h3>

<p>Making your own skins to use with Winamp or other compatible MP3
players can be fun and easy. Before you begin, there are two things
you need:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>A graphics and imaging application such as Photoshop or Paint Shop
Pro.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Winamp's skin template. You can download the template after you
join their skin developers group at <a href="../../../../../../www.winamp.com/authentication/join.jhtml">http://www.winamp.com/authentication/join.jhtml</a>. If you'd rather not join,
you can use any existing skin just as easily.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Now follow these basic steps:</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Download and unzip the
<a name="INDEX-1084" />Skin
Template zip file into a new directory located in your Winamp Skins
directory. For example, you can call it
<em class="emphasis">Winamp/Skins/MySkins</em>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>After you have installed the <a name="INDEX-1085" />Base Skin, take a look at the files in
that directory. There should be a number of cursor
(<em class="emphasis">.cur</em>) files, several bitmap
(<em class="emphasis">.bmp</em>) files, and a few text
(<em class="emphasis">.txt</em>) files. It's important to note that
all of these files are optional -- Winamp uses the built-in
default files if it finds any pieces of the skin collection missing.
</p>

<p>The filenames for the cursor files are fairly self-explanatory. For
example, <em class="emphasis">EQTitle.cur</em> is the cursor for the
equalizer's title bar. Likewise,
<em class="emphasis">normal.cur</em><a name="INDEX-1086" /> is the default
<a name="INDEX-1087" />cursor used
in Winamp's main window. The Playlist Editor WindowShade sizing
area is referred to as
<em class="emphasis">PWSSize.cur</em><a name="INDEX-1088" />. If you have questions about which file
is which, try making changes to see where the change takes effect.
You will need a third-party utility such as
<a name="INDEX-1089" />Microangelo
(<a href="../../../../../../www.impactsoft.com/">http://www.impactsoft.com</a>) to create custom
cursors.
</p>

<p>The process of editing the bitmap files can be a bit more
complicated. As with the cursor files, the bitmap files are named
according to their functions and have the <em class="emphasis">.bmp</em>
extension. The file
<em class="emphasis">pledit.bmp</em><a name="INDEX-1090" />
alters the look of the Playlist Editor. The file
<em class="emphasis">eqmain.bmp</em><a name="INDEX-1091" /> changes the look of the graphic
equalizer, and all the other <em class="emphasis">.bmp</em> files
<a name="INDEX-1092" />change
the look of individual controls of the main controls.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>To create your skin, open and edit each <em class="emphasis">.bmp</em>
file in your graphics editor; be sure to use the same filenames. To
be safe, you should save your new skin files to a separate
directory -- always keep the same filenames.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>After you've made changes to the different bitmap files,
you'll want to see the changes you've made in action. To
do this, either restart Winamp or hit the F5 key to refresh.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can change other aspects of Winamp via the three
<em class="emphasis">.txt</em> files included in the Skin template
archive. Again, after making changes to these files, be sure to
restart Winamp or hit F5 to reload the skin.
</p>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">pledit.txt</em> file changes the font and color
of the playlist text. The format is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[Text]
Normal=#00FF00 
Current=#FFFFFF
NormalBG=#000000
SelectedBG=#000080
Font=Arial</pre></blockquote>

<p>After the <tt class="literal">[Text]</tt> line, the first line specifies
the text color (in hexadecimal values) for unselected entries; the
second line specifies the text color for selected entries; the third
and fourth lines specify the background colors for unselected and
selected entries, respectively. The fifth line, obviously, specifies
the font.
</p>

<p>The
<em class="emphasis">viscolor.txt</em><a name="INDEX-1093" /> file has 24 lines, with each line
consisting of an RGB triplet and a comment. For example, a line in
the file could look like this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">32,37,21, // comment </pre></blockquote>

<p>These 24 lines define the colors used in Winamp's built-in
visualizer. The default <em class="emphasis">viscolor.txt</em> is well
commented, and will tell you which lines change which colors.
</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">region.txt</em> is for specifying transparent regions
in your skin, which lets you create nonrectangular shapes or cut-outs
in Winamp's main and EQ windows. Careful editing of this file
will let you include the parts you wish to show, and make the rest
transparent. Remember, if you have trouble with this or other files,
you may simply delete them and the default Winamp settings will be
used.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When you're finished creating your skins, zip them up and
upload them to an Internet skins archive so others <a name="INDEX-1094" />can enjoy your
creations as <a name="INDEX-1095" /> <a name="INDEX-1096" />well.

<h3 class="sect2">8.3.5. Plug-ins</h3>

<p>While skins let you customize the appearance of your MP3 player, you
can improve or extend the functionality of your player by adding
modules to the plug-ins subdirectory. While most
<a name="INDEX-1099" />
<a name="INDEX-1100" />MP3 players support plug-ins, not all of
them do.
</p>

<p>There is a seemingly infinite variety of third-party plug-ins
available, but they all fall into a few overarching categories:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p><a name="INDEX-1101" /> Input
plug-ins allow your player both to play audio file formats that are
not built into the player itself and to accept signals from external
devices such as keyboards or stereo components.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><a name="INDEX-1102" />Output
plug-ins allow your MP3 player to export signals to other audio file
formats.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><a name="INDEX-1103" />DSP/Effects plug-ins let you apply any
number of audio special effects, such as distortion, echo, reverb,
and more.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Visualization plug-ins, which are perhaps the most popular of the
lot, let you "see" your music in displays far more
sophisticated and psychedelic than the simple visualizers built into
most MP3 players.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>In addition, some plug-ins let you do things that aren't easily
categorized, such as handling incoming signals from universal remote
control units. <a name="INDEX-1104" />Visualization plug-ins cover the gamut
from 3-D graphics, to spectral analysis, to other exciting visual
arrays, some of which are shown in <a href="ch08_03.htm">Figure 8-6</a>. If
your platform is Be, check out the
<a name="INDEX-1105" />BeOS skin as shown in
<a href="ch08_03.htm">Figure 8-7</a>.

<p>Other plug-ins include <a name="INDEX-1106" />audio processors,
<a name="INDEX-1107" />audio input and output modules, and
general plug-ins that allow such functions as infrared remote control
of your player. One such plug-in even allows control of MP3 playback
over a local area network (LAN). Interest in MP3 plug-in development
shows no signs of slowing down, which should lead to more and more
sophisticated plug-ins <a name="INDEX-1108" />and supported devices over time.
