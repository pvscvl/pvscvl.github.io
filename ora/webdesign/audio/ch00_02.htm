<h2 class="sect1">0.2. Why we wrote this book</h2>

<p><em class="citetitle">Designing Web Audio</em> was born out of our
passion for music and technology and the desire to share this
knowledge with others around the world. The production of a good web
soundtrack and "sonic experience" requires musical and
artistic skill, a basic understanding of acoustics, and technological
savvy. Our goal in writing this book was to teach and inspire the
complete range of skills necessary to create a great web soundtrack
and compelling user experience.
</p>

<p>Another inspiration for writing this book was to encourage web
professionals not to overlook the powerful impact that audio can and
will add to a web site. Seasoned veterans of the television and film
industry will be the first to tell you that audio is a key element in
the success of any major production. For example, films directed by
George Lucas and Steven Spielberg would not have made such an impact
without the impressive soundtracks created by composers such as John
Williams and sound designers such as Ben Burtt and Gary Rydstrom.
</p>

<p>As many musicians and sound designers know, audio often takes the
"back seat" to graphics and visuals. Sometimes there are
good reasons for this: lean production budgets or short timelines
dictate that certain elements such as text and graphics take priority
over audio. Sometimes bandwidth constraints alone are simply too
great to include large audio files on a web site. But in many cases,
audio is not factored into the production budget because it is deemed
to provide no tangible use or benefit to the audience. Worse, sound
is often left out because of a lack of knowledge of how to use the
tools and techniques needed to create effective soundtracks.
</p>

<p>To educate web developers about the power of sound and about the
techniques for producing high-fidelity audio became our rallying cry
for the duration of this project. Fortunately, since more and more
successful high-traffic web sites have integrated sound over the past
year, our job has become less about convincing people to use audio,
and more about teaching them how to use audio well.
