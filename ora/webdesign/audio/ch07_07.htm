<h2 class="sect1">7.7. Case study: TechWeb Today</h2>

<p>When RealNetworks introduced the preview <a name="INDEX-1031" />version of its G2 player in June 1998,
it offered its content partners (those that had a default button on
the player itself) a few basic G2 templates to help create simple
presentations. Many partners used those templates. However, to create
TechWeb's daily streaming media show, <em class="emphasis">TechWeb
Today</em>, the <a name="INDEX-1032" />TechWeb team, including producer Leah
Goldberg, decided to slave over the hot code and build a unique show
from scratch. That way, they could explore and take advantage of the
capabilities of this new streaming-multimedia platform.
</p>

<p>In this section, we cover the steps Leah Goldberg used to build the
<em class="emphasis">TechWeb Today</em> show featured in <a href="ch07_07.htm">Figure 7-8</a>, including code examples and helpful
workarounds to common problems.

<h3 class="sect2">7.7.1. Deciding what to show</h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1033" />first step to constructing a G2
presentation is to establish your content plan and graphic design.
You have to determine what media and datatypes you plan to use. Will
your show contain a video, or will you instead present your
information in the form of a slideshow with an associated audio
track? Will you stream information as text, or will you make and
stream graphics that contain text?
</p>

<p>The TechWeb production team decided to develop a segmented
presentation to offer a more targeted user experience. Instead of a
linear news program, the show is comprised of four five-minute
distinct segments: an introductory segment and three topical
sub-channels.
</p>

<p>The introductory segment begins by announcing the day's
programming on the sub-channels, then offers a three-minute video
newscast. Viewers can click to visit any sub-channel during or at the
end of the presentation. All three sub-channels have the same basic
structure: while a video plays, text and explanatory graphics augment
the video.
</p>

<p>Once you have established your basic content plan and design, the
next step is to roll up your sleeves and start coding to build the
presentation piece by piece.
</p>

<p>To do that, <a name="INDEX-1034" />first design the overall layout of your
presentation, including its size and the precise placement of each
file being used. <em class="emphasis">TechWeb Today</em> 's
introductory segment is composed of 14 distinct regions. <a href="ch07_07.htm">Example 7-9</a> shows the code for the root layout and 4 of
the 14 regions.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-7-EX-9" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 7-9. The code for TechWeb's root layout and four regions </h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;root-layout width="421" height="323"/&gt;
&lt;region id="background" width="421" height="323" top="0" left="0"
    z-index="0"/&gt;
&lt;region id="date" width="180" height="14" left="30" top="74"
     z-index="1"/&gt;
&lt;region id="video" width="176" height="144" left="32" top="98"
    z-index="1" &gt;
&lt;region id="caption" width="176" height="60" left="34" top="255"
    z-index="1"/&gt;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>The background region in <a href="ch07_07.htm">Example 7-9</a> is 421 pixels
wide and 323 pixels high and begins in the upper-leftmost corner
(0,0) of the overall layout. In fact, the overall size of the
presentation is 421 x 323 pixels, so this region covers the
entire area. Notice that the background has a
<a name="INDEX-1035" />z-index of 0, while
the other three regions have z-indexes of 1. Therefore, the file that
is eventually sourced into the background region will appear beneath
all the regions with higher z-indexes, wherever they overlap.
</p>

<p>The date region is 180 pixels wide by 14 pixels high, and its
upper-left corner is at the coordinates (30,74). Similarly, the video
region is 176 x 144 pixels, begins at (32,98), and is also
placed over the background, where they overlap. <a href="ch07_07.htm">Figure 7-9</a> shows four regions: the background region in
gray and the date region that sits above the video region. The
caption region sits below the video region.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-7-FIG-9" /><div class="figure"><img height="198" alt="Figure 7-9" src="figs/aud.0709.gif" width="153" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 7-9. The four regions: background, date, video, and caption</h4>

<p>In the body of the SMIL file, Leah Goldberg sourced the following
files into the regions described in <a href="ch07_07.htm">Figure 7-9</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;img src="background.rp" region="background"/&gt;
&lt;video src="newsVideo.rm" region="video"/&gt;
&lt;text src="date.rt" region="date"/&gt;
&lt;text src="captions.rt" region="caption"/&gt;</pre></blockquote>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-7-SECT-7.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.7.2. Synchronizing media types</h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1036" />SMIL
file also establishes the overall timeline and synchronization of a
presentation. As described in the SMIL section earlier, the
<tt class="literal">&lt;par&gt;</tt> tag designates a group of files that
will stream and play in parallel with each other, or at the same
time, and the <tt class="literal">&lt;seq&gt;</tt> tag designates files
that will be played in sequence, or one after another.
</p>

<p>In <a href="ch07_07.htm">Example 7-10</a>, the RealPix file and two text files
are all within the same <tt class="literal">&lt;par&gt;</tt> tags, so they
will all begin at precisely the same time. As soon as the video ends,
a still image of <em class="emphasis">TechWeb Today</em> 's logo
appears in the video space. Nested within the
<tt class="literal">&lt;par&gt;</tt> tags are
<tt class="literal">&lt;seq&gt;</tt> tags, which first source a video, and
then a RealPix file, which sources the logo. Because the two files
are within <tt class="literal">&lt;seq&gt;</tt> tags, they will play one
after the other, in the order in which they are listed. Because they
are nested within the <tt class="literal">&lt;par&gt;</tt> tags, the first
one (the video) will begin at the same time as
<em class="filename">background.rp</em> and the two text files, which are
also within the <tt class="literal">&lt;par&gt;</tt> tags.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-7-EX-10" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 7-10. Code for the timeline </h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;par&gt;
     &lt;img src="background.rp" region="background"/&gt;
     &lt;seq&gt;
          &lt;video src="newsVideo.rm" region="video"/&gt;
          &lt;img src="logo-end.rp" region="video"/&gt;
     &lt;/seq&gt;
     &lt;text src="date.rt" region="date" begin="2s"/&gt;
     &lt;text src="br-captions.rt" region="caption" begin="2s"/&gt;
&lt;/par&gt;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>You'll also notice some <tt class="literal">begin</tt> attributes in
<a href="ch07_07.htm">Example 7-10</a>. This attribute enables you to stream
two files simultaneously, but delay the start of one. The two text
files will actually load two seconds after the other files within
their <tt class="literal">&lt;par&gt;</tt> tag. This attribute was used so
the background image has time to load before the overlaying text
elements appear.
</p>

<p>In <em class="emphasis">TechWeb Today</em>, the file
<em class="filename">background.rp</em> controls the behavior and timing
of four images: the background image and the three photos that
represent each sub-channel.
</p>

<p>Each image is first sourced and given a numeric handle: </p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;image handle="1" name="background.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;image handle="2" name="channel1.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;image handle="3" name="channel2.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;image handle="4" name="channel3.jpg"/&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Then <a name="INDEX-1037" />timing and
behavior of the images are coded in the effect tags.
</p>

<p>For example, to get the background image
(<tt class="literal">handle="1"</tt>) to appear at the beginning of the
show, Leah Goldberg used the <tt class="literal">&lt;fadein/&gt;</tt> tag
to introduce the image. The fade-in effect starts precisely at the
beginning of the show (<tt class="literal">start="0"</tt>) and lasts one
second (<tt class="literal">duration="1000"</tt>).
</p>

<p>Remember that the <tt class="literal">duration</tt> attribute refers to the
duration of the effect, not the duration the image will display. The
background graphic fades in over the course of one second, then stays
in place for the show's duration. The line of code looks like
this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;fadein start="0" duration="1000" target="1"/&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Once the background has faded in, the first of the three channel
photos appears in the same area where the video eventually appears.
Unlike the background image, these are smaller images (176 x
131), and the idea was to get them to appear in a precise area of the
display window, on top of the background image. Goldberg used the
destination attributes to precisely place the upper-left corner of
the photo at (32,105):
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;fadein start="1000" duration="1000" target="2" dstx="32"
    dsty="105" dstw="176" dsth="131"/&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Next, the TechWeb team wanted the photo to become smaller and move to
the right of the display window to take its place beneath the links
that lead to its channel. They used the
<tt class="literal">&lt;viewchange/&gt;</tt><a name="INDEX-1038" />
tag to accomplish this effect. Again, they specified a start time and
the duration of the viewchange effect.
</p>

<p>For this effect, use both the source and destination attributes to
specify the beginning and destination size and placement of the
image. Between the 9- and 10-second marks, the photo will shrink from
its original size of 176 x 131 to 55 x 40 (maintaining
its aspect ratio). As it is shrinking, it also moves across the
display window from having a top-left coordinate of (32,105) to
(295,54):
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;viewchange start="9000" duration="1000" srcx="32" srcy="105"
     srcw="176" srch="131" dstx="295" dsty="54" dstw="55"
     dsth="40"/&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Similar fade-ins and viewchanges are used in the rest of the file to
describe the behavior of the next two channel photos.
</p>

<p>As described earlier, any text used in a presentation must reside
within a RealText file. The <em class="filename">date.rt</em> file in this
case simply contains the date of the show. It appears in one location
and never moves or changes:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;window type="generic" height="14" width="180"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size="1" face="arial" color="#993300"&gt;
Updated November 1, 4 p.m. PDT&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/window&gt; </pre></blockquote>

<p>The file <em class="filename">captions.rt</em> contains the three captions
that appear beneath each channel graphic consecutively in the same
area, according to the following time settings:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;window type="generic" width="176" height="60"&gt;
&lt;time begin="1.0" end="9.5"/&gt;
&lt;font face="arial" size="1"&gt;Channel 1 caption&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;time begin="10.0" end="19.5"/&gt;
&lt;font face="arial" size="1"&gt;Channel 2 caption&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;time begin="20.0" end="29.5"/&gt;
&lt;font face="arial" size="1"&gt;Channel 3 caption&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/window&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<h3 class="sect2">7.7.3. Problems and workarounds</h3>

<p>As with all new technologies, t<a name="INDEX-1039" />here are lots
of pesky little bugs and limitations that make coding for G2 that
much more fun and challenging.
</p>

<p>When <em class="emphasis">TechWeb Today</em> 's interface was first
designed, the designers had intended that the channel photos would
serve as clickable buttons that viewers could use to access the
sub-channels. You will notice, however, that you must click on the
text links and arrows that appear on the right side of the display
window above the photos to view any of the sub-channels. If you try
to click on the channel photos, either at their full or reduced size,
you will not be linked to the sub-channel. The TechWeb team
constructed the show this way because at present, a graphic can link
to a web page that will load in a browser window, but a graphic
cannot link to another SMIL file. Only text can link to other SMIL
files.
</p>

<p>Another frustration with coding for G2 is that a number of attributes
and syntaxes are inconsistent across the three markup languages. For
example, the syntax and default values for time are different in all
three languages.
</p>

<p>In SMIL, the attribute is <tt class="literal">begin</tt>, and time is
denoted with a number followed by the abbreviations
<tt class="literal">h</tt> (hours), <tt class="literal">min</tt> (minutes),
<tt class="literal">s</tt> (seconds), or <tt class="literal">ms</tt>
(milliseconds). Two-and-a-half seconds is written as
<tt class="literal">begin="2.5s"</tt>. Time can also be written according
to the formula <tt class="literal">npt:hh:mm:ss.xy</tt>. Two-and-a-half
seconds would be written as <tt class="literal">begin="npt:2.5"</tt>. If
you use that syntax, you must put <tt class="literal">npt</tt>: (normal
play time) before the number.
</p>

<p>In RealPix markup languageRealPix, by default, time is written simply
as the number of milliseconds, and the attribute is
<tt class="literal">start</tt>. Two-and-a-half seconds in RealPix is
written as <tt class="literal">start="2500"</tt>. However, you can specify
a different time format in the header of the file, for example,
<tt class="literal">timeformat="dd:hh:mm:ss.xyz"</tt>. If you do this, all
the time values in your RealPix file must follow that format, and
two-and-a-half seconds is then written as
<tt class="literal">start="2.5"</tt>.
</p>

<p>In <a name="INDEX-1040" />RealText, time is denoted
<tt class="literal">dd:hh:mm:ss.xyz</tt>, where <tt class="literal">dd</tt> is
days and <tt class="literal">xyz</tt> is milliseconds. As in SMIL, the
attribute is <tt class="literal">begin</tt>. Two-and-a-half seconds is
written <tt class="literal">begin="2.5"</tt> (with no
<tt class="literal">npt:</tt> prefix, and not followed by
<tt class="literal">s</tt>).
</p>

<p>Why are there differences in syntaxes and functionalities between
RealText and RealPix? Part of the answer is that RealNetworks
developed RealText in-house but outsourced the development of
RealPix. Although all three languages work together to build a
cohesive presentation in the same platform, producers need to
remember three slightly different ways of coding the same
thing.<a name="INDEX-1041" />
