<h2 class="sect1">9.3. Introduction to Shockwave</h2>

<p>Shockwave for Director is a software component that enables
compatible browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet
Explorer 2.0 and higher to play multimedia Director movies over the
Web. Shockwave is designed to work with standard HTTP servers and is
ideal for streaming short- to medium-length audio files and advanced
multimedia presentations and games.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-1304" />Shockwave movies are built within Director using the Score window, where all media
elements are placed as cast members on channels or tracks along a
timeline, as shown in <a href="ch09_03.htm">Figure 9-14</a>.
<a name="INDEX-1305" />Director is a
powerful tool for orchestrating multiple media types such as video,
animation, and sound into complex interactive presentations.
</p>

<p>Director uses <a name="INDEX-1306" />Lingo script to create sophisticated interactive games and presentations.
Originally it was designed to provide CD-ROM developers with an
advanced cross-platform authoring solution for building multimedia
presentations. Shockwave uses Director's Lingo scripting to
directly interact with the operating system and multimedia
functionality of a PC. Lingo enables the development of complex
interactive soundtracks with audio fade-ins and fade-outs and panning
effects tied to specific user actions. For example, with Lingo you
can specify elegant cross-fades of separate audio clips when a user
transitions from one scene or web page to another, instead of
abruptly cutting off a sound.
</p>

<p>The drawback to broadcasting
<a name="INDEX-1307" />Shockwave-based
presentations is that they tend to be too large and cumbersome for
28.8 Kbps modems. As Internet bandwidth increases with xDSL and
cable, Shockwave will play a more prominent role in web multimedia.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-9-SIDEBAR-7" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">The Enigma audio mixer</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>Three monks stand in a darkened room. A distant rhythm begins to
pulse in a repeating pattern. The beat gets louder and louder until
one of the monks raises his head and begins to sing a
mystical-sounding Gregorian chant before being joined by the other
two monks. Their voices, along with the pulsing background rhythm
create a rich-sounding music mix that seems familiar. Then, with the
click of a button, two of the monks lower their voices in silence.
The third monk sings for several seconds before fading into silence
like the others.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The chanting combined with the pulsing rhythm loop sounds like a tune
the popular music group <a name="INDEX-1308" />
<a name="INDEX-1309" />Enigma
might have created. In fact, as Josh Feldman, Creative Director at
Prophet Communications, a division of Frog Design (<a href="../../../../../../www.frogdesign.com/">http://www.frogdesign.com</a>), pointed out, that was
the purpose of the Enigma III Shockwave audio mixer he and Thor
Muller created for Virgin Records.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Prophet Communications worked with Virgin Records to develop an
online interactive experience to promote Enigma's album. The
Shockwave audio mixer let visitors to the Enigma web site
(<a href="../../../../../../www.enigma.com/">http://www.enigma.com</a>) create their own
music mix using an assembly of instruments and voices. The mixer
contains four music loops represented by the image of three monks and
a drum set, as shown in <a href="ch09_03.htm">Figure 9-15</a>. When a user
clicks on one of the objects, an audio loop begins to play.
</p>
&nbsp;
<a name="sound-CHP-9-FIG-15" /><div class="figure"><img height="281" alt="Figure 9-15" src="figs/aud.0915.gif" width="400" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-15. The Enigma Shockwave Mixer by Prophet Communications</h4>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p>What made this mixer so successful was Prophet Communications'
elegant use of simple Lingo scripts to make the mixer more than just
an assemblage of simultaneous loops. Lingo scripts were used
judiciously to add fade-ins and fade-outs to the monk's voices.
Instead of an abrupt sound interrupting the audio mix, each new sound
transitioned smoothly into the full audio mix, the same as it would
in a live performance or recording. The use of fade-ins and fade-outs
for all the sounds in the mix made for a good soundtrack that
enhanced the entertainment experience and ambiance of the web site.
Here are Prophet's top five tips for using audio with
<a name="INDEX-1310" />Shockwave:
</p>
&nbsp;
<ul><li>
<p>Leave four seconds of audio at the end of your Shockwave File.
Shockwave will sometimes cut off the last three or four seconds of a
streaming audio file, so it is always a good idea to put some blank
space at the end of the sound file.
</p>
</li>
&nbsp;
<li>
<p>Never use streaming audio when you need immediate user feedback.
Streaming audio is great for reducing file size and playing long
audio files, but remember that the streaming audio file has to
preload for three to five seconds to play well. If you assign a
streaming audio sound to a button, a user with a 28.8 Kbps modem
connection who clicks the button will not hear the sound until almost
five seconds later.
</p>
</li>
&nbsp;
<li>
<p>Use Lingo variables to add richness to your interactive content. When
a user clicks on a button or triggers an audio loop, a Lingo script
can randomly select from many different <em class="filename">.swa</em>
files residing on the server. Using variables is a clever way to add
more content to your web site without requiring additional download
time.
</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p>To configure random controls in Lingo, set the URL of member
"<em class="emphasis">shockaudio"="sounds/"&amp;random(4)&amp;"song.swa</em>". Then set the preLoadTime of member "shockaudio" to 5
Play. This will randomly pick from four files called
<em class="filename">1song.swa</em>, <em class="filename">2song.swa</em>,
<em class="filename">3song.swa</em>, and <em class="filename">4song.swa</em> located
in a folder within your master movie directory folder that contains
all the media elements for your Shockwave presentation. The folder
that contains your <em class="filename">.swa</em> audio files can be named
any name you choose as long as you use the same name within your
Lingo script. The folder then gets uploaded to a web server along
with the master movie folder. Note that the above script was written
for Director 5. If you're using Director 6 or higher you may
have to change the way the streaming audio file is called up.
</p>
</li>
&nbsp;
<li>
<p>When embedding a movie that contains no images and only plays a sound
file, make the dimension of the movie 1 pixel by 2 pixels instead of
1 x 1. In older browsers, the 1 x 1 pixel movies often
fill the whole screen instead of staying at their dimension. This
error has been fixed in newer browsers. But to be safe, embed them as
1 x 2 pixels.
</p>
</li>
&nbsp;
<li>
<p>Do not set levels to 100% when normalizing your audio files.
Normalize to 85% or 95% to avoid distortion. 100% normalized audio
files imported into Shockwave are likely to cause distortion when
played back through cheap amps in PC sound cards. This also applies
to audio files converted to RealAudio or QuickTime.

<a name="sound-CHP-9-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.3.1. Using Shockwave "internal" sounds: embedded cast members versus streamed SWA sounds</h3>

<p>You can incorporate two basic forms of audio into
<a name="INDEX-1311" />Shockwave movies: embedded internal
sounds (such as buttons, loops, and short transition sounds) and
streamed audio with Director's Shockwave Audio (SWA).
<a name="INDEX-1312" />SWA is a variant
of MPEG 3-based compression that adds support for storing cue point
data in the audio file.
<a name="INDEX-1313" />Director allows you to attach cue
points along an audio file that trigger events such as the start of a
video clip or animation sequence. You can also use third-party
solutions for playing audio through Shockwave, including RealAudio
with the <a name="INDEX-1314" />RealMedia Xtra, RMF files with the
<a name="INDEX-1315" />Beatnik Xtra,
<a name="INDEX-1316" />QuickTime audio,
and even audio embedded into Flash movies.
</p>

<p>Short button sound effects and loops are incorporated into
<a name="INDEX-1317" />Shockwave as embedded audio cast
members, similar to event-driven sounds in Flash. Embedded audio
clips play instantaneously when triggered by a user action. They also
allow for greater
<a name="INDEX-1318" />Lingo scripting
control than does streamed sound. Any short sound that is directly
linked to the action of a user and requires instant playback should
be placed in your Shockwave movie as an embedded audio file. Note,
however, that despite Shockwave compression ratios of 44:1, embedded
sounds still add tremendous size to your Director files, so use them
sparingly.
</p>

<p>With <a name="INDEX-1319" />Director 6 and later, embedded audio can
be delivered as a streaming cast member. This means you can
orchestrate the download of different cast members so that content
appears quickly while cast members from later scenes download in the
background. Plan your streaming Shockwave movie carefully so any cast
member that Lingo calls up will have previously downloaded into the
cast member library. Director 7 also adds support for imported SWA
cast members. In previous versions, SWA compression was applied to
all audio cast members when the file was "burned" into a
Shockwave (<em class="filename">.dcr</em>) file, and only one compression
ratio could be applied to all the audio cast
members.<a name="INDEX-1320" />
<a name="INDEX-1321" />
.<em class="filename">dcr</em> is the file type extension for movies
exported from Director.
</p>

<p>In Director 7, you can create SWA cast members at rates as low as 8
Kbps using audio-editing tools like <a name="INDEX-1322" />Sound Forge, <a name="INDEX-1323" />SoundEdit 16, or
<a name="INDEX-1324" />Peak, and then import
the compressed cast members into Director. As of Director 7.0.2 and
higher, you can import MP3 files in addition to SWA files.
</p>

<p>Streaming sounds need at least a three-to-five-second buffer time
before playback and are thus mainly used for longer-playing audio
files. The preload buffer time required for smooth playback of
streaming audio prevents this type of audio from being used for
button sounds or loops.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-9-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.3.2. Creating transparent Shockwave loops</h3>

<p>One of the quickest ways to incorporate
<a name="INDEX-1325" />Shockwave audio into your
web pages is to use a 1 x 2-pixel Shockwave movie to play audio
loops or short greetings. To add a compelling soundtrack, use a
transparent Shockwave movie with invisible frames to make one audio
loop play across several web pages. By using transparent frames, you
can use different ambient loops thematically throughout your web
site.
</p>

<p>Using different loops for various groups of web pages is a great
technique for adding variety to a web site and a way to avoid the
risk of annoying people with loops that stop playing when they click
from one web page to another.
</p>

<p>To get started, open the folder <em class="filename">bgkdloop</em>, found
in the Shockwave or Director directories. It contains:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><em class="filename">bgkdloop.dcr</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>An almost invisible Shockwave movie.</p>
</dd><dt><b><em class="filename">bgkdloop.dir</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The source movie that produced <em class="filename">bgkdloop.dcr</em>
(courtesy of Macromedia).
</p>
</dd><dt><b><em class="filename">bgkdloop.htm</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>An HTML template page that displays no interface or user controls.
The default page simply autostreams a sound when the page containing
the movie is loaded into your browser.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Drag the file <em class="filename">bgkdloop.htm</em> onto your browser
icon, preferably Netscape or Explorer 3.0 or higher. After the page
loads, it goes black and your SWA file begins to stream
automatically. When you play the file back, you may see a tiny dot in
the top-left corner of your browser window; this is the 1 x
2-pixel frame of the Shockwave movie.
</p>

<p>The web page with the Shockwave movie should contain the following
object tag:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;OBJECT CLASSID="clsid:166B1BCA-3F9C-11CF-8075-444553540000" 
CODEBASE="http://active.macromedia.com/director/cabs/sw.cab#version=6,0,0,0"

swURL="intro.swa" swTEXT="" swPreLoadTime="5" sw2="1" sw3="0"&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>If the sound is playing properly, start adding pictures and text to
your web page.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-9-SECT-4.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.3.3. Shockwave streaming audio</h3>

<p>There have been several major innovations in the latest versions of
Shockwave.
<a name="INDEX-1326" />Shockwave movies exported from Director
5 and earlier versions had the capacity to stream only audio.
Graphics and animations had to download in their entirety before they
could play back. Thus, if you were streaming a music video, the
graphic content would have to download first before the music video
began to play. An average 250 KB Shockwave movie exported from
Director 5 or lower produced extremely long wait times, causing many
people to leave a page before the movie downloaded.
</p>

<p>The release of Director 6 marked a major breakthrough. With
<a name="INDEX-1327" />Director 6 and later, individual cast
members are broken into separate packets of data and streamed in the
background while a <em class="filename">.swa</em> audio file plays. This
means that a Shockwave streaming audio file can begin to play almost
immediately with its accompanying visual content. This feature allows
you to create longer, more complex movies and interactive
entertainment.
</p>

<p>Director 6 and 7 also have the capability to read markers on your
audio file set in Sound Edit16. With this feature, it is possible to
sync your streaming audio with the appearance of a designated graphic
or animated cast member.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-9-SECT-4.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">9.3.4. Exporting Shockwave audio files</h3>

<p>Use Macromedia's SoundEdit 16 to create
<a name="INDEX-1328" />Shockwave audio (SWA) files using
the <a name="INDEX-1329" />SWA
Export Xtra. You can also convert WAV audio files to SWA files in
Director for Windows. When you create an audio file with the SWA
Export Xtra, the new file is compressed using
<a name="INDEX-1330" />MPEG Layer 3 compression. To use the

</p>

<ol><li>
<p>In SoundEdit 16 version 2.0 or higher, open the audio file you want
to export.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose Shockwave for Audio Settings in the Xtras dialog menu to
configure the compression options. <a href="ch09_03.htm">Figure 9-17</a> shows

refers to how much analysis is performed on the original file before

the lowest bitrates, the difference is not significant. The
Preprocessing checkbox gives the option of converting stereo files to
mono as part of the SWA encoding process. At settings of 32 Kbps or

</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Work with 16-bit 22.050 or 44.100 kHz files (22.050 kHz is

</p>
</li><li>
<p>To improve the quality of SWA files encoded at modem speeds (16 Kbps
and 24 Kbps), filtering of frequencies in the range of 4 kHz to 8 kHz
can reduce crunch and distortion on certain 22.050 kHz files.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Stereo source files should share common information on both channels.
If the two channels carry unrelated information, there will be an
uneven quality level between them.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>As a last step before converting to an SWA file, normalize the audio
file to 95%. Giving the file at least 5% extra headroom prevents
distortion.

<dd>
<p>This is where you set the amount of preload buffer time in seconds.
More preload time produces a greater delay between clicking Play and
hearing your SWA file. Generally a four- to five-second preload time
helps ensure continuous playback without drop-outs.

</dd>

</dl>

<p>As the SWA file streams from the server to your computer, it fills
the buffer. As the SWA file plays, it empties the buffer. If these
two rates are the same, playback will not be interrupted. If the
Internet is slow, the buffer may not be filled as quickly as it is
emptied. This can result in playback stopping for a moment as the
buffer waits to be filled up again.
