This book is about adding audio to your web site. Why would you want to do that? Simply put, to enhance the user experience. If sound were not an integral part of the user experience, we'd still be sitting in silent-movie houses watching the likes of Gloria Swanson swoon and bat her eyelashes to convey a romantic interest, or Valentino beating his chest to show us the remorse of lost love. Instead, filmmakers learned to use audio technology to incorporate sound and music to transform the movie-going experience. 
</p>
<p>Just as sound and music in film and television help drive the
audiences' emotions, you can provide a more engaging and
compelling experience for your audience by adding audio to the text,
graphics, and animation you've already developed for your site.
The soundtrack of a film is often the element that makes us cry,
sense fear, or feel the adrenaline of an exciting chase scene. A web
soundtrack helps you communicate and connect with your audience by
setting a mood that draws in visitors, makes them stay longer, helps
them navigate easily using audio cues, and gives them occasion to
return often. Take away the audio and you have a silent experience
that is no more real or gripping than a postcard.
</p>

<p>But while good use of sound attracts people to your web site, poor
use of sound detracts from it. In fact, a badly designed soundtrack
or poorly recorded audio clip may make your site sound unprofessional
and even turn people away.
</p>

<p>This chapter teaches you how to effectively use web audio to increase
sales and customer satisfaction or simply how to make web content
more interesting and engaging. We'll cover the basics of sound
and digital audio, and show you how to apply the principles and
techniques of film, television, and CD-ROM production to your site.
The techniques and workarounds presented in this chapter will help
you build a great web soundtrack for both low- and high-bandwidth
sites and will point the way to the future where web audio rivals the
quality and sophistication of film and television sound production.

<h2 class="sect1">1.1. A brief history of web audio</h2>

<p>While audio is now commonplace on the web, it took the rise in
commercial interest in the medium to generate the developments you
see and hear today. Prior to events such as the initial public
offering of Netscape in 1996, web sites were largely non-profit
affairs with sparse, text-based pages and few, if any, graphical
embellishments. The meteoric rise in commercial browser use created
an almost clamorous demand for professional graphic designers with
high-quality media production skills. In little time, huge numbers of
web sites were transformed into polished corporate marketing
brochures, and the once dry text pages of scientific journals were
looking more like slick designer magazines.
</p>

<p>But as much as the Web was improving in its graphic appeal, it
remained a silent medium. The only audio content available other than
<a name="INDEX-1" />MIDI were large
<em class="filename">.wav</em> or <em class="filename">.au</em> files that took
minutes or even hours to download before they could be played. The
Web was far from an entertainment or broadcast medium.
</p>

<p>In late 1996, RealNetworks broke through the silence with the intro
duction of RealAudio, a monophonic streaming technology. RealAudio
<a name="INDEX-2" />allowed users to
click on a link and listen to audio "streaming" across
the Internet. Since its inception, RealAudio has made huge
advancements in its sound quality. Meanwhile, the competition in the
web audio space continues to intensify with the introduction of
another new technology,
<a name="INDEX-3" />MP3
(see <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, "Playing, Serving, and Streaming MP3"</a> for more information). Streaming
MP3 can provide even higher quality audio over limited bandwidths.
