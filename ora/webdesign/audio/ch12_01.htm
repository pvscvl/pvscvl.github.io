<dl>
<dt><b>Acoustics</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Term used to describe the science of sound as well as how sound
travels through particular environments. Sound waves reflect and
disperse off of various surfaces in our environment, such as a wall
or trees or even people. These sound waves travel through the air,
bouncing off objects before they reflect back to our ears. We rarely
ever hear the pure direct vibration of a sound wave before it is
masked or altered by the coloration of thousands of small
reflections.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Active Streaming File (ASF) </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Microsoft's proprietary streaming media format.</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>Standard Macintosh file format commonly used on the Internet. </p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Aliasing </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A type of quantization error or digital distortion that occurs during
analog to digital conversion. Sampling rates that are too low to
accurately reproduce a sound often cause aliasing or unwanted sound
artifacts such as a low rumbling or "woosh" noise.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Ambient Soundscape or Loop </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-1619" />term

a mood behind the visual content.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Amplitude </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum change in air pressure. Amplitude is universally measured
in decibels (dB). The metric is used both to measure the loudness of
a sound signal and to mark the maximum cut-off point for analog and
digital recording. This cut-off is the maximum level before
distortion and is called the 0dB point.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Analog Distortion </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The term commonly used in analog tape recording or tube amplification
when a signal goes above the "red" or maximum recording
level. Low-level analog distortion, in contrast to digital
distortion, enriches a sound with harmonics and compresses an audio
signal, raising the level of quieter sounds.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>

equalizer. Generally, you are never boosting or reducing one single
frequency but instead a range of frequencies.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Bandwidth Negotiation </b></dt>

accurate the sound reproduction. In particular, higher bit-depths
reproduce quieter sounds more accurately.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Cardioid Microphone </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A microphone that captures sound directly in front of the capsule,
providing maximum noise rejection. Cardioid mics are primarily used
for live concert vocal recording and amplification because of the
pick-up pattern's excellent feedback-rejection characteristics.

<dl>
<dt><b>Compressor </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A dynamics processor that evens out and compresses incoming audio
signals that vary greatly in dynamic range, such as a singer going
from a soft whisper to a resounding scream. A compressor allows for
the hottest incoming signal without distortion to your sound card by
limiting the sounds that peak above the 0dB distortion point. By
reducing the amplitude of the loudest sounds with a compressor, you
can increase the overall input level of your microphone to capture a
"hotter" or louder signal.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>dB SPL </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Decibels of sound pressure levels, a unit of measurement for the
loudness of sound.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Decibel (dB) </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A logarithmic unit of sound loudness, audio power, or audio voltage. </p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>De-esser </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A dynamics processor or plug-in used to reduce sibilance, or the high
frequencies that contain excessive hissing or "S" sounds.
De-essers are commonly used to clean up voice-over recordings.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Delay </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sound wave reflections or echoes that strike the ear drum after 40
milliseconds of the original sound. Delay, as opposed to reverb, can
be heard as a second distinct sound or echo.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Desktop Audio Recording </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The term for hard-disk audio recording and editing on a desktop
computer as opposed to an outboard tape recording device.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Destructive Editing </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The process of permanently changing or altering the original master
file. When a destructive edit is performed, the sound file is
permanently altered and then rewritten to disk. In contrast,
nondestructive forms of editing never alter or rewrite over the
original sound file.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Digital Audio </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The term applied to sound that has been digitized into binary code.
Sound waves are converted to digital code by means of a circuit that
assigns a value or binary set of numbers that correspond to the shape
of the incoming electrical wave or current.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Digital Audio Tape (DAT) Machine </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A recording device for digital stereo mix-downs and mastering. DAT
two-track tapes look like miniaturized VHS tapes and are smaller and
more affordable than cumbersome and expensive analog tape reels.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Digital Distortion </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The term used to describe a signal that rises over the maximum 0dB
point. Digital distortion produces unpleasant noise and unwanted
"clicks" and "pops," which are also known as
artifacts. Digital encoding, unlike recording to analog tape, cannot
quantify signals above 0dB.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Directionality </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A microphone's capability to reject unwanted sounds coming from
off-axis directions. Each type of microphone has a particular

</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Director Shockwave </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The term applied to Shockwave content authored with Macromedia
Director. Director Shockwave leverages the Lingo scripting language
to directly interact with the operating system and multimedia
functionality of a PC, enabling such capabilities as audio fade-ins
and fade-outs, volume and panning control, and audio synchronized
with animation and mouse rollovers.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Dry </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>An adjective used to describe an original sound or audio signal that
has not been processed or enhanced with effects such as reverb and
delay.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Dynamic Range </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The difference between the loudest point of a sound passage and the
softest point. Audio systems also have a <a name="INDEX-1620" />dynamic range: the difference between the
loudest sound the system can record before distortion and the softest
signal that can be recorded without introducing noise. This range is
measured by the signal-to-noise ratio. The signal is the actual sound
you're after; noise is any hiss or other artifact introduced by
the amplifier, microphone, or other electrical components of the
audio system.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Emblaze </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A <a name="INDEX-1621" />file
format developed by Geo Interactive that allows the playback of any
type of media without plug-ins. Emblaze media playback is controlled
by a small Java applet that automatically downloads when viewed in
3.0 and later browsers. When a visitor enters a site containing
Emblaze content, the small, platform-independent, 50 KB Java applet
or Emblaze Player automatically downloads to the user's
computer, completely transparent to the web visitor.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Envelope </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The term used to describe the shape or contour of the initial attack
or ending decay of a sound. Each instrument or sound has a unique
<a name="INDEX-1622" />
<a name="INDEX-1623" />
<a name="INDEX-1624" />envelope or fade-in and fade-out.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Equalization (EQ ) </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The process of boosting or reducing the amplitude of particular sound
frequencies. All sounds are made up of an overall spectrum of
frequencies that are simultaneously resonating. Equalization is used
to boost or reduce a range of frequencies within the full sound
spectrum.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Event Sounds </b></dt>

standard for full-scale, high-impact web multimedia. Flash features
vector animation technology ideally suited for low-bandwidth
connections.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Foley </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The art of providing audio realism to visuals in post production.
Foley sounds are often the first sounds added to a film soundtrack
and generally include footsteps, sounds of the actors'
clothing, and prop movements onscreen such as a closing doors or an
object falling to the floor. Foley artists try to emulate the sounds
of real life. The term foley artist originally comes from the time
when real life actors performed in a recording room making sounds and
noises, with various objects, to simulate the sounds of the action on
screen.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Frequency </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Rate or speed of a repeating waveform. A sound's frequency
determines its pitch. The faster the frequency, which is measured in
hertz (Hz) or cycles per second, the higher the pitch.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Frequency Response </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The range of frequencies that a device can reproduce or record. The
human ear has a frequency response of roughly 20 to 20,000 Hz.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Frequency Spectrum </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The complete range of frequencies audible to the human ear. Frequency
spectrum also refers to the range of frequencies present in a
particular sound.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Fundamental </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The lowest harmonic of a given tone or musical sound. A pitch
consists of a dominant frequency, as well as multiples of this
frequency. These additional frequencies are the harmonics. It is the
number and characteristics of the harmonics that help create timbre.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>General MIDI </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A MIDI standard developed to alleviate the problem of unpredictable
playback of MIDI compositions. General MIDI specifies that certain
note numbers or MIDI channels will play the same type of instrument,
such as a drum or piano, across various devices or synthesizers.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Graphic Equalizer </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A machine or dynamics processor that boosts or reduces the amplitude
of a range of frequencies. Graphic equalizers generally have sliding
levers, known as faders, representing the different ranges of
frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz -- the normal hearing range
of a human.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Groovoids</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The term for small, premade sound effects and clips that are built
into the Beatnik plug-in.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Harmonics </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The multiples of a given fundamental frequency. Harmonics affect the
characteristics of a particular sound.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Hertz (Hz) </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The basic unit for measuring frequency. One hertz is equal to one
cycle per second.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>High-Pass Filter </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>An equalization effect that removes all frequencies below a specified
point while preserving those that are above the cut-off point. This
effect is often used to remove lower bass sounds, such as a rumble of
an automobile engine or the sound of a jet plane flying overhead.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HT TP) </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>An Internet transmission protocol designed for transferring
documents, files, and email over the Internet; primarily suited for
the transfer of web pages.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Impedance </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The resistance to current flow. Sounds are colored by the material
and substances they travel through. A voice projected through a wall
will sound different than a voice projected directly into the ear. As
sound travels through the dense materials of a wall, the
high-frequency energy is absorbed into the wood leaving behind only
the lower frequencies. A voice spoken directly into the ear, on the
other hand, will produce an unbearably loud sound. Without the
impedance of a wall or other sound-absorbing materials, the energy of
the higher frequencies of the voice travel straight to the ear drum.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Interactive Sound Design </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The term applied to integrating sound into a non-linear interactive
media format such as a Flash movie or a CD-ROM.

</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>IP Multicasting </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A RealServer feature that allows all users of a network or intranet
to listen to a single live stream, making efficient use of network
resources. Multicasting, instead of many simultaneous point-to-point
connections, delivers a stream to a certain point in the network
where it knows other users are requesting the same file.

larger than a few square miles.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Lavaliere Clip-on Microphone </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A thumbnail-sized microphone designed for inconspicuously capturing
close-proximity voices. Lavaliere microphones are commonly used for
video shoots and TV talk shows where the use of a large microphone on
a bulky stand is unacceptable.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Limiter </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A dynamics processor that limits or prevents signals from peaking
above a specified amplitude level. A limiter works by compressing all
sounds that peak above a specified threshold point. The average
levels of your sound files can be raised several dB beyond the
regular normalization level by using a limiter to compress the
highest volume peaks. Using simple normalization alone to maximize
the dynamic range has limitations. Because the normalization process
simply calculates the available headroom, you are limited by the
proximity of the loudest peak to the maximum cut-off point.

<dl>
<dt><b>Lossless Compression </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A type of compression that squeezes or stuffs data into smaller-sized
data packets without permanently discarding information. Compared to
lossy forms of compression, lossless compression offers superior
audio quality but larger file sizes.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Lossy Compression </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A type of compression that intelligently discards data to achieve
smaller file sizes. Lossy forms of audio compression, similar to JPEG
image compression, permanently discard frequencies above and below
specified points by removing "unnecessary" or redundant
sound information. The client-side decoder or player then
decompresses the compressed file as the audio downloads to a
user's computer and fills in the missing information according
to the instructions set by the decoding algorithm.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Loudness </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The perception of the strength or weakness of a sound wave resulting
from the amount of pressure produced. Sound waves that have more
intensity or larger variations in air pressure produce louder sounds.
Low-intensity sound waves with smaller fluctuations in air pressure
produce quieter sounds. Loudness is not to be confused with
amplitude. Loudness refers to the human perception of sound;
amplitude refers to quantifiable measurements of air pressure
variations.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Low-Pass Filter </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>An equalization effect that allows all the frequencies lower than a

<dl>
<dt><b>MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A language originally developed to connect various electronic music
devices. MIDI has since grown into an important compositional
language and tool. MIDI contains no sound data but merely describes
in the form of a "composer's score" how a device
should playback music. MIDI files are ideally suited for web
transmission since they are small, text-based "scores"
and not actual representations of sound itself.

<p>The inherent background noise level in an audio signal. Poor-quality
audio equipment produces a higher noise floor.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Nondestructive Editing </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A form of audio editing that preserves the original sound file and
does not permanently change or rewrite over the original master file
but instead merely alters its playback. Nondestructive edits become
permanent once the final mix is recorded or "bounced" to
disk. With nondestructive editing, the original source files are
always preserved as separate sound files.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Normalization </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The process of increasing the overall level of a sound file by
boosting the loudest peak in the file up to the maximum 0dB point. If
you are working with pre-recorded material, you will want to
normalize your sound files before converting them to web formats.
Normalization maximizes the dynamic range of a sound file, enhances a
sound by making it more present or clear, and sets a uniform volume
or amplitude level for a group of sound files recorded or mixed at
different volume levels.

<dt><b>Parametric Equalizer </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>An equalizer that allows you to specify the bandwidth and range of
the frequencies you want to boost or lower. Unlike a graphic
equalizer, parametric equalizers feature several knobs for adjusting
bandwidth and gain instead of a horizontal row of faders. Parametric
equalizers provide greater flexibility for altering specific
frequencies.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Pitch </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The sensation of how high or low a sound is perceived. Pitch is
determined by a sound's frequency, or rate of repetition. The
faster the frequency, which is measured in hertz (Hz) or cycles per
second, the higher the pitch. The slower the frequency, the lower the
pitch. On home stereo equipment, high-frequency sounds are often
referred to as "treble" and low-frequency sounds as
"bass." Piercing sounds such as a siren or whistle are
composed of extremely rapid vibrations of air molecules.
Lower-pitched sounds such as a bass guitar consist of slower
vibrating sound waves.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Pitch Shifting </b></dt>

<dt><b>Reverb </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Rapid sound wave reflections that strike the ear drum within 40
milliseconds of the original sound. If a sound reflects off of a wall
that is close to our ears, we hear the reflections or reverb
instantly as part of the richness of the original sound wave decay.
If a sound bounces off a hard reflective surface that is far away, we
hear the reflection as a second distinct sound or echo. This type of
reflection is known as "delay."

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Sound </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The vibration of air molecules in the atmosphere that can be sensed
by the ear. A sound wave is produced by a force that vibrates the
surrounding air molecules, such as a stick striking a wooden surface
or a guitar string being plucked. As the air molecules are set in
motion, they radiate outwards, colliding into other air molecules
like a chain of falling dominoes, until they strike the ear drum.
Each type of disturbance in the atmosphere produces a distinct
pattern of vibrations. These patterns of vibrating air molecules give
a sound its unique loudness, pitch, and timbre.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Sound Design </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The process of orchestrating all sounds including the dialogue, music
score, and sound effects into one cohesive soundtrack. Full-scale
film sound design came about in the late 1970s when film producers
and directors realized they could put a sound signature on an entire
film by hiring one person -- a sound designer -- to orchestrate
all the various audio components into one cohesive soundtrack.

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Studio Reference Speakers </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Professional monitoring speakers that accurately reproduce a
"flat" transparent representation of a sound without
adding coloration, distortion, noise, or equalization. Home stereo
speakers, by contrast, are designed to boost the high and low audio
frequencies to provide a richer sound. Unlike home stereo speakers,
the goal of reference speakers is to give you not the most pleasant
sound, but the most accurate.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>SureStream </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A RealSystem G2 technology for dynamic bandwidth allocation for more
efficient and reliable streaming. SureStream switches down to a lower
bandwidth without rebuffering the clip when a user's Internet
connection degrades or, presumably, if the user's bandwidth was
misjudged. RealEncoder G2 with SureStream generates one master file
that includes several different bandwidth settings.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A protocol that emphasizes the reliable transfer of data between
computers. TCP functions much like an error-correction traffic cop
methodically directing the flow of data packets to the same
destination, while making sure that everything that was sent arrives
at the proper address. TCP, as opposed to UDP, resends lost packets.

reed.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>UDP (User Datagram Protocol) </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A protocol that facilitates the rapid transfer of data between
computers. UDP, unlike TCP, keeps directing traffic and does not
retransmit packets when data is lost or damaged. When a UDP audio
packet drops out, the server keeps sending information causing only a
brief glitch instead of a huge gap of silence.
