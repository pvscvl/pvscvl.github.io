<h2 class="sect1">8.5. Creating a buzz: posting MP3 files to the Internet</h2>

<p>Before we begin, here's <a name="INDEX-1164" />an observation: very few
<a name="INDEX-1165" />MP3 files on the Internet have a right to
be there. Original compositions and music or audio streams to which
the person doing the posting holds the copyright are the only files
that can be legally shared with others. Nevertheless, some readers of
this book are musical artists looking to use the
<a name="INDEX-1166" />Internet as a
distribution mechanism. It is also possible that you're
creating an "Internet radio station" that will allow
others to listen to your music without downloading it. This section
is for those readers. It is not intended for people who simply want
to encode their compact discs to MP3 and share their files with the
world. Doing so is illegal and unethical (why would you want to rip
off the artists you respect and like?), and we do not condone the
practice. (See <a href="ch08_04.htm">the sidebar "Copyright issues"</a> earlier in
this chapter.)
</p>

<p>After you have successfully encoded and auditioned your MP3 files and
are pleased with the quality, the next step is to make them available
to other Internet users. Unlike other complex streaming formats that
require specific posting methods and server configurations, such as
RealAudio, Flash, or Liquid Audio, posting MP3 files is easy. Simply
post the MP3 files just as you would any basic file, taking into
account any legal or copyright issues, of course. A
simple<a name="INDEX-1167" /> <tt class="literal">HREF</tt> tag is all you
need to allow users to download MP3 files:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;A HREF="music.mp3"&gt;Download!&lt;/A&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>There may be one more step to consider -- web servers need to be
configured for each new file type, so they can send proper header
data to visiting browsers (which, in turn, use the data to launch
appropriate helper applications or to know how to display the page).
There's a good chance your web server (or your ISP's web
server) is already set up with the proper MIME types. If the download
doesn't behave as you expect it to, ask your system
administrator to add the
<a name="INDEX-1168" />MIME types:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">audio/x-mpeg   .mpeg, .mpg, .mp3
audio/x-mpegurl   .m3u</pre></blockquote>

<p>Note that other MIME types also are commonly used for
<a name="INDEX-1169" />MP3 files, but they are technically
illegal. Make sure you're using
<em class="emphasis">audio/x-mpeg</em> and not
<em class="emphasis">audio/mpeg</em>. The server software may need to be
restarted for the new MIME types to take effect. Consult your server
software's documentation to see how to map MIME types to
filename extensions if you're not sure how all of this works.
There are dozens of servers for many different operating systems, and
it would be impossible to give you blanket guidelines on MIME
configuration here.

<h3 class="sect2">8.5.1. Creating your own MP3 site</h3>

<p>Because it is so easy to post
<a name="INDEX-1170" />MP3 files and serve them to the Internet
public, you may think that there is nothing else to do. However,
there are a couple of considerations to take into account before
building your MP3 site.
</p>

<p>First of all, if you plan on hosting your own MP3 site, you may want
to set up your own <a name="INDEX-1171" />FTP server because of the increased
control and security features it affords over HTTP. With an FTP
server, you can limit the permissions and access that a user has to
your database of MP3 files. For instance, you may wish to allow users
to download only a certain number of files. Likewise, you may opt to
use the strategy that many others have employed, which involves
allowing so many downloads for every upload. The usual ratio is
somewhere around three downloads allowed for every valid upload
received. In this way, the size and depth of a site like this will
continue to grow without the site creator being the sole entity
responsible for adding new music. In this way, the site will become
self-perpetuating by its very nature. Note, however, that while you
control the files you contribute to the site and can make sure
they're legal, it becomes quite difficult to check for and
enforce the copyright legality of files contributed by others.
</p>

<p>The main difference between hosting a web site
<a name="INDEX-1172" />and
an FTP server is that an FTP server offers specific features to
control access and upload/download permissions. There is a lot of
information out there on setting up FTP server software. You'll
find listings of other popular FTP sites at
<a href="../../../../../../www.mp3.lycos.com/">http://www.mp3.lycos.com</a> and
<a href="../../../../../../www.2look4.com/">http://www.2look4.com</a>. Another helpful web site,
complete with FTP software and configuring information, can be found
at <a href="../../../../../../www.jgaa.com/">http://www.jgaa.com</a>.
</p>

<p>Popular web and FTP server software for various operating systems are
listed in <a href="ch08_05.htm">Table 8-2</a> (search your favorite software
library for these if they aren't included with your OS). Far
more options are available than are listed here -- these are just
some starting points.

<p>Once you have your MP3 files and/or FTP site ready for prime time,
you can advertise and make them available to the world via some of
the popular MP3 repositories. If you don't have the resources
to host your own files and would like an excellent listing, register
your original works with MP3.com.
<a name="INDEX-1180" />MP3 search engines such as Lycos
(<a href="../../../../../../mp3.lycos.com/">http://mp3.lycos.com</a>) or 2look4
(<a href="../../../../../../www.2look4.com/">http://www.2look4.com</a>)
<a href="" /><a name="INDEX-1181" />are also excellent resources,
featuring numerous MP3 files and FTP site listings. 2look4 even
allows you to add your FTP site to its archive of MP3 sites.
<a name="INDEX-1182" />MP3now
(<a href="../../../../../../www.mp3now.com/">http://www.mp3now.com</a>) has a listing of the top
20 MP3 download sites. However, these sites list legal as well as
illegal sites, and the success rate of finding MP3 files may be
adversely affected since pirated illegal sites have a short lifespan.
If you are looking for a more traditional record company persona,
<a name="INDEX-1183" />Emusic (formerly Good
Noise), the Internet record company at
<a href="../../../../../../www.emusic.com/">http://www.emusic.com</a>, may suit your needs.
Emusic is one of the first online sites to offer MP3 files for
purchase.
</p>

<p>If you choose to create your own MP3 web site in order to promote
your band's work, you may want to consider an alternative to
normal MP3 downloads. Imagine, for instance, a web site for a garage
band. If they simply post full-length, full-quality, 4.5 MB files of
all their songs, they may not have many listeners. Who wants to
download 4.5 megs of an unknown quantity? One alternative is to
provide streaming files -- possibly RealAudio, Flash/Shockwave, or
streaming MP3s -- so that users can start hearing the music as
soon as the download begins. If they like what they hear, they can
choose to download the full files. Another possibility is to put up
samples of each track, say 20 seconds long, that will provide a
high-quality sound bite of the band's music. Even though these
MP3 files are small in comparison to the original files, they still
require downloading time. For fast quality, simplicity, and quick
access, consider streaming your
<a name="INDEX-1184" />MP3
files, a technology we'll <a name="INDEX-1185" />cover in the next section.
