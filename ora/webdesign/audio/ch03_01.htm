<p>The challenge to good recording is reproducing as accurately as possible a sound source without introducing system noise, distortion, or other unwanted artifacts. In theory, capturing sound is a relatively simple process: set up a microphone, run it through a microphone pre-amp or a mixing console, connect the output to a sound card or a digital tape machine, adjust the input level, and press record. 
</p>
<p>In the real world, however, good recording is complicated by elements
such as wind, crowd noise, poor room reflections, sudden volume
peaks, and the wide tonal range of musical instruments and voices.
The tools for preventing or overcoming these obstacles are proper
equipment and good recording techniques.
</p>

<p>Whether you are adding rollover sound effects, background music
loops, or narration to your site, the first step is to gather your
source material. Music and sound effects can be collected easily from
prerecorded, royalty-free music or sound effects libraries. However,
if you are recording voice-over narration, a live concert, or an
on-location interview, you will have to record the sound yourself.
</p>

<h2 class="sect1">3.1. Selecting the right equipment</h2>

<p>Using the appropriate equipment helps you produce high-quality audio.
<a name="INDEX-235" />Resolution is the
key difference between low-end and high-end <a name="INDEX-236" />audio gear.
Professional-grade audio equipment captures higher fidelity sound and
preserves the subtleties and nuances of the original source without
adding unwanted system noise or distortion.
</p>

<p>Applying solid recording techniques is more important than simply
buying expensive equipment, however. Get the highest-quality gear
your budget allows, then learn how each piece operates so you get the
best possible signal. In this section, we'll examine the
following types of equipment:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Microphones</p>
</li><li>
<p>Microphone pre-amps </p>
</li><li>
<p>Mixers</p>
</li><li>
<p>Compressors and limiters</p>
</li><li>
<p>Studio reference speakers</p>
</li><li>
<p>DAT recorders</p>
</li><li>
<p>Headphones</p>
</li><li>
<p>Pop screens</p>
</li><li>
<p>High-quality cables</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you are in the market for any of this equipment, consult <a href="appa_01.htm">Appendix A, "Creating the Ultimate Web Sound Studio: Buyers Guide and Web Resources"</a> for our recommendations.
</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">You get what you pay for</h4>
<p>The dynamic range of audio equipment is the difference between the loudest sound the system can record before distortion and the softest signal recorded without being overcome by the <em class="emphasis">noise floor</em>, the level of ambient noise in the recording. This range is measured by the <em class="emphasis">signal-to-noise ratio</em>. The <em class="emphasis">signal</em> is the actual sound you're after; <em class="emphasis">noise</em> is any hiss or other artifact introduced by the amplifier, the microphone, or the other electrical components of the audio system. High-end equipment produces a +95dB or greater signal-to-noise ratio, which introduces less system noise to your audio. Cheaper equipment produces a +80dB or lower signal-to-noise ratio, which introduces more noise.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">3.1.1. Microphones</h3>

<p>Selecting a
<a name="INDEX-237" />
<a name="INDEX-238" />microphone
suitable for your recording situation is crucial to capturing a good
signal -- and one of the best ways to meet the recording
challenges you will face out in the field where you can't
control background noise. The two factors to consider when choosing a
microphone are:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Its transducer design, or the method of converting sound waves into
electrical waveforms
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Its directionality, or pick-up pattern of surrounding sounds </p>
</li></ul>
<a name="sound-CHP-3-SECT-1.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.1.1.1. Tranducer designs</h3>

<p>A transducer is a device that changes information from one form to
another. A microphone is a type of transducer device that converts
sound waveforms into electrical waveforms, as shown in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Figure 3-1</a>. There are three main transducer designs for
microphones:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Dynamic microphones</p>
</li><li>
<p>Condenser microphones</p>
</li><li>
<p>Lavaliere clip-on microphones</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 class="sect3">3.1.1.2. Dynamic microphones</h3>

<p>A <a name="INDEX-239" />
<a name="INDEX-240" />dynamic
microphone is recommended for <a name="INDEX-241" /> <a name="INDEX-242" />
<a name="INDEX-243" />live concerts and studio or radio
voice-overs. A <a name="INDEX-244" />Beyer dynamic microphone is shown in
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Figure 3-2</a>. Dynamic microphones are more suitable
for live recordings because of their durability and reliability.
Plus, they do not overload or distort as easily as condenser
microphones. They also tend to be less expensive than condensers, but
generally do not deliver the even response across all frequencies
needed in a studio recording. Unlike dynamic microphones, which
amplify certain frequency ranges more than others, condenser
microphones amplify all sounds across the frequency spectrum equally,
thus producing a more accurate reproduction of the original sound
source.

<h3 class="sect3">3.1.1.3. Condenser microphones</h3>

<p>For capturing a more accurate, "flat" signal, use a
<a name="INDEX-245" />
<a name="INDEX-246" />condenser
microphone. An <a name="INDEX-247" />Audio-Technica 4050 condenser mic
is shown in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Figure 3-3</a>. Condenser microphones are
better at reproducing the <a name="INDEX-248" />soft decays and subtle nuances of
quieter sounds and are widely used in studio recordings where noise
rejection and <a name="INDEX-249" />public
address (PA) feedback are not a concern. They are most commonly used
for recording <a name="INDEX-250" />acoustic instruments and
<a name="INDEX-251" />voices. A
good condenser microphone introduces less signal noise than a dynamic
microphone and more accurately reproduces the complete frequency
spectrum between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.
</p>
<a name="sound-CHP-3-FIG-3" /><div class="figure"><img height="336" alt="Figure 3-3" src="figs/aud.0303.gif" width="177" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 3-3. The Audio-Technica 4050 condenser microphone</h4>


<p>While we recommend a high-quality, all-purpose condenser microphone
for most <a name="INDEX-252" />studio recordings, a large
diaphragm condenser microphone can be too sensitive for extremely
loud, continuous sounds like those from an electric guitar. A less
sensitive dynamic microphone will pick up a smoother guitar sound
without capturing every little high-end crackle.
</p>

</div>

<a name="sound-CHP-3-SECT-1.1.4" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.1.1.4. Lavaliere clip-on microphones </h3>

<p>Thumbnail-size lavaliere microphones are inconspicuous and portable,
and can be easily placed close to the direct source of
someone's voice. They are commonly used for
<a name="INDEX-253" />video shoots and
<a name="INDEX-254" />television talk shows. Using a
<a name="INDEX-255" />
<a name="INDEX-256" />lavaliere clip-on microphone and a
hidden, portable <a name="INDEX-257" />DAT machine make the recording
process less intrusive to the subject.
</p>

<p>A lavaliere microphone does not work well for recording live concerts
or for <a name="INDEX-258" />ambient field recording. Another
disadvantage is that one mic can capture only one voice; capturing
multiple voices requires several lavaliere microphones and an
additional mixing board.
</p>

</div>

<a name="sound-CHP-3-SECT-1.1.5" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.1.1.5. Directionality and pick-up patterns</h3>

<p>All
<a name="INDEX-259" />
<a name="INDEX-260" />
<a name="INDEX-261" />
<a name="INDEX-262" />microphones
employ one or more of the four directionality or
<a name="INDEX-263" /> <a name="INDEX-264" />pick-up patterns. The four patterns
are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Omnidirectional</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-265" />Omnidirectional microphones capture
sounds equally from all angles. They are commonly used for recording
multiple instruments and voices.
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Bidirectional</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>B<a name="INDEX-266" />idirectional microphones capture
sounds directly in front and in back of the capsule. A bidirectional
mic is commonly used to record vocal duets or is placed above an
acoustic instrument. Bidirectional microphones reject sounds from the
sides, making them useful for situations where an unwanted source is
present at 90 degrees, for example. They can also exhibit what is
known as the <em class="emphasis">proximity effect</em>. Often employed by
radio DJs and singers, this effect amplifies the bass frequencies of
a voice as it gets closer to the microphone.
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Cardioid</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-267" />Cardioid microphones capture the
sounds directly in front of the capsule, providing maximum noise
rejection. Cardioid mics are used for live-concert vocal recording
and amplification because the pick-up pattern does not capture loud,
distortion-causing sounds such as those from a PA system. They also
amplify the bass frequencies of a voice as it gets closer to the
microphone, creating the proximity effect.
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Shotgun</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-268" />Shotgun
microphones contain a recording capsule embedded in a long hollow
tube. The capsule picks up a highly exaggerated hypercardioid pattern
of sounds far in front and in back of the microphone. Shotgun mics
are used for recording in an environment where a narrow pick-up range
is needed, such as an interview conducted in a car.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Certain recording situations call for the use of different
<a name="INDEX-269" />pick-up patterns. For example, using
a cardioid microphone is more effective than an omnidirectional
microphone when interviewing someone on a busy tradeshow floor. If,
however, you wanted to capture the atmosphere and ambience of the
tradeshow, the omnidirectional mic grabs all the surrounding sounds
more evenly.
</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Recording versus amplification</h4>
<p>It is not always necessary to record a performance with the same microphones used to amplify the performance to the audience. If you use separate microphones for recording, feedback becomes a non-issue and you are free to select from a wider range of more sensitive condenser microphones.</p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>For an on-the-street interview, use a shotgun microphone that has a
hypercardioid pick-up pattern. A shotgun mic allows for broader
rejection of sounds outside its narrow pick-up range. A live
<a name="INDEX-270" />vocal performance might call for a
cardioid dynamic microphone with a limited pick-up range; this type
of mic should eliminate feedback created when a microphone
re-amplifies the amplified sounds coming from a PA system.
</p>

<p><a href="ch03_01.htm">Figure 3-4</a> illustrates the area of maximum pick-up
of the four most common patterns. Remember, all microphones pick up a
small amount of sound outside of their respective pick-up patterns.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-3-SECT-1.1.6" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.1.1.6. Frequency response</h3>

<p>Very few
<a name="INDEX-271" /> <a name="INDEX-272" />microphones have a uniform
frequency response. Most have bumps at various frequencies that add
coloration to the sound. Dynamic cardioid microphones, often called
"voice or PA microphones," typically have a boost in the
2 kHz to 5 kHz region, as this frequency range seems to make words
easier to understand. Condenser microphones used for recording and
music microphones are generally flatter, but have enough coloration
to make the proper match of mic-to-instrument -- a critical part
of the recording art.
</p>

<p>Some microphones have switches to change the frequency response. A
common switch is to a low-frequency cut that reduces the proximity
effect on a cardioid mic or low freqency rumble on a condenser mic.
</p>

<p>When shopping for a
<a name="INDEX-273" />microphone, look for a model that
has a good high-frequency response and low noise. A high-quality mic
should capture the entire frequency spectrum from 20 Hz to 20 kHz
with a low 11dB of self noise. Inexpensive microphones generally only
capture the frequencies between 50 Hz to 15 kHz and add a noticeable
amount of noise to the audio signal. Microphones also come in
high-impedance and low-impedance versions.
<a name="INDEX-274" />Impedance is the
amount of opposition to current flow. High-impedance types usually
have single-conductor miniature phone plugs on an attached cable;
lowimpedance mics have three-prong "<a name="INDEX-275" />XLR" connectors. Good
microphones are invariably low-impedance. A high-impedance mic can be
used in a pinch, but it will hum if the cable is longer than two
meters.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-3-SECT-1.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.1.2. Microphone pre-amps</h3>

<p>When recording, you want the loudest sound, or the highest amplitude
point of a given passage of music or narration, to peak just under
the maximum input level. By maximizing your input levels, you ensure
that softer passages of music or quieter sounds stay well above the
noise floor. Several factors determine your target input level: the
loudness of the sound itself, the proximity of the microphone to the
sound source, and the quality of your <a name="INDEX-276" />microphone pre-amp.
</p>

<p>A good mic pre-amp boosts the weak output signal of a microphone
without introducing signal noise, just as a telescope magnifies the
image seen through its lens. Microphone output signals are inherently
weak and must be amplified before entering your sound card or
recorder. By amplifying the output signal to your sound card or tape
recorder, you improve the quality of your recording.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-3-SIDEBAR-3" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Optimizing your hard drive for recording and editing</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>When recording or playing back audio, it is imperative that you use
an optimized <a name="INDEX-277" />hard drive with a
<a name="INDEX-278" />seek time fast
enough to support audio data transfer rates. A seek time of 7.5 ms or
better is ideal. Generally speaking, you should always work from your
fastest, most reliable hard drive. Intensive editing and recording
requires frequent <a name="INDEX-279" />disk optimization. Using a
fragmented or slow hard drive may cause disk errors, skipping, or
failure to play back or record audio tracks. Most drives purchased
since 1996 are capable of writing and reading at a sustained rate of
180 KB per second or better, the necessary speed for recording and
playing back CD-quality audio.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>However, if your hard drive becomes
<a name="INDEX-280" />fragmented, the sustained data rate may
become too slow for audio playback. Sound files often are extremely
large and need contiguous, uninterrupted hard disk space upon which
to write large sound files. Using a separate, dedicated hard drive
for audio recording and playback allows for easy optimization. If you
only have one hard drive, you can avoid this problem by partitioning
the disk. Remember: the faster and cleaner the drive, the more
reliable the recording and playback of the sound.
</p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>Many sound cards have built-in mic pre-amp inputs for a microphone.
You should avoid using these <a name="INDEX-281" />internal pre-amps whenever possible.
Poor quality pre-amps add noise and low-level distortion to your
recording, especially when capturing soft or quiet sounds. For a
little extra investment, an external "outboard" mic
pre-amp will noticeably increase the quality of your audio,
especially if you are using an inexpensive sound card. Using a
separate outboard mic pre-amp ensures that you are delivering a loud,
or "hot," signal into your mixer or sound card. If you
use the built-in pre-amp, make sure your microphone is properly
placed -- approximately six inches from the source -- to get
the hottest signal possible.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-3-SECT-1.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.1.3. Mixers</h3>

<p>Audio <a name="INDEX-282" />
<a name="INDEX-283" />mixers blend or
mix several discrete audio sources into a composite mono or stereo
signal (hence the term "mixer). The mixer is the Grand Central
Station of the sound studio. In addition to blending sounds together,
<a name="INDEX-284" />
<a name="INDEX-285" />mixing boards
connect and route all the input and output signals from one component
to another. Mixers save you the hassle of patching together different
pieces of equipment for common, day-to-day studio tasks. They are
often used for routing output <a name="INDEX-286" />signals from a DAT machine, CD
player, or microphone into a sound card or recording device and then
back out to a set of studio reference speakers.
</p>

<p>Mixers generally contain built-in mic pre-amps and signal-processing
capabilities such as <a name="INDEX-287" />equalization.
For recording amplified or loud sounds, the built-in mixer mic
pre-amps are ordinarily adequate. We recommend using a dedicated one-
or two-channel outboard mic pre-amp for recording softer sounds, such
as <a name="INDEX-288" />
<a name="INDEX-289" />voice and acoustic instruments.
High-quality mic pre-amp components are expensive; manufacturers of
sub-$1,000 16- and 24-channel mixers therefore are less likely to use
high-grade components.
</p>

<p>The key specification of a mixing board is the
<a name="INDEX-290" />signal-to-noise ratio, measured in dB.
A good mixer with a +95dB signal-to-noise ratio or higher introduces
less noise into the signal than will a low-end mixer. To confirm
whether a mixer has low noise, plug in a pair of headphones or
reference speakers and turn up all the faders on the board without
turning on any sound. Then turn up the main output levels. If you
hear excessive hiss and noise, the mixer has a poor signal-to-noise
ratio. If you hear just a little hiss, or none at all, the mixer has
a good signal-to-noise ratio. This is the primary difference between
a $30,000 16-track mixer and a $1,500 16-track mixer.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">3.1.4. Compressors/limiters</h3>

<p>A compressor is used to even out and
<a name="INDEX-291" />compress
incoming audio signals that vary in dynamic range, such as a singer
going from a soft whisper to a resounding
scream.<a name="INDEX-292" /> In the
digital recording environment, a compressor improves sound quality
and prevents distortion by reducing the amplitude or volume of
incoming sounds that peak above the 0dB-distortion range. When loud
sounds that would otherwise cause distortion are reduced in amplitude
by the compressor, you can increase the input level of your
microphone to get a hotter recording signal.

<h4 class="objtitle">Old mics can still carry a note</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>What do Streisand and Van Halen have in common? Obviously it is not
their style of music. But it is their choice of microphone. According
to <em class="emphasis">The Wall Street Journal</em>, Barbra and Eddie both swear by mics made
almost a half-century ago by the renowned electronics guru Georg
<a name="INDEX-293" />Neumann.
"The older, the better," according to Van Halen. When the
band goes into a recording studio, they use a number of classic
Neumann mics as well as vintage AKG Acoustics mics made in Vienna.
Barbra won't record without a 1950s edition
<a name="INDEX-294" />Neumann M49 because, according to
the original "Babs," the mic "makes the sound feel
warmer."
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>So why are these old mics finding new life in the new millennium?
Film-score mixer Shawn <a name="INDEX-295" />Murphy, whose music credits include
mega-hits <em class="emphasis">Star Wars</em> and <em class="emphasis">Saving Private Ryan</em>, says he prefers a
Neumann M50 mic because "there just isn't anything
manufactured today that does as good a job." And you
won't find better harmony than in the words music producers use
to describe these old mics -- warm, alive, rhapsodic, and amazing,
to name just a few.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>While newer mics have a dedicated following, when most musicians
rave, they rave about the old mic they have procured for their next
recording session. And these vintage mics, which used to cost in the
hundreds of dollars, are now going for many thousands. For example,
the University of Southern California purchased a
<a name="INDEX-296" />Neumann U67 for its audio lab at a
cost of $3,500. This for a mic made in the early 1960s that when new,
sold for less than $200. The <a name="INDEX-297" />AKG ELA M251, which cost less than
$300 in 1960 now can fetch as much as $15,000. Typically, these
vintage mics sell for much more than new high-end models, which cost
between $3,000 and $5,000. This presents a dilemma for companies like
Neumann and AKG -- while it is complimentary to their consistent
high-quality manufacturing, it is discomfiting to a business model
when many customers prefer the old product to your new stuff.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>So what is it about these old mics that has studio executives and
musicians alike bucking the digital trend? The new models are just as
well-designed as the older Neumanns and AKGs. In fact, newer mics are
capable of giving off less signal noise and producing higher fidelity
than their older counterparts. The answer may lie in the way the old
mics were assembled, with simple electronic circuits built by
hand -- a manufacturing process that isn't suitable in
today's competitive marketplace. But a better explanation may
be the "coolness factor." As music producer Brendan
O'Brien put it, "they look like what Frank Sinatra
used."
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>So if you are charged with recording new material for your
company's web site, and you've got the budget for it,
take a new look at some old mics.

<p>High-quality<a name="INDEX-298" /> studio reference speakers accurately

<p>Just as every computer monitor screen displays colors differently,
every brand of studio reference speakers produces a slightly
different sound. The most important thing is to use the same set of

<h3 class="sect2">3.1.8. Pop screens</h3>

<p>Pop screens are essential for recording voices in the studio. A
<a name="INDEX-306" />pop screen is a
circular hoop with a thin nylon covering that sits directly between
the speaker's mouth and the microphone. Without it, your
recording likely will include wind and breath noises, such as
explosive "P" words. <a href="ch03_01.htm">Figure 3-5</a> shows a
typical pop screen setup. Most music stores carry them. In a pinch,
you can get away with a homemade screen. Take some stocking hose and
stretch it over a framing device, such as a bent metal clothes hanger
or an embroidery hoop, and tape it to the mic stand with duct tape.

<h3 class="sect2">3.1.9. High-quality cables</h3>

<p>Cables are the last item anyone wants to spend money on, but since
they carry all your vital electrical signals, it is worth the extra
expense to buy high-quality
<a name="INDEX-307" />cables with reinforced connectors
and proper shielding. Cheap, poor-quality cables produce noise and
interference, and they frequently break.
