<p>Josh writes: Thanks to all of my friends, associates, and family who
have given me the support, encouragement, and wisdom to complete this
project. Special thanks to my wife, Laura Genant, who stood by with
patience and love during the many late nights spent over the past
three years writing this book. Much gratitude to my brothers, Ethan
Allen and Kevin and Breean Beggs, for their sage advice and support
along the way. Special thanks to j rain for all the words of wisdom.
And most important, my thanks to the power and spirit of making and
sharing music -- the source of my inspiration.
</p>

<p>Dylan writes: First and foremost, I give my thanks to God, who has
inspired me all through my life. Many thanks go out to all the people
who helped directly and indirectly in the creation of this book. It
is my honor to give thanks to my family, especially my mother, Anita,
my father, James, my grandmothers, Mary and Georgianne, and my
brothers, Jeremiah and Christian. My uncles, aunts, and cousins, from
California to Illinois, from New Jersey to Italy, and beyond. And to
Amy Bradburn, who has inspired me to heights unimaginable. As for my
extended family and friends, the list is long and the appreciation
could probably fill a book in itself. The families of Thede, Ruffalo,
Burgat, Manchester, Yurino, Huizenga, Robinson, Degenshein,
D'Agostino, Pio, Neilson, Karst, Ruiz, Solomon, Brown,
Reynolds, Barone, Stone, Macchia, Berkeley, Santa Cruz, Claremont,
UCSC, UC Berkeley. The list goes on and my apologies if any are
omitted. So many people who have given so much to me during my years
and have inevitably been part of this project and all that I do. My
heartfelt thanks to all of you. Last and certainly most of all, I
wish to thank my co-author and lifelong friend, Josh Beggs. Josh, you
are a talented individual and a true friend indeed!
</p>

<p>Much love and many thanks to you all.</p>
