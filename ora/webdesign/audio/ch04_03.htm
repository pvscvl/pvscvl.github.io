<h2 class="sect1">4.3. Web mastering: optimizing sound files for Internet broadcasting</h2>

<p><em class="emphasis">Mastering</em> refers to the process of preparing a
group of sound files (i.e., music tracks of a CD) for final delivery
in one uniform manner, medium, and level of quality. This means that
each sound file has little unwanted noise and shares the same
relative decibel (volume) levels and equalization characteristics
with the rest of the audio files.
</p>

<p>The practical reason for
<a name="INDEX-414" />mastering groups
of sound files is to prevent people from having to continually adjust
the volume and equalization settings of their sound system or
computer each time a new song or sound passage is played. For
example, it is generally undesirable to have one song where the bass
guitar frequencies stand out in the mix and another song where the
bass frequencies are relatively quiet. Nor would you want to have one
voice-over track significantly louder than the following voice-over
track. Mastering helps to balance each song and sound file so the mix
or web soundtrack is consistent. Mastering also disguises the sonic
variation between songs that may have been recorded in different
environments or recording studios.
</p>

<p>Mastering for the Web is the final optimization process before
converting sound files to their respective web formats. The main web
mastering tools you'll work with are normalization,
compression, and equalization. Achieved with a sound editor,
normalization helps guarantee that your files share the same relative
loudness and optimal dynamic range for web conversion. Additional
compression of the sound file with a compressor or peak limiter
effect ensures the highest fidelity when converting to low-bandwidth
formats with reduced bit-depths and sampling rates.Equalization (EQ) ensures the tonal
consistency and quality between all the sound files you will
incorporate into your web site.

<h3 class="sect2">4.3.1. Normalization: maximizing the dynamic range</h3>

<p>If<a name="INDEX-415" />
<a name="INDEX-416" /> you are
working with prerecorded material, the next step is to
<em class="emphasis">normalize</em> your sound files before converting
them to web formats. Normalization maximizes the bit-depth
information available and provides consistent
<a name="INDEX-417" />volume levels across all your web
pages. It's important to maintain volume consistency among
different sound clips; there's nothing quite as jarring as
experiencing dramatic shifts in volume when clicking through a web
site. Normalization corrects this problem by raising all sounds to
one uniform standard amplification level.
</p>

<p>Normalization raises the overall amplitude or loudness level of a
sound file to the point where the loudest peak is just below
clipping, while also boosting the entire signal evenly, including the
noise, as shown in <a href="ch04_03.htm">Figure 4-11</a>.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-FIG-11" /><div class="figure"><img height="392" alt="Figure 4-11" src="figs/aud.0411.gif" width="402" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-11. A waveform before and after normalization</h4>

<p><a name="INDEX-418" />Normalization makes maximum use of the
<a name="INDEX-419" />dynamic range
within the bit-depth of a digital audio signal, but it does not
effect the dynamic range of the source audio. In other words, the
dynamic range between softest and loudest material in the sound file
is unaffected after normalizing, but the sound file is louder
overall.
</p>

<p>Using a <em class="emphasis">compressor</em> or "look-ahead"
<em class="emphasis">peak limiter</em>
while<a name="INDEX-420" />
<a name="INDEX-421" /> normalizing
your sound files produces better results than simple normalization
alone, as shown in <a href="ch04_03.htm">Figure 4-12</a>. Compressors and peak
limiters reduce the highest peaks or waveforms in your sound
files,<a name="INDEX-422" />
<a name="INDEX-423" /> thereby allowing you to further
boost the volume of softer sounds. Increasing the volume of the
waveforms within a sound file allows you to maximize the dynamic
range when converting to low bit-rate web
<a name="INDEX-424" />codecs.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-FIG-12" /><div class="figure"><img height="386" alt="Figure 4-12" src="figs/aud.0412.gif" width="402" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-12. A standard normalized waveform (top) and a compressed and normalized waveform (bottom)</h4>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Three reasons to normalize your sound files</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>First, normalization maximizes the bit-depth information available by giving a sound a louder overall presence.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, it provides volume consistency across multiple web pages or sound files.</p></li>
<li><p>The third reason for normalization is to prevent distortion when encoding a stereo file into a single-channel mono file. If you are converting stereo files into low-bandwidth mono files, you should normalize to roughly 70% of the signal level of your input source. If you do not normalize a stereo file during or prior to its conversion to a mono file, you may experience digital distortion in your output file when the signals are combined and shoot above the maximum 0db level.</p></li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>To normalize a file, <a name="INDEX-425" />SoundEdit
16 (or the editor you are using) examines the entire waveform, or a
selection of the sound file, and finds the highest peak that any one
sound makes in the given selection. The normalization dialog box,
shown in <a href="ch04_03.htm">Figure 4-13</a>, then calculates the distance
from that highest peak upwards towards the zero decibel (0dB) level.
This distance is known as
"<a name="INDEX-426" />headroom."
The 0dB level is the highest level that sound can go in the digital
world without "peaking the meters" and causing massive
<a name="INDEX-427" />distortion in the sound. Remember not
to confuse digital distortion with analog distortion.
<a name="INDEX-428" />
<a name="INDEX-429" />Analog
distortion may sound good at times, producing interesting harmonics
and tones such as those heard in classic rock-and-roll guitar solos.
But digital distortion produces clicks and pops and nearly always
sounds terrible.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-FIG-13" /><div class="figure"><img height="84" alt="Figure 4-13" src="figs/aud.0413.gif" width="175" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-13. In the Normalization window you can select the amount of 
normalization you want. Generally, 95% is a safe number for encoding
to web formats</h4>

<p>When normalizing an audio file,
<a name="INDEX-430" />SoundEdit 16 knows to avoid digital
distortion and therefore will not make any sound greater than the 0dB
cut-off point. Once it calculates the distance between the highest
waveform peak and the 0dB cut-off point, SoundEdit 16 determines the
number between the two and increases the rest of the sound
file's waveforms by that amount. The overall effect increases
all the levels equally without creating digital distortion at any
point in the selection.
</p>

<p>You can normalize an entire sound file or just a portion of it. To
normalize part of a sound file, highlight only a specific region of
the waveform. If no region is highlighted, SoundEdit 16 normalizes
the entire file.
</p>

<p>You can also set the amount of normalization you want based on a
percentage of the maximum (100%). To be safe, you should try
normalizing your files at 95% or -3dB below zero to allow for extra
headroom, as shown in <a href="ch04_03.htm">Figure 4-14</a>. Flash and
RealAudio, for example, have a tendency to distort certain sound
files or frequencies that are normalized above 95%.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-FIG-14" /><div class="figure"><img height="224" alt="Figure 4-14" src="figs/aud.0414.gif" width="400" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-14. The top audio file represents the audio waveform before normalization and the bottom waveform represents the audio file after normalization (set to 95% or -3dB below 0).</h4>

<p>Normalization is an important step to achieving high-quality web
audio. By maximizing your dynamic range, your audio files will sound
dramatically better when they are reduced to 8-bit sounds for the
Web, especially for analog modem delivery. The dynamic range of lower
bit-depth audio files is extremely limited, so softer sounds and
quiet decays cannot be completely reproduced in an 8-bit sound clip.
If you want the nuances of your sound design to be heard in
<a name="INDEX-431" />low bit-depth audio, they cannot be
subtle; faint decays and soft sounds simply will not come through.

<h3 class="sect2">4.3.2. Compression: reducing sound peaks and spikes</h3>

<p>Using <a name="INDEX-432" />
<a name="INDEX-433" />
<a name="INDEX-434" />simple
normalization alone to maximize the dynamic range has several
limitations and drawbacks. Because the normalization process
calculates only the available headroom, you are limited by the
proximity of the loudest peak to the maximum 0dB cut-off point, as
shown in <a href="ch04_03.htm">Figure 4-15</a>.
</p>

<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Compressing film sound</h4>
<p>When encoding for the web, audio that has either too strong or too weak a signal will have a negative impact on the output quality of the particular file. Some content, especially film content, uses extreme dynamic ranges to accentuate the emotion created by the content. Unfortunately, this dynamic causes negative results when encoded, causing previously unheard noise in the quiet parts and distortion in the loud parts. We suggest using some mild compression in order to help the encoder best deal with the source audio.</p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>Generally, all sound files have a few short volume peaks or spikes,
whether they are from a loud guitar solo section or a particular
voice passage that is louder than adjacent sounds. Simple
normalization is not effective if there is already a peak just under
the maximum 0dB cut-off point. You can use a peak limiter or the
amplify/gain process in SoundEdit 16 to further maximize the fidelity
of audio playback over the web. A <a name="INDEX-435" />peak limiter is a dynamics processor
that limits or prevents signals from peaking above a specified
amplitude level. The average levels of your sound file can be raised
several dB beyond the regular normalization level by using a limiter
to compress the highest volume peaks. Likewise, you can use an
amplify/<a name="INDEX-436" />gain
command to reduce the level of a particular spike in your waveform.
</p>


<p>By reducing these identified peaks, the entire level of the file can
be raised higher before reaching the 0dB cut-off, resulting in a
higher average signal level. You can achieve this function manually,
by visually examining the sound file and locating and reducing
individual peaks using the <a name="INDEX-437" />amplify/gain command.
</p>

<p>You can also use a peak limiter plug-in, such as Wave's L1
Maximizer, to reduce the amplitude peaks in your sound files. The
<a name="INDEX-438" />L1 Maximizer works by compressing all
sounds that peak above the threshold setting of the dB level that you
specify. The lower the threshold point, the more the sound is
compressed. Generally 3dB to 9dB of compression adds clarity and
brilliance to the sound and produces an overall effect that is
pleasing to the ears. However, be careful not to overcompress your
sound files. Too much compression (over 12dB) may make your sound
files seem unnatural and "harsh" to your listeners'
ears.
</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Warning!</h4>
<p>If you want to boost frequencies, you should use equalization before you normalize or compress your sound file. If you normalize or compress your sound up to the maximum 0db cut-off point, and then increase the amplitude of certain frequencies, you will cause distortion.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">4.3.3. Equalization: customizing your sound</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-439" />Equalization is one of the most powerful
tools you can use to enhance audio quality. Through the process of
equalization<em class="emphasis">,</em> you can increase or amplify any
specified range of frequencies within that spectrum. Equalizing files
destined for the Web can help compensate for lost or reduced
frequencies resulting from the drastic file-size reduction and
conversion process used to prepare sound files for analog modem
delivery. For instance, sound files formatted for 28.8 or 56 Kbps
modems lose most of their high-end frequencies. Most web formats
reduce the sample rate, limiting the use of high frequencies.
</p>

<p><a href="ch04_03.htm">Figure 4-16</a> illustrates an EQ boost in the low-end
bass frequencies between 75 Hz and 110 Hz and the high-range vocal
frequencies between 2,000 Hz and 7,000 Hz to add brightness to a mix
and make the vocals more clear after web conversion.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-FIG-16" /><div class="figure"><img height="373" alt="Figure 4-16" src="figs/aud.0416.gif" width="400" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-16. Equalization boost of the 75-200 Hz and the 2,000-7,000 Hz ranges</h4>

<p>Often your final web audio sounds better if you eliminate high
frequencies first. For instance, if you are reducing the sample rate
to 22 Kbps, cut the frequencies over 10 Kbps. Frequencies above 10
Kbps create aliasing and other unwanted distortion artifacts when the
conversion process tries to represent them and cannot.
</p>

<p>There are two parameters you can specify to alter the equalization of
a sound: the
<a name="INDEX-440" />amplitude
level and the <a name="INDEX-441" />bandwidth range of the frequencies.
The amplitude level determines the loudness of a given range of
frequencies. The bandwidth (usually from 200 to 500 Hz) determines
the range of frequencies being amplified or reduced. Generally, you
are never boosting or reducing one single frequency but instead a
range of frequencies.
</p>

<p>You may have used an equalizer on your home or professional sound
systems. Equalizers generally have sliding levers, known as
<a name="INDEX-442" />faders, that
represent the different ranges of frequencies between 20 Hz (low) and
20,000 Hz (high) -- the normal hearing range of a human.
<a name="INDEX-443" />Home sound
system EQs generally feature five to ten faders or bands of EQ
starting at the 50 to 120 Hz range on up to the 8,000 Hz to 10,000 Hz
range. A professional
<a name="INDEX-444" />equalizer features 20 or more
separate bands of EQ starting as low as 20 Hz to 60 Hz and going as
high as 16,000 Hz to 20,000 Hz. To increase, or boost, the relative
amplitude of each range of the frequency spectrum, select the
corresponding fader and move it up until you are satisfied with the
relative amplitude or loudness of that frequency range. Likewise, if
you want to lower or cut sound in that frequency range, slide the
fader down.
</p>

</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>There are two types of EQ
interfaces:<a name="INDEX-445" />
<a name="INDEX-446" />
<a name="INDEX-447" />
graphic and parametric. A graphic equalizer is commonly featured on
home sound systems and "boom" boxes and is the easiest
and most popular form of equalization. A graphic equalizer contains
multiple sliding levers or faders along a horizontal line that
represents the different ranges of frequencies between 20 Hz and
20,000 Hz. To increase or decrease the amplitude of each frequency
range, move the fader up or down in a +10dB or -10dB range for best
results.
</p>

<p>A graphic equalizer is the easiest EQ interface to use especially for
beginners, but it's the least flexible for professionals.
Unlike a parametric EQ where the frequency bandwidth of each knob can
be adjusted, the faders on a graphic EQ affect a predetermined
bandwidth. For example, a 300 Hz fader on a five-band home sound
system EQ generally boosts the signal along a tapered arch starting
at 200 Hz on the low end, 300 Hz at the top, and 400 Hz on the high
end. This means that the fader is boosting a 200 Hz-wide range of
frequencies. Professionals demand more accuracy for precision
adjustments and thus tend to use parametric EQs instead.
</p>

<p>Because it requires a fairly deep understanding of audio theory, a
parametric equalizer is used primarily in professional applications.
Unlike a graphic equalizer, a parametric equalizer allows you to
specify the desired bandwidth range (50 Hz, 100 Hz, 500 Hz, etc.) and
the exact frequency (256 Hz, 1,350 Hz, 4,560 Hz, etc.) of the EQ
setting before boosting or reducing the amount of gain. Parametric
equalizers feature several twisting knobs for adjusting bandwidth and
gain instead of a horizontal row of faders. Certain applications
require boosting or reducing a more narrow or more broad range of
frequencies than a graphic equalizer allows for, making a parametric
equalizer ideal in these cases.

<a name="sound-CHP-4-SECT-3.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.3.4. Using EQ to enhance audio</h3>

<p>During the mastering process, <a name="INDEX-448" />equalization can enhance your
audio and compensate for unbalanced sound levels in two different
ways. First, equalization can be used to adjust the overall bass,
mid-range, or treble of a sound file. Second, it can be used to make
the overall bass, mid-range, and treble more uniform from song to
song or from sound file to sound file.
</p>

<p>To apply EQ to a sound file, first listen to it to see if it contains
one or more of the three most common EQ imbalances. The first is a
"muddy" or muffled sound with too much bass or "low
end" in the 100 to 800 Hz range. The second is an irritating or
"honky" sound from too much mid-range frequencies in the
1,000 to 5,000 Hz range. The last is a dull sound from not enough
bright, high-end frequencies in the 5,000 to 10,000 Hz range.
</p>

<p>Use equalization to "fatten" your sound by boosting the
low bass frequencies in the 40 to 200 Hz range, or conversely to
clean up a "muddy" sound file by reducing the low
frequencies in the 300 Hz range. Likewise, you can reduce the harsh
or "honky" mid-range tones by reducing sound in the 1,000
to 5,000 Hz range. Lastly, you can increase the brilliance and
clarity of a dull sound by boosting its high frequencies in the 5,000
to 10,000 Hz range, or to avoid unpleasant, sharp piercing sounds,
reduce super-high frequencies above 8,000 Hz.

<a name="sound-CHP-4-SECT-3.4.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.3.4.1. Removing sibilance</h3>

<p>Before you've completed the equalization process, it's a
good idea to remove some of the unneeded higher frequencies. For
example, you may have noticed that your voice-over contains many
"ssss" sounds and short P's and T's. This is
referred to as<a name="INDEX-449" /> <em class="emphasis">sibilance</em>. The
occurrences of sibilance can be lessened by cutting the levels of the
higher frequencies, as shown in <a href="ch04_03.htm">Figure 4-17</a>, or by
using a D<a name="INDEX-450" />e-esser
effects plug-in.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-FIG-17" /><div class="figure"><img height="259" alt="Figure 4-17" src="figs/aud.0417.gif" width="341" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-17. The Equalizer window allows you to reduce or cut-off high-end frequencies with the 1.2, 3.2, and 8.1 kHz faders.</h4>

<p>Reducing sibilance with EQ by cutting a selected range of high
frequencies should be a last resort effort. This technique decreases
the selected range of high frequencies across the entire sound file
producing a more dull sound. To avoid sibilance problems, deal with
the issue during the recording process. Run your incoming signal
through a De-esser digital processor or plug-in to remove sibilance
before the audio is written to disk or work with your voice talent to
produce less sibilance.
</p>

<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Cut the noise: Equalization for low bandwidth</h4>
<p>The audio encoding process accentuates background noises that you may not have noticed in the original audio source. Generally, the two areas to focus on are the highest 1/4 and lowest 1/4 of your audio frequencies.</p>
<p>The higher frequencies (above 10,000Hz) tend to carry a lot of the background noise, such as hiss and scratchiness, in an audio file. Meanwhile, the lower audio frequencies (below 75Hz) tend to carry a lot of the rumble that can occur from background noises such as H/VAC systems, or the microphone rumble caused by wind.</p> 
<p>To correct this problem, eliminate the low-end frequencies between 20 and 75Hz and the highest frequencies above 10,000Hz, using the equalization faders in your sound editor (i.e., high-pass low-pass filters). </p>

<h3 class="sect3">4.3.4.2. Using low-pass and high-pass filters</h3>

<p>You may find it useful to use the equalizer as a filter that removes
all sound in frequencies above a certain point. This is referred to
as a <a name="INDEX-451" />
<a name="INDEX-452" />
<a name="INDEX-453" />low-pass filter. This process allows
all the frequencies lower than a number you specify to
"pass" through, while any sound above the target
frequency is "filtered" out. Use the low-pass filter to
eliminate hiss entirely or to wholly remove sounds in the upper
frequencies. You can create a low-pass filter by simply sliding the
high-end frequency faders to the -20dB levels.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, there may be situations where you need to use a
high-pass filter. With a high-pass filter, you effectively remove
everything below your specified cut-off frequency and allow anything
higher to pass through. This is useful in removing lower bass sounds,
such as the rumble of an automobile engine or the sound of a jet
plane flying overhead.

<p>To remove lower <a name="INDEX-454" />bass sounds, you can
create a high-pass filter by taking the sliders below 510 Hz and
moving them down to the -20dB level, as shown in <a href="ch04_03.htm">Figure 4-18</a>. Again, these are only starting points. You
may wish to move some faders to -20db and keep some at -10dB, or
whatever combination sounds right to you. As with any process, trial
and error is how you find the sound you want. Try boosting or cutting
frequencies in order to hear the difference each movement of the
fader makes. Just remember to choose undo before you try a new
equalization or effect, so that the previous change isn't added
onto the new one you're trying out.
