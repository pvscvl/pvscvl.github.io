<h2 class="sect1">1.5. Audio challenges and limitations</h2>

<p>Audio formats do not have universal browser support, nor is there
widespread use of one particular format. Adoption of a single audio
format has been slow due to technical challenges that include browser
incompatibilities, severe bandwidth limitations, and unwieldy
plug-ins:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Lack of standards</b>.
<a name="INDEX-45" />The persistent incompatibilities between
the latest plug-in releases, combined with a marketplace flooded with
different versions of browsers, have left web designers yearning for
audio format standards. These concerns may eventually disappear as
older browsers go out of circulation and as more web surfers use
browsers supporting audio formats such as RealAudio, Flash, MP3, and
Beatnik.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Bandwidth limitations</b>.
<a name="INDEX-46" />With
the limited bandwidth of standard analog modems, web developers can
barely afford to have a full-featured graphic interface, let alone
the addition of bandwidth-intensive audio content. Building a web
soundtrack in restricted bandwidth conditions is difficult and
requires stringent use of graphics and audio content as well as some
ingenious workarounds. One such workaround is recycling a small
portion of a music loop clip to use as a button sound, as detailed in
<a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Interactive Sound Design with Flash and Shockwave"</a><em class="filename">.</em>
</p>

<p>Limited bandwidth also makes it difficult to work with many of the
current audio technologies. Shockwave and Flash are great tools for
creating interactive audio content with images and animation, but at
slow modem speeds, frames come jolting to a halt and audio frequently
drops out or skips ahead. The widespread use of high-speed digital
modems will alleviate these problems.
</p>

<p>Severe bandwidth limitations also significantly reduce audio quality.
Proper recording, editing, and encoding of audio files is especially
important with limited bandwidth conditions. This book provides the
information that will help you create high-quality audio files that
are optimized for web delivery.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Difficult plug-in installation
procedures</b>.
<a name="INDEX-47" />The process of downloading and
installing an audio plug-in is problematic for technically savvy
computer users, but for novices, the process presents a whole new
level of challenges. Downloading a plug-in disrupts the viewing
experience, forces users to answer difficult technical questions, and
generally remains far too complicated. In a professional environment
that demands quality and reliability, using plug-in-dependent
technology for critical content is risky at best. RealNetworks and
Macromedia are in the process of developing technical solutions and
marketing deals for making the plug-in download process easier. You
can read more about the advantages of
<a name="INDEX-48" />Macromedia's
Smart-Shockwave and <a name="INDEX-49" />Aftershock plug-in download solutions in
<a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Interactive Sound Design with Flash and Shockwave"</a>. Installing plug-ins is easier in
<a name="INDEX-50" />IE5 and Netscape 5, but
neither browser is ubiquitous.

<h4 class="objtitle">Sound advice tips from the sound designer of the film Titanic
</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>Gary Rydstrom, Academy Award-winning sound designer for <em class="emphasis">Jurassic
Park</em>, <em class="emphasis">Terminator 2</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Titanic</em>, provides seven common film
<a name="INDEX-51" />sound
design techniques that also pertain to designing sound for a web
site:
</p>
&nbsp;
<ul><li>
<p>Pay attention to the sounds around you in your everyday life. Imagine
how you would recreate them with effects.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p>Focus on sounds that have the highest emotional impact. Use sounds
that help build and strengthen the character and theme of your web
site.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p>Use silence in your soundtrack.
<a name="INDEX-52" />Remember when adding sound to your
web pages that you also have the benefit of visual content to carry
meaning.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p>The audio elements of your presentation should have a harmonious
<a name="INDEX-53" />rhythm or pattern when played in
sequence. If you have a good sense of rhythm and timing, you can be a
good sound designer.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p>Keep your soundtrack varied. Do not use the same monotonous synth
drone or music loop on every web page in your site. People quickly
tune out repetitive sounds. <a name="INDEX-54" />
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p>Keep your soundtrack simple. Do not let it get too busy with
distracting sounds; the soundtrack should pull you into the content
of the web page. Only one or two sounds should be dominant in the mix
at any given time.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p>Try to orchestrate the sounds in your mix so that they use the entire
frequency spectrum of bass, mid-range, and high-pitched tones. Avoid
the simultaneous use of sounds that fill the same frequency range,
such as a mid-range voice and cello or a bass guitar and baritone
male voice.
