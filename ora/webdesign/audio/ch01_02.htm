<h2 class="sect1">1.2. What you can do with sound on the Web</h2>

<p>The advent of web audio opens up more channels for information
delivery with narration, interviews, music, sound effects, and radio
broadcasts. Among a huge list of benefits, <a name="INDEX-4" />web
audio can be used to:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Communicate ideas through informative dialogue, narration, and voice
content<a name="INDEX-5" />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Improve site navigation with interface-oriented sound effects such as
audio button rollover
cues<a name="INDEX-6" />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enliven your entertainment content and presentations with background
music<a name="INDEX-7" />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Generate revenue through online music sales and distribution of
digitized audio
clips<a name="INDEX-8" />
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Here are some of the ways audio can effectively be used in web site
development:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Webcasts</b>.<a name="INDEX-9" /><a name="INDEX-10" />Local
radio stations are widening their audience base (and their
advertising appeal) by simulcasting on the Internet. Every major
league baseball game is broadcast live around the world.
<a name="INDEX-11" />Concert
promoters are using webcasting as a major promotional and
distribution scheme. Consider for
example<a name="INDEX-12" /> NetAid, a
multinational series of concerts and webcasts designed to raise funds
for people in developing countries. The NetAid Foundation and the UN
Development Program view webcasts as a way to build visibility for
their web sites, which will serve as a primary, long-term fundraising
vehicle. (It should be noted, however, that the concerts were webcast
on the cutting-edge
<a name="INDEX-13" />Internet2, and not
the freely available Web. However, Internet users were able to
download some footage in RealMedia format.)
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Web soundtracks</b>.<a name="INDEX-14" />Audio can greatly
<a name="INDEX-15" />enhance
your online multimedia presentations. As more sites incorporate
Macromedia's Flash technology (see <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "Interactive Sound Design with Flash and Shockwave"</a> for more information) or RealNetwork's
G2 technology with SMIL, a new standard multimedia markup language
(see <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "Designing Multimedia Presentations with SMIL and RealSystem G2"</a>), audio is becoming an integral
component to animation, graphics, and text on the Web.
<a name="INDEX-16" />
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">E-commerce</b>.<a name="INDEX-17" />Online
record stores<a name="INDEX-18" /> such as CDNow, Tower Records, Music
Boulevard, eMusic, and MP3.com as well as thousands of small,
independent record labels and musicians broadcast free streaming
audio previews as a shopping service to their customers. Making
<a name="INDEX-19" />album clips
available as samples often leads a customer to purchase the CD. These
on-demand music clips not only allow users to try before they buy,
but they are also a powerful tool for helping an online store to sell
more.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">On-demand audio
archives</b>.<a name="INDEX-20" /> <a name="INDEX-21" />You
can use the Web to affordably categorize and rebroadcast audio
content such as sounds effects, speech files, educational content,
and even music clips targeted at specialized audiences. For example,
<a href="../../../../../../bobdylan.com/">bobdylan.com</a> offers exclusive
unreleased material available only from the web site. If the
customers are diehard Dylan fans, these on-demand audio exclusives
will keep them coming back.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Voice-over narration</b>.<a name="INDEX-22" />Like webcasts and interviews,
<a name="INDEX-23" />rechanneling
text explanations into voice-over narration frees up the visual
elements to do other jobs within the site. Narration can enable more
interactive storytelling. For navigational and educational purposes,
narration can also serve as a guide through the site or through a
tutorial.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Content layers</b>.<a name="INDEX-24" /> <a name="INDEX-25" />There is only so much information a user
can absorb at once. Splitting up or layering content and funneling
some of it through an audio track reduces the amount of information
to scroll through. Some sites tack on sound bites as column sidebars.
C|net's <em class="emphasis">News.com</em> (<a href="../../../../../../news.cnet.com/news/0-1002.html">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1002.html</a>) offers a
more ambitious approach to divvying up its content: it broadcasts top
stories with three daily webcasts. Readers can browse the rest of the
site while a six- to twelve-minute audio show continues in the
background. You can also include advertising spots in a webcast. They
are less obtrusive than a rotating banner ad, but still get the URL
out to the audience.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b class="emphasis-bold">Audio interviews</b>.
<a name="INDEX-26" />
<a name="INDEX-27" />Another
way to layer a large amount of content is with audio interviews.
Instead of scrolling through lengthy Q &amp; A documents like the
author interviews at <a href="../../../../../../www.amazon.com/">http://www.amazon.com/</a>,
for example, users get the information more quickly while working on
other things. Because users are hearing the insider's actual
voice, the audio also adds personality and makes the content more
robust and enjoyable. <a name="INDEX-28" />
