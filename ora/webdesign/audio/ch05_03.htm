<h2 class="sect1">5.3. Selecting the right format</h2>

<p>Each format discussed in this chapter has
<a name="INDEX-606" />
<a name="INDEX-607" />advantages and disadvantages
depending on the requirements of your project. There is no single
format appropriate for every situation. To determine which format is
best for you, first identify your needs, then select the format that
best suits those needs. There are huge differences in server
requirements for broadcasting CD-quality music to a limited audience
versus wide-scale broadcasting to a large audience with diverse
bandwidth capacity. Similarly, the differences between authoring and
delivering interactive content such as a game or product demo versus
encoding and broadcasting a video file are completely different.
</p>

<p>RealAudio, MP3, and Flash are familiar names, but a host of
alternative formats, including Windows Media, RMF, and Liquid Audio
might better suit your needs. Let's take a look at the factors
that will determine the most appropriate format for you.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.1. Interactive sound design capabilities </h3>

<p>Before you look at browser compatibility, cost, audio fidelity, and
server performance, you will need to determine whether you need a
format that supports interactive presentations or one that supports
continuous playback of audio and video files. Several formats such as
Flash, Shockwave, and Beatnik are designed for rich interactive media
content such as games, educational material, product demos, and
promotional pieces where instantaneous feedback via sound effects are
essential.
</p>

<p>In contrast, formats such as RealMedia, MP3, Windows Media, and
QuickTime are primarily designed for continuous playback of audio and
video files where server-side bandwidth negotiation and management
are key. When they do support interactivity, it is usually in a more
limited form such as slide shows and synchronized sound with video or
text.
</p>

<p>First, determine whether you want a format for delivering interactive
content or simply a format for encoding and broadcasting audio and
video files, then let the following criteria guide your final
decision.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-3.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.2. Browser compatibility</h3>

<p>Let's face it, if people do not have the plug-in or technology
to view or listen to your content, it is much harder to get your
message across. This does not mean that you have to select a format
that has 100% acceptance, but you will need to assess how tech-savvy
your audience is and what format is going to be the most widespread
among your target audience. If you are targeting a tech-savvy
audience, they will be more likely to download the newest version of
the plug-in if they do not have it installed. Do not count on a less
technical audience to successfully download and install new
technologies.<a name="INDEX-608" />
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-3.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.3. Cost for streaming audio</h3>

<p>To add streaming to your web site, you may need to purchase one or
more of the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Encoding software to convert your raw media files into the
appropriate format for web delivery
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dedicated server software to stream your encoded media files</p>
</li><li>
<p>Hardware to install your server on (this may include several systems
for redundancy and scalability)
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Bandwidth to transmit data from your server over the Internet</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The cost of <a name="INDEX-609" />
<a name="INDEX-610" />streaming
can range from free to hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on
how many of the above items you will need to purchase. For example,
if you are already running an NT server and have a dedicated T1 line,
you can use Windows Media for no extra cost. Some vendors provide
free introductory-level streaming solutions such as Real Networks. If
you have administrative access privilege to your web server, you can
install the free Basic RealServer G2. Alternatively, if you are a
multimedia producer and own a copy of Macromedia Director or Flash,
you can export Shockwave files and stream them from your regular web
server for free.
</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, if you are a major Internet portal
running a hot Sun machine with thousands of simultaneous listeners,
you are going to need a healthy budget for equipment and bandwidth
and, if you are using RealMedia, the appropriate number of streaming
licenses. Keep in mind that you may not need to spend as much on
streaming licenses as you may have thought. A 60-stream license can
go a long way. If your average user listens to your audio for five
minutes or less, you can deliver 17,280 streams per day with a
60-stream license.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-3.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.4. Learning curve and documentation support</h3>

<p>As is the case with limited budgets, everyone has a tolerance level
for learning new technologies. Keep in mind that some formats provide
much more documentation and software tools for getting started.
RealMedia, for example, has outstanding documentation and software
support, including sophisticated tools for automatic server
configuration. In contrast, other formats such as MP3 and MIDI are
not all-in-one proprietary streaming solutions but are merely
standards for audio compression or musical notation and thus do not
offer a single source for <a name="INDEX-611" /> <a name="INDEX-612" />documentation and support.
</p>

<p>Besides documentation and support, the real hurdle depends on the
scale of your streaming needs. If you merely want to broadcast the
annual company report to a few hundred nationwide sales
representatives, streaming audio is a much simpler affair versus
competing with
<a name="INDEX-613" />Spinner.com to
become the king of Internet radio. The difference in the
infrastructure required for streaming to a few hundred listeners per
day versus tens of thousands is night and day. If you are
broadcasting to a huge audience with a scalable robust system, the
learning curve is going to be much steeper than setting up a free
Basic RealServer or throwing some audio files up on your HTTP web
server. Large-scale professional broadcasting requires advanced
configurations and logistics, such as multicasting with multiple
servers and backup systems in place for redundancy.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-3.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.5. Audio fidelity and compression</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-614" />Audio
fidelity for the end listener is determined by the quality and
specific setting of the codec used for audio compression and
decompression. Better compression algorithms, such as MP3, result in
higher fidelity audio playback over the same bandwidth connection.
A<a name="INDEX-615" /> <a name="INDEX-616" />udio fidelity is also determined by
the target file size and bandwidth settings you are using when
encoding the sound file. A larger target file size requires less
compression and audio degradation but more end-listener bandwidth
capacity.
</p>

<p>Server performance -- the ability of the server to detect and send
the appropriate stream to the end listener -- is often just as
important a factor in producing an overall quality listening
experience as the codec.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-3.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.6. Low bandwidth performance overall</h3>

<p>Nobody likes to scrimp on quality or excitement, but if you have to
tailor your media to fit the lowest common denominator of your
audience, you will have to make some tough choices. Some formats,
such as RealMedia, excel in bandwidth and browser compatibility.
Other formats, such as Shockwave or Flash, work better in
high-bandwidth 56 Kbps and DSL environments and provide little to no
support for server-side bandwidth negotiation.
</p>

<p>There are two factors to consider when selecting a format for
<a name="INDEX-617" /> <a name="INDEX-618" />low-bandwidth environments: the
inherent ability of the format to provide compelling media with small
file sizes, and the server-side technology to manage the delivery of
media when constrained by low or fluctuating bandwidths.
</p>

<p>Beatnik, for example, packs a huge punch of interactive excitement in
an extremely compact file size because it utilizes MIDI. The use of
bandwidth-friendly MIDI technology gives
<a name="INDEX-619" />Beatnik an inherent advantage over
Shockwave or RealMedia. On the other hand, RealMedia provides better
server-side support for ensuring that files get delivered and do not
drop out, regardless of the bandwidth of the end user.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-3.7" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.7. Server performance and software quality</h3>

<p>Thinking big? For those of you who need to stream audio and video
content to thousands of simultaneous listeners on the scale of a CNN,
NPR, or C|net, you will need a format that provides powerful
server-side features and tools. And if you plan on broadcasting live
events, you will need a real-time encoding and streaming system that
runs on a dedicated web server.
</p>

<p>RealMedia and Windows Media are the leading technologies for
large-scale
<a name="INDEX-620" />broadcasting,
with <a name="INDEX-621" />SHOUTcast
(MP3) and QuickTime close runners-up. The RealServer and Windows
Media Server provide bandwidth negotiation that ensures smooth audio
playback for the end listener and prevents annoying drop-outs when
bandwidth fluctuates.
</p>

<p>Beyond the actual server software you choose to install, whether
it's RealMedia, Windows Media, SHOUTcast (MP3), or QuickTime,
streaming to a large audience is just as much or more about the
hardware and bandwidth as the format you choose. Large-scale
broadcasting requires multiple systems, servers, and huge bandwidth
connections. That's why many companies outsource their media
broadcasting to companies like
<a name="INDEX-622" />Broadcast.com
or
<a name="INDEX-623" />Network24.com.

you select the appropriate format.
