<h2 class="sect1">11.4. Using the Beatnik Editor </h2>

<p>Now that you've worked with some premade content, let's
take a look at how to create your own <em class="filename">.rmf</em>
files. The <a name="INDEX-1479" />Beatnik Editor is the primary tool for
creating the <em class="filename">.rmf</em> files native to the Beatnik
Player. This tool imports standard MIDI files and facilitates access
and reassignment to the players built-in sound banks and patches. In
addition, digital audio samples can be imported and assigned to
various key ranges of a user-defined instrument patch within the
custom user bank. After the samples are mapped to MIDI note ranges,
they can be triggered by MIDI note commands just like the standard
samples within the Player.
</p>

<p>The Beatnik Editor is best used in conjunction with an OMS-compatible
sequencing program such as Opcode's Vision, or Emagic's
<a name="INDEX-1480" />Logic Audio.
<a name="INDEX-1481" />OMS
(Open Music System) acts as an intermediary translator between the
sequencing software and the Beatnik Editor, allowing a
"live" MIDI connection to the Beatnik instruments.
Unfortunately, there is a significant lag in the response time of the
Beatnik instruments, which makes it nearly impossible to compose
directly with the Beatnik sounds. Although this is something Beatnik
hopes to address, currently the best workaround requires the use of
another general MIDI instrument to perform the input tasks and then
audition the finished sequence with the various channels assigned to
the instruments of the Beatnik Editor.
</p>

<p>You can do this by choosing the File <img height="15" alt="Figure 11.4" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Link to Sequence command.
You must launch the Beatnik editor first and then your sequencer in
order for the interapplication communication to work properly. This
enables your sequencer to trigger the Beatnik player's
multi-instrument tone generator, and to hear the composition exactly
as the end user will hear it. The lag is actually still present, but
all tracks are delayed by the same amount in this case, so it
doesn't create any audible problem.
</p>

<p>You can create MIDI sequences in any MIDI-sequencing program capable
of exporting a standard type 1 MIDI file. You need to include the
bank and patch assignments for the various MIDI channels in your
exported file. This standard MIDI file is then imported into the
editor, as shown in <a href="ch11_04.htm">Figure 11-6</a>. Note that your MIDI
sequence will differ from what you heard when using the MIDI
instrument you composed with. The best way to minimize the difference
is to compose with a MIDI instrument that has banks and patch
assignments that conform to the General MIDI specification. Since
Beatnik instrument banks also map to this specification, your tracks
will play with similar instrument sounds.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-11-FIG-6" /><div class="figure"><img height="345" alt="Figure 11-6" src="figs/aud.1106.gif" width="400" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 11-6. The Beatnik Editor is useful for integrating different audio formats as well as editing custom samples.</h4>

<p>As of this writing, the Beatnik Editor was available only for the
Macintosh. For Windows users, Beatnik has introduced the Beatnik
Converter. The Converter does not allow the designer to create or
assign custom instruments for the third bank, nor does it allow a
live MIDI connection to the Beatnik instruments. It can import
standard MIDI files or audio sample data and convert them to an
<em class="filename">.rmf</em> file.
</p>

<p>In order to run
the<a name="INDEX-1482" /> Beatnik Editor, you will need a
PowerPC-based Mac running System 7.1 or higher and Sound Manager 3.1
or higher. You should also have a MIDI instrument with a built-in
General MIDI library. You will also want an OMS-compatible MIDI
sequencing application and the OMS system extension(s). OMS is a MIDI
utility that allows communication between an external MIDI
controller, the computer itself, and other MIDI applications such as
the Beatnik Editor or MIDI sequencer. If you want to create custom
samples and instruments for the Beatnik Editor, you will also need a
standard sound editing application such as Sound Designer II, Bias
Peak, SoundEdit 16, or Sound Forge.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-11-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.4.1. Getting started</h3>

<p>When you first open the
<a name="INDEX-1483" />Beatnik Editor, you will be prompted
to create a new session or open an existing session. You can think of
a session as the workspace in which you collect and manipulate the
various elements that will eventually be integrated and exported as
an <em class="filename">.rmf</em> file. When you save a session file, it
is important to understand that the elements remain in their native
format. For example, a <em class="filename">.wav</em> file is still a
<em class="filename">.wav</em> file, and a standard MIDI file is still a
standard MIDI file. It is not an <em class="filename">.rmf</em> file until
it is exported as such. This allows you to save your work in progress
and to re-open a session file at a later time and manipulate the
various files in their native format. Once the file is exported as an
<em class="filename">.rmf</em> file, you cannot edit the individual
elements.
</p>

<p>When you create a new session, you can name it, and the program
interface will display five windows: the Real Time window, the Songs
window, the Samples window, the Instruments window, and the Keyboard
window. Each appears with the session name at the top of its window.
The Instruments window is a list of the instruments you have
available to you. Likewise, the Songs and Samples windows show the
songs and the samples that are available to you. Notice that the
windows have pop-up menus that allow access to other banks. The
Keyboard window is a graphical representation of a MIDI keyboard on
which you can mouse-click to audition various instruments at
different pitches, and also view MIDI key ranges, which you can map
samples to. The Real Time window allows you to view important data
such as CPU load, time, global reverb settings, and other graphical
feedback in real time as you load and play with different elements.
</p>

<p>Those who have worked with a MIDI keyboard or sequencer software will
find the Beatnik Editor's interface familiar and intuitive. If
you haven't worked with MIDI or a keyboard sampler, don't
worry. The interface is still fairly easily understood and deals
mainly with MIDI channel assignments, General MIDI patch assignments,
and MIDI key note ranges. There is good documentation available for
the Beatnik Editor, and the software may be downloaded free of charge
at Beatnik's web site <a href="../../../../../../www.beatnik.com/">http://www.beatnik.com</a>. The Pro Version includes MP3
compression and is moderately priced.

<h3 class="sect2">11.4.2. Importing MIDI and audio files</h3>

<p>To import a <a name="INDEX-1484" />MIDI file into your session, select File
<img height="15" alt="Figure 11.4.2" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Import. From the dialog box, select the MIDI file and click
the Import button (the editor also supports dragging and dropping
your standard MIDI files on the Song window). Your MIDI file will now
appear in the Song window. Once it's displayed in the Song
window, you can highlight the name of the song and then manipulate
the MIDI file by opening the song item of the menu bar.
</p>

<p>To import an audio file or sample into your session, select File
<img height="15" alt="Figure 11.4.2" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Import as shown in <a href="ch11_04.htm">Figure 11-7</a>. From the
dialog box, select an AIFF, WAV, or a Sound Designer II file if (you
are a user of Digidesign's Pro Tools Software), and click the
Import button (you can also drag and drop these file types directly
into the Samples window). Your sample will now appear in the Samples
window. As with MIDI, once it's in the Samples window, you can
now manipulate the audio sample file.
</p>

<h3 class="sect2">11.4.3. Manipulating the files</h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1485" />Beatnik
Editor menu bar allows you to manipulate songs, instruments, and
samples. The appropriate menu will become activated or grayed out
depending on type of file you have highlighted (and in which window).
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-11-SECT-4.3.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.4.3.1. Working with songs</h3>

<p>Let's start with songs. Standard MIDI files can be imported
into the editor where they will appear in the Songs window, as shown
in <a href="ch11_04.htm">Figure 11-8</a>.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-11-FIG-8" /><div class="figure"><img height="367" alt="Figure 11-8" src="figs/aud.1108.gif" width="317" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 11-8. The Songs window displays the audio and MIDI files you have imported into the editor as well the Groovoids currently installed in the Editor.</h4>

<p>The pop-up menu at the top of the Songs window has four possible
choices: All, Groovoids, User Songs, or Imported
<em class="filename">.rmf</em> s. As explained earlier in this chapter,
<a name="INDEX-1486" />Groovoids
are small, premade MIDI compositions that are built into the Beatnik
Player, so you can experiment with these files immediately. Some are
stingers and cues, and some make great interface sounds. Groovoids
cannot be edited or changed in any way. However, any user-imported
file that appears in the User Songs view can be edited. You can
listen to any of the songs by double-clicking them, by using the
keyboard shortcut Command-T, or by highlighting the name of the song
and then clicking the Play button in the Real Time window.
</p>

<p>When you have highlighted a song in the Song window, you can change
the song's tempo, volume, and reverb settings by choosing Song
<img height="15" alt="Figure 11.4.3.1" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Song Settings from the menu bar. This displays the window
shown in <a href="ch11_04.htm">Figure 11-9</a>. The value in the Tempo field
represents a percentage of the tempo for the song, where 100% is
normal speed. Percentages over 100% will cause the song to play at
faster than normal speed; values of less than 100% play at slower
than normal speed. You can select one of several different reverb
types to be associated with the song. You can also set a
"Volume gain" setting for each song. Note that these
settings will be saved with the song and will be reflected on the web
page when the song is played back using the Beatnik plug-in.

<h4 class="objtitle">Digital watermarking and copyright protection</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>The copyright and media information are watermarked and encrypted
within the
<a name="INDEX-1487" />Beatnik
file so no matter where the file goes, the appropriate information
and credits follow. As with Liquid Audio, digital watermarking is an
essential feature for professional musicians, producers, and music
industry professionals, as it guarantees proper copyright information
and necessary security features to protect the rights of songwriters
and publishers.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Most artists make a living from royalties paid by people who use and
enjoy their music. Artists are accustomed to being paid royalties by
certain agencies such as ASCAP or BMI, which collect the money and
distribute it to the artists. However, one of the fundamental flaws
or assets of the Web, depending on which side of the fence you sit,
is that media on the Net is easy to download without proper
permission. With the 40-bit digital encryption and watermarking
included with Beatnik, artists, publishers, and sound designers can
be secure that their music is protected from piracy.
</p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>You can also edit the copyright information for a song by selecting
the song and then choosing Song <img height="15" alt="Figure 11.4.3.1" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Copyright. The information
that you enter in the copyright window can be accessed by the user
via the Beatnik plug-in. As copyright protection with electronic
music becomes increasingly important, this is a welcome feature for
those of us who wish to protect our hard work from being copied and
pasted into a web site that didn't bother to pay for it. It
also lets you reassure your clients that the sound design you create
for them won't be available to everyone else free of charge.
The copyright information in a Beatnik <em class="filename">.rmf</em>
cannot be edited by the user. Tampering with it will cause the file
to be unplayable. In addition to this watermarking,
<em class="filename">.rmf</em> files are also scrambled with 40-bit
digital encryption, which affords further protection to the creative
community.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1488" />copyright window contains the following
fields:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Title</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The title of your piece of music</p>
</dd><dt><b>Composer(s)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The composer of your piece of music</p>
</dd><dt><b>Copyright</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The music's copyright line, e.g., &copy; 2000 CS Audio Visual,

</dd><dt><b>Composer Notes</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Any notes about the music, such as special commentary, thanks, etc.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Once the copyright information and song settings have been adjusted
to your needs, you can export your song as a Beatnik
<em class="filename">.rmf</em> file, which maybe embedded in a web page
for playback with the Beatnik Player plug-in.
</p>

</div>

<a name="sound-CHP-11-SECT-4.3.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">11.4.3.2. Working with instruments</h3>

<p>There are three banks of sounds to compose with. As previously
discussed, two of the banks are contained in the Beatnik Player; the
third must be created in the
<a name="INDEX-1489" />Beatnik Editor and attached to the
<em class="filename">.rmf</em> file. You do not have to create any
original instruments to compose high-quality original music.
Furthermore, if your final <em class="filename">.rmf</em> file uses only
the standard instruments of the Beatnik Player's first two
banks, you gain the advantage of extremely low data rates and quick
download times for the end user. However, the option of custom
instruments and samples affords the sound designer/composer powerful
and unique creative possibilities (with the consequence of larger
file sizes and longer load times).
</p>

<p>Lets take a look at the three banks:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Bank One (the General MIDI bank)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>A complete set of 128 General MIDI instruments and a full GM
percussion set
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Bank Two (the special bank)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>128 <a name="INDEX-1490" />special instruments and a special
percussion set
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Bank Three <a name="INDEX-1491" />(the user bank)</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Room for 128 user instruments and a user percussion set</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The General MIDI bank, shown in <a href="ch11_04.htm">Figure 11-10</a>, ensures
almost universal compatibility with all standard MIDI files. The
special bank provides an extended set of instruments created
specially for the Beatnik System by Beatnik composers and sound
designers, including numerous sound effects customized for the Web.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-11-FIG-10" /><div class="figure"><img height="192" alt="Figure 11-10" src="figs/aud.1110.gif" width="400" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 11-10. The Instruments window displays the available instruments in Beatnik's Audio Engine, including a General MIDI bank, a special instrument and percussion bank, and a user bank that can be filled with customized instruments, samples, and percussion instruments.</h4>

<p>In addition to importing your own samples, you may also use the user
bank to create custom-edited versions of the pre-existing Beatnik
instruments by making a copy and altering the instrument settings to
your specific needs. These options are described later.
</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">What is that song called?</h4>
<p>You don't have to remember its name. The song title, composer, copyright, and composer fields associated with each song in the copyright settings are displayed as the music is played. </p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>You can view all of these instruments by opening the Instrument
window from the Windows menu. The pop-up list in the top of the
window allows you to select the different banks for viewing and
editing. The instruments in the GM and special banks cannot be
edited, deleted, or changed; you can, however, copy and paste them
into user bank slots if you would like to modify them or create new
instruments using them as a starting point.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1492" />Instrument menu includes the following
options:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Keymap</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Allows you to define the MIDI note range for individual samples of a
multisample instrument.
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Modulation</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Uses LFOs (Low Frequency Oscillators) to effect various parameters of
the sound.
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Volume</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates and changes the instrument's envelope (attack, sustain,
decay, and release).
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Filters</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Uses dynamic low-pass filters to change the instrument's sound.</p>
</dd><dt><b>Instrument Settings</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Tweaks an instrument's reverb, looping, pitch, and pan settings.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Experiment with these different options and various settings.
Altering pan settings and LFO modulation can have a striking effect
on your music. In fact, a relatively simple sound, such as a bell
chime or a spoken word, can be altered to sound very complex using
combinations of these choices, and entirely new instruments can be
created.
</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Including web links</h4>
<p>You can enter URLs in the composer notes field. This allows listeners on the Web to link directly to a web page of your choosing from the copyright display window of the Beatnik plug-in. To enter a URL, type it in simple text form and the Beatnik plug-in will resolve it automatically. Do not enter complete HTML. For example, type in <em class="emphasis">www.raspberrymedia.com</em>, not <em class="emphasis">http://www.raspberrymedia.com</em>.

<h3 class="sect3">11.4.3.3. Working with samples</h3>

<p>The Samples window shows an alphabetical list of all the samples
associated with the current
<a name="INDEX-1493" />Beatnik
session. The samples used by the built-in General MIDI bank and the
special bank are displayed in italics while user-imported samples are
displayed in plain text. Again, the built-in samples cannot be edited

slot. They are automatically duplicated if you make a copy of a
General MIDI or a special bank instrument in the Instrument window.
If you want to view only the custom samples you have imported, select
User Samples from the Sample window's pop-up menu.

<a name="sound-CHP-11-SECT-4.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">11.4.4. Making a custom instrument from your imported samples</h3>

<p>After you have the samples imported and compressed, they are eligible
to become part of a
<a name="INDEX-1494" />custom instrument. To do this, move
the mouse into the Instrument window, and select the user bank from
the pop-up menu. In a newly created session, you will see that the
bank is empty. Double-click on the first empty instrument. This
brings up a keymapping tool (shown in <a href="ch11_04.htm">Figure 11-11</a>)
that allows you to create zones (or keymap ranges) and assign
individual samples to the various zones. If you have worked with a
MIDI keyboard sampler, you will be familiar with this tool. This is
the standard method in which instrument designers create a full range
of chromatic notes with as few samples as possible. A sample usually
sounds its best at the pitch it was sampled at (this is called
the<a name="INDEX-1495" />
<em class="emphasis">root pitch</em>), but it is possible to
"stretch" the sample across a limited note range before
it starts to lose its quality. You can easily verify this by
assigning one sample to the entire 88-key range of a piano and
auditioning the sample at various places on the keyboard. The trick
is to determine the exact range of notes where an individual sample
sounds reasonably good, and to record new root samples for the note
ranges where the sound quality falls apart. If you use at least one
or two root samples for every octave, that is sufficient. For
example, you may use root samples at C and F in every octave you
intend to use. This is a common practice of sound designers who
routinely create their own customized mappings of samples on an
88-key keyboard controller.

then link the samples to the various zones, and define the keymap
ranges by highlighting the notes of the keyboard graphic in the top
of the window. By moving the three small arrows, you can determine to
which notes the root pitches for the individual samples and the
overall instruments are mapped. When you have finished, you can name
the instrument in the Name field at the bottom of the window. You now
have a custom instrument containing multiple samples that can be
triggered by MIDI note on commands -- just like the standard
