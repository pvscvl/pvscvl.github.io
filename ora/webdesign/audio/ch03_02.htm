<h2 class="sect1">3.2. Recording techniques</h2>

<p>Capturing<a name="INDEX-308" /> a signal to tape or disk clean of
excessive reverberation or noise is critical. You can always add
effects later to enhance or alter a sound, but it is difficult to
remove distortion and noise from the original source. Compression in
the encoding process also degrades your sound slightly. The higher
the quality of the original source material, the higher the quality
of the final output to the Web. In addition to selecting the right
equipment, properly setting up your studio and reducing noise on
location also results in a cleaner signal.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-3-SIDEBAR-5" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Watch the levels: analog versus digital distortion</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>In analog recording it was often advantageous to apply
<a name="INDEX-309" />distortion -- that is, push beyond
the maximum recording level "into the red" by about 9dB.
Such analog distortion enriches the sound by first raising, and then
compressing the level of quieter sounds. Furthermore, analog
"tube" distortion often produces the pleasing effect of
adding harmonics or tones to a voice or an instrument track.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Digital encoding, on the other hand, cannot quantify signals above
0dB. Thus, digital distortion produces unpleasant noise and unwanted
clicks and pops, known as
<a name="INDEX-310" />artifacts.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>If your digital audio signal is in the red, turn down the input gain
levels until the green LED lights are bouncing up and down below the
0dB point. Set your reference levels by having the voice-over artist
or musician briefly play the loudest passage of the piece and turn
your input levels down accordingly. Better yet, insert a compressor
in the signal chain between the mic pre-amp and the sound card to
reduce volume peaks and keep the signal below 0dB at all times.

<p>A studio environment is optimized for the best possible acoustics in
music and voice recording. In a typical studio situation, you also
work with well-rehearsed, professional voice or music talent and have
access to a wide selection of high-quality microphones and effects
processors.
</p>

<p>In contrast, field recording requires capturing sounds in less than
optimal conditions. Because most field recordings take place
outdoors, it is difficult to prevent poor acoustics and the intrusion
of extraneous noise. Furthermore, in a field-recording situation,
your equipment is limited to a set of microphones and a small
portable DAT machine, making it likely you will capture spontaneous,
unrehearsed dialogue and sounds.
</p>

<p>For both environments, there are recommended ways of dealing with
unwanted sounds.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-3-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">3.2.1. Studio recording</h3>

<p>If <a name="INDEX-311" />you are
recording voice or music talent on a regular basis, you will want to
reconfigure an existing room to optimize the acoustics, or better
yet, build a new room specifically designed for audio recording. A
good sound studio should have optimal acoustics for music or voice
(as described later in this section) and isolation from extraneous
noises.
</p>

<p>Ideally, your studio should is<a name="INDEX-312" />olate
recording and engineering activities in separate rooms. This
completely removes equipment noise from your recording environment.
If you have only one room for recording, mixing, and monitoring your
sound, implement some or all of these suggestions:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Isolate and place noisy, fan-cooled hard drives or power amps into a
padded box or a closet with enough air circulation around the
components.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Place the microphone as far away from the equipment as possible, and
point it away from any noise sources.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cover the wall behind the voice talent with four-inch acoustical
foam.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Record at night, after office hours if your recording studio is in a
busy office environment.
</p>
</li></ul>
<a name="sound-CHP-3-SECT-2.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.2.1.1. Proper room acoustics: capturing a "dry" signal</h3>

<p>We <a name="INDEX-313" />perceive
spatial distance audibly by the direction or angle of strong sound
reflections. Minimizing reflections in your studio prevents these
unwanted "directional" clues from being permanently
imbued on your source recording. If you record a direct signal with
as little reflection as possible, you can add artificial
reverberation to recreate any acoustic environment. For voice-over
work, recording a "<a name="INDEX-314" /> <a name="INDEX-315" />dry" signal without reverberation
provides the maximum flexibility to "sweeten" the sound
with digital effects in the post-production process. If your source
recording has highly distinctive characteristics, it is nearly
impossible to remove those reflections in post-production.
</p>

<p>To determine the characteristics of your <a name="INDEX-316" />room,
try this simple test. Wait for a quiet moment and clap your hands
loudly or yell. Listen to the amount of reverberation and reflections
produced. If you hear an echo or large amounts of
<a name="INDEX-317" />reverberation, consider using a
different room entirely. If you hear a pitch or a ringing sound, a
fair amount of acoustical treatment will be needed. An example of the
use of acoustic foam is shown in <a href="ch03_02.htm">Figure 3-6</a>. If you
hear only a slight echo or reverberation, which will be the case in
most small, carpeted rooms in an office or home, you will need to
make only a few minor adjustments to achieve good acoustics.

<h4 class="objtitle">Saving high-quality masters</h4>
<p>Always record your source audio with the highest sample rate and bit-depth possible. 16-bit, 44,100 Hz audio is the standard for high-quality source files. 24-bit masters are even better, but probably are not necessary for most web audio applications. For recording web audio, keep in mind that increased bandwidth in the future will allow for higher quality streaming audio. Always save your original high-quality source file in the event you want to convert it into a higher-quality format at a later time, or to incorporate it into other media such as television or film. </p>

<h3 class="sect3">3.2.1.2. Optimizing your recording environment</h3>

<p>Isolating your studio from outside street noise is difficult.
Anywhere air can pass into your studio -- under doors, through
cracks in window panes -- noise will follow. You can reduce the
intrusion of most high-pitched frequencies by placing rubber sealing
strips along the sides of doors and windows and patching any other
spots in your studio where air can pass through. Isolating your
studio from bass frequencies is far more difficult. Unlike most
high-frequency sounds, bass frequencies travel easily through walls.
</p>

<p>True <a name="INDEX-318" />isolation
from the sounds of passing cars or airplanes is achieved by
constructing a room within a room where the walls of the outer room
contain substantial mass, and the inside room is carefully isolated
or physically disconnected from the walls of the outer room. In most
cases, this process is far too expensive and laborious for
small-scale audio production. If you are recording in an urban
environment, select a room in the middle of a building or one with
extra-thick walls.
</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Music recording</h4>
<p>For recording music, you will want a "livelier" room with more reverb. A room with hardwood floors generally produces more pleasing acoustics than will a sound-deadening room with wall-to-wall carpet.</p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>The problems that arise from recording in small rooms are associated
with unwanted reflections and echoes. Hard, flat surfaces, such as
hardwood or tile flooring, bare sheetrock or cement walls, and glass
windows are problematic because they reflect a slightly delayed copy
of the original sound back to the microphone (in the form of an
echo). This echo effect can be exacerbated if the sound is further
reflected between parallel walls.
</p>

<p>Placing thick <a name="INDEX-319" />acoustic foam on strategic spots on walls
and ceilings is the easiest solution to reduce reflections. The usual
strategy is to place foam opposite bare spots in a checkerboard
pattern. The most common mistake is to use too much foam, which leads
to unwanted bass build-up, since foam has little effect on low
frequencies. If you cannot afford acoustic foam, you can improvise
with additional wall hangings, rugs, bookshelves, and other
furniture, as well as with pillows, blankets, or mattresses. These
accessories help absorb the sound waves and create diffuse surfaces
to reflect the audio away from the microphone.

<h4 class="objtitle">Recording voice-overs: tips from an expert</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>Reid Ridgway has been working with digital audio for 15 years. He is
the owner and chief recording engineer for C.S. Audio Visual, a
multimedia and recording studio in Santa Cruz, California.
Ridgway's interactive sound design credits include MCA
Records' <em class="emphasis">On the Road with B. B. King</em>
CD-ROM for Mindscape, and Apple Computer's Twentieth
Anniversary Mac welcome presentation. Reid also produces sound for
television and film. See <a href="ch03_02.htm">Figure 3-7</a>.
</p>
<a name="sound-CHP-3-FIG-7" /><div class="figure"><img height="257" alt="Figure 3-7" src="figs/aud.0307.gif" width="400" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 3-7. Reid Ridgway at the mixing controls of his Santa Cruz sound studio where the production of MCA Record's On the Road with B. B. King took place</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>In addition to proper room acoustics and microphone selection,
Ridgway says the key steps to capturing a good voice-over are
microphone placement, talent selection, and coaching.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p><em class="emphasis">Microphone placement.</em> Place the
<a name="INDEX-320" />microphone
approximately six to eight inches from the speaker's mouth. For
a richer, deeper bass tone, place it a bit closer. Point the
microphone slightly off-axis to the speaker's mouth to prevent
air from blowing directly into the microphone's capsule. Place
a pop screen between the speaker's mouth and the microphone to
further reduce wind noises and unwanted P's and S's.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>To determine optimal mic placement, ask the voice-over artist to
speak at different distances and angles from the microphone. Listen
to the sound change as the voice-over artist moves about and take
note of the best distance or angle.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>If you are using an inexpensive microphone, pay close attention to
its placement. The pick-up characteristics of cheaper microphones
vary widely. It is generally best to place a less-sensitive
microphone as close as possible to a person's mouth to get a
louder direct signal with less room noise.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p><em class="emphasis">Selecting a voice-over artist</em>. Have three to
four <a name="INDEX-321" />artists audition with a sample script
in front of your client. Ideally, use a voice-over artist with
theatrical experience and an even quality of voice who has some
familiarity with microphone technique. If you can, hire the
professional yourself instead of letting the client do it. Avoid
getting stuck with a dry-sounding employee with little or no
voice-over experience. A company representative may be handy at
pointing out terms and jargon, but don't let them explore a new
career in front of the microphone.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p><em class="emphasis">Coaching.</em> Voice artists are essentially actors
reading from scripts in a studio environment without an audience or
the context of human interaction. You have to provide the context for
the artist. If you allow them simply to read a script without feeling
or inspiration, the results will be disappointing. Coaching is
especially important if you are unable to get a professional
voice-over artist.

<p>Managing your studio's acoustics, microphone placement, and
recording talent are the more difficult aspects of studio recording.
Actually getting the sound onto your desktop is easy. Most sound
recording and editing applications use familiar tape deck controls,
such as play, record, pause, and stop. <a name="INDEX-322" />Macromedia SoundEdit 16's controls are

<p>Of course, <a name="INDEX-326" />not all
the audio on <a name="INDEX-327" />your web site will be recorded in a
studio environment. Capturing audio on location complicates matters
considerably. Field recording requires the use of a lightweight,
portable <a name="INDEX-328" />DAT machine with phantom power and
high-quality built-in mic pre-amps. Microphone selection and
placement are especially crucial to capturing good sound on location.
A few steps that also make for a positive experience include packing
a foam microphone covering or windsock to protect against wind,
carrying a backup microphone with an alternate pick-up pattern, or
simply moving the microphone closer to the sound source. The
following sections include some recommended methods for capturing
sound in different scenarios.<a name="INDEX-329" /> <a name="INDEX-330" />
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-3-SECT-2.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">3.2.2.1. Live concerts and events</h3>

<p>There are two primary methods for recording the sound of live events
and concerts: capturing the live stereo output of the
<a name="INDEX-331" />public address mixing console or
placing two condenser microphones in front of the stage or PA
speakers. Capturing the mix from the PA console is more convenient,
but using your own microphones generally results in a higher-quality
recording.
</p>

<p>All amplified events have some type of mixing console to blend the
various microphones onstage into two left and right channels for
output to the main speakers. A direct signal from the stage or main
concert mixing board produces the cleanest recording without crowd
noises and unwanted room reflections.
</p>

<p>Connect one of the extra left and right output channels directly into
your portable DAT machine. Check ahead of time that you have the
proper adapter cables to connect your DAT to the mixing board
outputs. Whenever possible, you should use <a name="INDEX-332" />XLR three-prong cables to connect to
the back of the mixing board. If your portable
<a name="INDEX-333" />DAT
machine does not have XLR inputs, you will need an
XLR-to-quarter-inch or stereo mini-cable adapter. (See <a href="appa_01.htm">Appendix A, "Creating the Ultimate Web Sound Studio: Buyers Guide and Web Resources"</a> for more on XLR and adapters.)
</p>

<p>If you are at an event or concert without a PA system or you do not
have access to the main mixing console, use a microphone plugged into
a portable DAT to capture the sound source. Set up a six- to
eight-foot tall microphone stand toward the middle or back of the
concert hall at the center stage position. Attach two small diaphragm
condenser microphones to the top of the stand and point them toward
the stage. You can place the microphones in an "x"
position, as shown in <a href="ch03_02.htm">Figure 3-10</a>, or parallel to
each other and six feet apart, pointed slightly outward to the left
and right sides of the stage, as shown in <a href="ch03_02.htm">Figure 3-11</a>.

<p>In-studio interviews are not always possible and, in some cases, not
even preferred. Even if the <a name="INDEX-334" />acoustics and equipment selection
are less than optimal, it is best to interview people in an
environment in which they're comfortable. An on-location
interview can be captured easily with a small portable DAT machine
and a microphone. Set up your equipment efficiently and try to make
the recording experience as transparent as possible. Often people are
intimidated by speaking into a microphone or are uncomfortable just
knowing every word is being captured on tape.

<p>The easiest way to capture a telephone interview is to use an inexpensive telephone recording box that sits between the wall outlet and your phone.

<p>Depending on the level of extraneous noise in your immediate

<p>A small lavaliere clip-on microphone attached to the

</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use a single omnidirectional microphone to record multiperson

<h3 class="sect3">3.2.2.3. Capturing ambient sounds</h3>

<p>To record <a name="INDEX-335" />ambient environmental sounds such as a
city street with cars passing or a distant bird call in a forest, use
an omnidirectional microphone with a wind protective foam covering
(known as a windsock). A shotgun microphone works best for capturing
the direct signal of a distant sound source.
</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Panel particulars</h4>
<p>A single microphone will not work if your recording environment is too noisy or people are sitting side by side in a long row. For panel discussions, use a separate lavaliere or cardioid microphone for each person's voice. Run the microphones through a small eight- or twelve-channel mixer with built-in pre-amps. Mix the signals down to a stereo signal and run the output to a portable DAT machine. </p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>The greatest challenge to <a name="INDEX-336" />ambient recording is capturing soft or
distant sounds without increasing the level of system noise. Using
high-quality, professional gear is the best way to ensure good
ambient recording. If you are capturing the soft sounds of a distant
<a name="INDEX-337" />bird
call, for example, and use a consumer-grade portable DAT machine, you
will instantly notice the presence of system noise in the form of a
continuous "shhh." This is because boosting the input
levels increases the system noise. Professional-grade DAT machines
have higher quality mic pre-amps and do a better job of boosting the
signal without introducing noise.
</p>

<p>If you are using a consumer-grade DAT machine, avoid turning the
input levels up too high. To capture a louder signal, position your
microphone closer to the sound source<a name="INDEX-338" /> instead.

<a name="sound-CHP-3-SIDEBAR-11" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Outdoor concert recording</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>One of the greatest technical challenges in field recording is
avoiding<a name="INDEX-339" /> wind noise, especially with extremely
sensitive condenser microphones. John Neilson, live sound engineer
and mixer for touring music acts such as Kenny Loggins and Peter,
Paul, and Mary, offers several tips on the most effective techniques
for reducing wind noise.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Placing a windsock over the microphone and making alterations to
equalization settings are two effective steps to avoid wind. A
windsock or foam covering diffuses the energy of incoming wind or
bursts of air from certain vocal sounds (such as B's and
P's) before they blow across and vibrate the microphone
diaphragm. The downside is that windsocks reduce the energy of
incoming high frequencies, requiring equalization adjustments to
boost the 1,000 Hz-and-up treble range. Removing or "rolling
off" the EQ below the 60 Hz to 80 Hz range will reduce most
wind vibrations.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>At an outdoor Kenny Loggins concert in Reno, Nevada, a windstorm
unexpectedly blew in midway through the show. The stage crew had to
quickly place windsocks over all the microphones and make EQ
adjustments in the middle of a song to prevent wind sounds from
drowning out the entire mix. Fortunately, Loggins prefers to use a
less-sensitive dynamic cardioid microphone that does not pick up as
much wind as a condenser microphone.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>After placing a windsock over the mic, Neilson had Loggins sing
closer to it so more of the direct signal would be captured through
the foam material. Because the singer was closer to the microphone,
Neilson turned down the bass to compensate for the proximity effect.
To balance Loggins' vocals, Neilson made adjustments by ear,
reducing the bass in the 120 Hz-and-under range, and boosting the
overall higher frequencies above 1,000 Hz.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The sensitive small diaphragm condenser microphones used for the
percussion instruments were more difficult to protect against the
wind than the dynamic vocal microphones. The condenser mics were
placed overhead several feet above the sound source, with the mixing
board microphone pre-amps turned way up to capture the quiet sounds
of the chimes and rattles on the percussion tree. This combination
made the recording vulnerable to extraneous wind noise. After placing
windsocks on the mics, Neilson had to make further equalization
adjustments to avoid the wind noise. Starting in the 300 Hz-and-under
range, the low-end frequencies were rolled off. The frequencies below
60 Hz and 80 Hz were cut out completely. But after rolling off the
bass, the sound became thin. To compensate, Neilson was careful not
to turn down too much bass and to boost the high-end frequencies
above 1,000 Hz again.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>At a Peter, Paul, and Mary concert inside the Santa Cruz Civic
Auditorium, Neilson was faced with a different kind of
"wind" problem. In this case, the singers preferred the
sound of a more sensitive small diaphragm condenser microphone for
their acoustic music. Despite being indoors, these sensitive mics
needed windsocks to protect against the small amount of wind
generated from singing B's and P's.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>In this situation, the most effective method for avoiding air blowing
against the sensitive condenser microphone diaphragms again was to
use a windsock and roll off or remove all the frequencies below 60 Hz
or 80 Hz. Rolling off the lows does not generally affect the vocal
tone, since a human voice usually cannot drop below 60 Hz.
