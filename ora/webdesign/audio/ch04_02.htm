<h2 class="sect1">4.2. Digital effects</h2>

<p>Digital effects have evolved into highly sophisticated tools. Digital
effects editing allows you to easily attach or apply many effects to
an audio track, including reverberation or delay, preview it in
real-time, make subtle adjustments to the effect, and then output or
mix-down the track without permanently altering or changing the
original sound file. <a name="INDEX-378" />Digital effects give sound designers
more control and power to shape and craft sounds.
</p>

<p>Before the advent of digital-editing applications and modern-day
effects plug-ins, adding special effects to sound was cumbersome and
time-consuming; effects were added by running the original
"dry" audio signal through standalone effects boxes and
then routing the processed or "wet" sound back to the
tape recording device. The other alternative was to first record the
original sound to a multitrack recording device and run it through an
effects box during the mix-down (the process whereby all the tracks
are blended to a stereo master tape). While this method preserved the
original sound file, the creative constraints, real-time limitations
of adjusting multiple effects devices, and time requirements involved
in resetting and configuring the equipment were enormous. Now,
however, experimenting with a whole range of digital effects is just
a mouseclick away.
</p>

<p>Professionals often refer to the process of adding effects to sound
as "sweetening" the
<a name="INDEX-379" />sound.
When applying digital effects, use them sparingly and appropriately.
You want to enhance your sound, not overwhelm it. A little bit of
reverb or delay added to a sound file creates a nice sense of space
and enhances the sound considerably. Too much reverb, on the other
hand, can make the passage sound distant and unintelligible.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-SIDEBAR-3" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Destructive versus nondestructive editing</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>Destructive editing is the process of changing or altering an
original master file. When a <a name="INDEX-380" /> <a name="INDEX-381" />destructive edit is performed, the
altered sound file is permanently rewritten to disk. In contrast,
nondestructive editing never changes the original master file; it
merely alters its playback. Nondestructive edits become permanent
once the final mix is recorded to disk or if you save an alternative
version of the sound file. But the original source files are always
preserved as separate sound files. The only drawback is that you fill
up more disk space since you are saving multiple, separate sound
files. Of course, if you ever need to go back to the original and
make different edits, you'll be glad you gave up the disk
space.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Most multitrack recording and editing software includes both
destructive and nondestructive editing capabilities. Many
professional sound editors feature effects plug-ins that can be
applied to a soundtrack for previewing and are written to disk only
after you mix-down the multitrack session. Use nondestructive editing
when you are deleting regions of a sound file you may want to save or
when you are experimenting with different effects. Again, with
nondestructive editing you can always go back to the original sound
file and try a new edit or effect.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>If you are in the final mastering stages of preparing your mono or
stereo audio files for the Web or for CD reproduction, you may want
to use destructive editing. Destructive editing is also an effective
means of preserving disk space because you can delete large unwanted
regions of an audio file. Destructive editing can also be used for
rudimentary enhancements such as normalization and gain change or for
permanently writing effects to disk when your software plug-in
capabilities are limited (real-time effects previewing is
RAM-intensive and requires lots of system resources).
</p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>This caveat applies to all digital effects. A good rule is to always
use a little less effect than you think is necessary. In fact, when
the effect starts to sound just about right, try reducing it by 50%.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.1. Reverb</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-382" />
<a name="INDEX-383" />Reverberation
is the natural return of sound reflecting off the surrounding
environment, such as a wall or a hard reflective surface. The
returned sound enters the ear just a fraction of a second after the
initial sound. Reverb, in the form of hundreds and thousands of small
reflections, adds a pleasant warmth and richness to a sound.
</p>

<p>Reverberation is analogous to shading in graphic imaging and
photography. Adding a drop shadow behind an object gives an image
three-dimensional depth and richness. Similarly, adding reverb and
delay effects to an audio file give it three-dimensional richness.
Reverb and delay create a sense of physical space and simulate the
direction and distance for a particular sound source.
</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Keep the reverb consistent</h4>
<p>If you use reverb to simulate the richness of a sound produced in a stairwell or an echo chamber, remember to apply the same type of reverb to all the sounds in your web soundtrack mix. This maintains consistency and realism in the soundtrack. Just as a skilled artist paints shadows that are consistent with the light source's angle, color, and intensity, the web sound designer should apply the same type of reverb to all the sounds in a particular web site environment.</p></td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>Modern music, as well as film and television audio production, rely
heavily on the use of artificial or synthesized
<a name="INDEX-384" />reverb
to simulate the effect of recording on an old-time sound stage with
cathedral-like echoes and reverberation. Besides its use as a
"sweetener," artificial reverb is used by sound designers
to simulate the natural reverberation of different environments such
as a hallway or an underground parking lot.
</p>

<p>Generally, when you record a sound file, the recording is captured in
a studio environment or a room with little to no reverb of its own.
However, our ears are accustomed to hearing artificial reverb in film
and television sounds. In such mediums, the effects are colored or
enhanced to give the sound the appropriate ambience to match the
environment on the screen. For example, a recording engineer might
record an actor's voice-over in a studio for a scene filmed in
a large stairwell. The sound designer then adds reverberation to the
"dry" voice-over before the final soundtrack is mastered
to film. Similarly, with web audio, to match the characteristics of
real-world environments you may need to add reverb, echo, or other
effects to your sound files.
</p>

<p>Different software packages allow you to add effects in a variety of
ways. For example, <a name="INDEX-385" />SoundEdit
Pro has a preset list of effects, including reverb, delay, chorus,
and equalization. Professional editing applications allow you to
import third-party plug-ins and apply real-time nondestructive
effects, such as preview, apply, and mix-down, without permanently
altering the original sound file.
</p>

<p>To apply an effect using <a name="INDEX-386" />SoundEdit 16, import a sound file and
select the region to be edited. Then choose Effects <img height="15" alt="Figure 4.2.1" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Reverb.
What you see is a dialog window with a slider control that allows you
to choose the amount of reverb to add to the selection, as shown in
<a href="ch04_02.htm">Figure 4-5</a>. Use the descriptive values, which run
the spectrum from "Empty Room" to "Outer
Space," to get an idea of how much reverb to add.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-4-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.2.2. Delay</h3>

<p>Delay is a useful effect for imitating real-world echos created when
sound bounces off of a wall or a hard surface. Delay also is
effective in adding an interesting twist to an ordinary sound or
piece of music. In a music piece,
<a name="INDEX-387" />
<a name="INDEX-388" />delay
applied to an instrument or vocal track adds rhythmic richness and
depth. In fact, most <a name="INDEX-389" />pop tunes contain delay effects at some
point, especially on the lead vocal tracks.
</p>

<p>There are three parameters you need to adjust to apply delay: </p>

<ul><li>
<p>Volume of the delay over time</p>
</li><li>
<p>Number of times the delay repeats</p>
</li><li>
<p>Speed or tempo of the delay</p>
</li></ul>
<p>When adjusting the volume of the
<a name="INDEX-390" />delay, err on the subtle side by making the
echoes much lower in volume than the original sound. The exception to
this rule is when you're trying to simulate an echo-heavy
environment like a canyon or an alleyway.
</p>

<p>Adjusting the number of times an <a name="INDEX-391" />echo repeats is important for simulating
real-world sound effects or to prevent a music mix from becoming too
cluttered with repetitive delays. Generally, you want to set the
delay parameter to repeat between two and three times before it fades
to silence.
</p>

<p>When adding delay to an instrument track in a piece of music, it is
essential to calibrate or adjust the tempo of the
<a name="INDEX-392" />delay to match the tempo of the music or
beat.
</p>

<p>To add delay to your sound using SoundEdit 16, simply choose Effects
<img height="15" alt="Figure 4.2.2" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Delay. The Delay dialog, shown in <a href="ch04_02.htm">Figure 4-6</a>, gives you two options. Apply the option that
sounds best for your particular purpose. Click on the delay button to
process the file. When finished, audition the sound and listen to the
difference.
</p>

<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Audition first and often</h4>
<p>All digital processing lets you listen to a modified file and decide whether to keep the changes. It is a good idea to listen to each change before moving on. Audition an altered sound file right after it has been processed, and then choose undo and listen to the old version. Keep toggling between redo and undo to compare versions. If you have added too much reverb, or not enough, it is easy at this point to go back and reprocess the sound file. </p>
<p>Part of becoming a good sound "designer" is listening and learning which sounds are best in which applications. Practice often, until your ears are satisfied with the result. You cannot know which combinations will yield the sound you want until you try them out and listen to the differences firsthand. This is how the ear learns what sounds good and  how you learn to recreate the sound the next time.</p></td></tr></table></blockquote>

<h3 class="sect2">4.2.3. Pitch shift</h3>

<p>The Pitch shift <a name="INDEX-393" />
<a name="INDEX-394" />effect
alters both the pitch and duration of a sound file by recalculating
the length of the sound file, as shown in <a href="ch04_02.htm">Figure 4-7</a>. If you raise the pitch of a sound clip, it
recalculates the length of the sound file, making the duration and
disk size of the sound file smaller. To prevent a sound from changing
in duration -- such as when editing a sound clip for a music mix
or a film mix where a particular sound is tied to an event -- you
can check the "<a name="INDEX-395" />time correction" or
"<a name="INDEX-396" />preserve duration" button when
pitch-shifting. Most professional editors such as
<a name="INDEX-397" />Pro Tools and <a name="INDEX-398" />Sound
Forge feature time-corrected pitch shift;
<a name="INDEX-399" />SoundEdit 16 does not.
</p>

<p>Pitch shift is a creative tool for altering or transforming a sound
to create entirely new sounds; it is also a musical tool to lower or
raise a passage of music to another key. Many recording engineers use
pitch shift with precision to correct
<a name="INDEX-400" />musical passages and vocal or
instrument tracks that are slightly off pitch by a note or semi-tone.

<a name="sound-CHP-4-SIDEBAR-6" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Closeup: The B.B. King Sessions</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>The world of recording and editing presents many unique challenges to
sound designers. Many different techniques are used to produce some
of the sounds you hear. Consider this question: What do you do when a
client hands you a stack of audio tapes recorded over the past thirty
years in different studios and in live concert venues and asks you to
blend these various recordings to create a consistent feel as if they
were recorded at the same place and time? Reid Ridgway, chief sound
designer and recording engineer for C.S. Audio Visual (<a href="../../../../../../www.csaudio.com/">http://www.csaudio.com</a>), conquered this
challenge to produce a critically acclaimed soundtrack for MCA
Records: <em class="emphasis">On the Road With B.B. King: An Interactive Autobiography
with the King of the Blues</em>.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>First off, you should know that designing sound for the Web is a lot
like designing sound for CD-ROMs. In both mediums sound designers are
often faced with the task of integrating mixed quality audio source
material into a seamless, digital, highly compressed interactive
soundtrack.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>During the course of the B. B. <a name="INDEX-401" />King project, Reid was asked to blend a large
archive of taped interviews into a seamless interactive
<a name="INDEX-402" />audio
biography. The project was a great challenge because of the wide
range of recording quality between the different audio master tapes.
Moreover, the final output stage required a reduction to an 8-bit 22
kHz mono audio format. A few of the taped interviews were in pristine
condition but most were not. Most of the interviews were made in less
than optimal recording environments, such as impromptu situations.
Many were also recorded in an era when recording technology could not
match today's sound reproduction. Adding to the challenge, many
of the interviews were recorded outside with traffic noise and
different equalization and room tone from one recording to the next.
For example, Reid had to blend an outdoor interview of B.B. King with
traffic and barking noises in the background with an interview
recorded in a professional studio with high-quality microphones and
sound deadening acoustic foam. The objective was to play the two
interviews in consecutive order on the same screen of the CD-ROM and
have them sound as if they were recorded in the same environment.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>First, Reid tried to improve the quality of the outdoor recording by
removing the tape hiss and background noises. However, he quickly
realized he couldn't remove enough of the background noise.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>After experimenting with several solutions, Reid decided the best
option was to degrade the quality of the recording that was made in a
professional studio to match the poorer quality recording captured
outside. In this case, degrading the quality of one sound to match
the other sound produced the best result. You will find that
sometimes it's necessary to break the rules and use creative
solutions to produce a consistent soundtrack with a unified sound
from beginning to end.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Reid started degrading the studio recording by adding background
noises of traffic and barking dogs acquired from The Hollywood Edge
sound effects collection. Then he played the high-quality version
through a speaker placed outside and re-recorded it so the EQ, would
have the same characteristic as the outdoor interview. To further
match the EQ he placed the mic about the same distance away from the
loud speaker as the mic was from B.B. King during the outdoor
interview.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>After achieving a consistent EQ sound using the outdoor speaker
technique, Reid added some foley sound effects such as footsteps,
door sounds, and an old plumbing clank and leak for ambiance. Also
added were some of B.B. King's live recordings from the era.
These where all blended to create a uniform background music to the
final audio mix. In the particular scene Reid was working on, B.B.
was talking about his experience at the Fillmore concert hall in San
Francisco. Reid created a feel as if you were outside the concert
hall. Then eventually as the graphics showed B.B. King entering the
Fillmore, he switched over to the other recording to make any
lingering differences in their sound characteristics less perceptible
and the change more plausible.
</p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>By transforming a sound with pitch shift you can change the
personality of your sound, making it deeper and more ominous, or
higher, squeakier, and more comic. Brian Meyers, a former lead sound
designer at Living Books in San Francisco, used pitch-shifting to get
the professional sound he needed for a particular project. Meyers was
working on a multimedia version of the Berenstain Bears books and was
able to effectively use pitch shift to achieve authentic character
voices. Instead of having the voice-over artists read in childlike
voices, the producers recorded the actors' natural voices and
performed pitch shift on the recordings to create appropriate voices
for the baby bears. This case is a perfect example of using what is
necessary and nothing more. In a world of digital effects where
millions of possibilities exist, it is tempting to throw lots of
effects into a project. "Less is more" is usually a good
guideline.
</p>

<p>To change the pitch of a sound in SoundEdit 16, select the region of
the sound you want to alter, then select Effects <img height="15" alt="Figure 4.2.3" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Pitch Shift.
The Pitch Shift window displays a piano keyboard, the original time
duration of the sound file, versus the previewed length of the sound
file, and the multiple of the pitch shift. To preview and select the
pitch shift of the sound region, click on any key of the piano then
click the Shift button.

<h3 class="sect2">4.2.4. Bender</h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-403" />
<a name="INDEX-404" />bender effect
allows you to adjust the pitch of a sound by an amount that can vary
over the duration of the sound file. The result is a sound that seems
to gradually raise or lower in pitch. Applying this effect also
alters the length of the sound. If you want the entire sound file to
uniformly shift pitches, it is better to use the pitch-shift effect.
However, if you want the sound to alter pitch in a variety of ways
over time, experiment with the bender effect.
</p>

<p>With <a name="INDEX-405" />SoundEdit 16's bender effect, you
can use a pitch adjustment line to represent how the pitch will be
altered at each point in time along the waveform (as shown in <a href="ch04_02.htm">Figure 4-8</a>). The farther you move a handle away from the
zero point, the greater the pitch changes. The scale that lies on the
far left of the bender dialog box indicates the relative change in
pitch. If you drag the handle in the positive direction, the pitch of
the sound will be higher. Drag the handle in the negative direction,
and the pitch will be lower. The range selections determine the
amount of variation in the pitch shift. The options are 1 whole step,
1 octave, or 2 octaves.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-FIG-8" /><div class="figure"><img height="264" alt="Figure 4-8" src="figs/aud.0408.gif" width="400" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-8. The bender effect, often used for cartoon sounds, changes the pitch up  then down 1 octave across the selected region.</h4>

<p>Use the "1 whole step" option to create a vibrato effect,
where the sound alters up and down a small amount between the
original pitch. A <a name="INDEX-406" />step
is the distance in pitch between successive notes of the
<a name="INDEX-407" />diatonic
scale, such as the distance between C and D. A
<a name="INDEX-408" />half-step is the
distance between a note and its sharp, such as the interval from C to
C#. Generally, a half-step or whole step difference is a subtle shift
in pitch as opposed to a one-octave (12-step) shift.
</p>

<p>In <a href="ch04_02.htm">Figure 4-9</a>, the bender effect is used to alter
the sound between +1/2 step and -1/2 step and create what is referred
to as a "<a name="INDEX-409" />vibrato" effect. However, you could
use "1 octave" or "2 octaves" to produce a
more dynamic effect. Experiment with all three options as you search
for the sound you want to achieve.

<p>The <a name="INDEX-410" />
<a name="INDEX-411" />
<a name="INDEX-412" />backwards, or
"reverse," effect is self-explanatory. This effect simply
takes the selected waveform and flips it backwards so it plays in
reverse, as shown in <a href="ch04_02.htm">Figure 4-10</a>. This effect is
used by professional sound designers to add a special effect to a
soundtrack or to generate new source material from existing sound
files in their collection.
</p>

<p>Although used infrequently, the backwards effect can result in some
pretty wild and interesting sounds. You can use this effect to make
voices sound like they are caught in an alternate reality or are in a
dream state. You can also use short sound clips of speech or music
that are one or two seconds in length and apply the backwards effect
to create unusual, original sound <a name="INDEX-413" />effects.
