<p>This buyers <a name="INDEX-1503" />guide was developed as a result of the many interviews we conducted with web audio experts. The feedback was unanimous: with high-fidelity audio frequently compressed and degraded during conversion to web audio formats, the need to capture high-quality source material is essential. 
</p>
<p>Using the proper equipment and tools is one sure way to increase the
quality of your source material. If you are a web professional with
little audio engineering experience, the information in this appendix
will help you purchase and configure the best possible audio
production equipment and software suited to your needs.
</p>

<p>Not all audio equipment is created equal. There is a big difference
in quality between the inexpensive audio equipment found at your
neighborhood electronics shop versus the high-end professional audio
gear found at retailers catering exclusively to audio professionals.
It is no coincidence that audio professionals highly value their
tools. It takes good equipment in the right studio environment to
consistently capture a great musical performance or a voice-over
take. It is nearly impossible to take a bad recording with noise and
distortion and turn it into a pristine, professional-sounding
masterpiece, especially when faced with the compression formats used
for web delivery. The proper web sound studio will help you achieve
more professional results. For more tips on creating a suitable
studio, see <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Capturing Original Source Material"</a>.

<h2 class="sect1">A.1. Creating the ultimate web sound studio</h2>

<p>The key to building the ultimate <a name="INDEX-1504" />web sound studio is to select
professional-grade equipment that captures the highest fidelity audio
while avoiding equipment that adds noise and low-level distortion.
Professional gear should have balanced XLR inputs (large, three-pin
connectors) instead of 1/4-inch or RCA jacks, built-in power supplies
instead of external "wall warts," and high-grade, sturdy
electrical components that resist age and rust.
</p>

<p>This appendix outlines the standard equipment, software, and
accessories used for professional web audio production and sound
design. Where appropriate, each featured professional grade studio
component is listed with a "pro option," along with its
manufacturer's "list" price versus its
"street" price. Keep in mind that these prices are as of
June 2000. The professional grade equipment listed in this appendix
is targeted at a reasonable, small-scale audio production studio
budget of $25,000. Many professional studios used for film scoring
and music recording spend hundreds of thousands or millions of
dollars on equipment. If you just want to add some audio to your
site, the budget option targets the home studio builder with a budget
of a few thousand dollars.
</p>

<p>Street value prices are constantly fluctuating and may vary from
store to store depending on the retailer's wholesale purchase
price. Many retail chains offer "loss-leader" discount
prices on certain items to get you into the store so they can sell
you other, more expensive items. The street value prices in this
appendix do not reflect this pricing.

<h4 class="objtitle">It's the technique, not the tools</h4>
<p>Although this buyers guide emphasizes the importance of having great equipment, you do not always need the most expensive gear to get the results you want. Good recording and editing techniques are often far more important than expensive equipment. Some of the best web audio was produced on inexpensive "prosumer" gear. So if you have a limited budget, you can still get high-quality results with a little ingenuity and skill.</p> 
<p>However, if you are not sure you can pull recording miracles out of a custom, re-engineered $30 Radio Shack microphone, then spend the money and use professional grade equipment. </p>
