<h2 class="sect1">8.4. Making MP3 files</h2>

<p>There are three steps to creating <a name="INDEX-1109" />MP3 files for Internet distribution:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Your first step will often be to save your audio stream into AIFF or
WAV format. This typically starts with a compact disc, in which case
the raw bits on the CD need to be turned into a computer-recognizable
audio format. The process of extracting audio CD data is called
<em class="emphasis">ripping</em>. However, you can also encode live audio
streams to a raw format, which is typically not ripping but rather
recording.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The next step is to encode your raw audio stream into the MP3 format.
Fortunately, most modern encoding tools handle ripping and encoding
all in one step, even if they work in two steps behind the scenes.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Optionally, and assuming the user holds the legal copyright to the
music in question, you may want to upload your MP3 files to the
Internet.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>To work with and create MP3 audio, you need:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>	An MP3 ripping/encoding tool</p>
</li><li>
<p>An MP3 player so you can audition your MP3s for quality control
before adding them to your permanent archive
</p>
</li><li>
<p>	A digital audio file, compact disc, or live audio stream to encode</p>
</li></ul>
<p>You'll find an abundance of free
<a name="INDEX-1110" />MP3
players and encoders online (see <a href="ch08_08.htm">Section 8.8, "MP3 resources"</a>
later in this chapter for more information).
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">8.4.1. Encoding MP3 files</h3><a name="INDEX-1111" />

<p>Since most encoding is done directly from <a name="INDEX-1112" />compact discs, we'll look at that
process most closely, but keep in mind that most of these steps apply
equally to audio streams coming from pre-existing WAV or AIFF audio
files and to live streams. The single most important thing
you'll need to keep in mind when encoding is the quality level,
or
<a name="INDEX-1113" />bitrate.
Here's a general guideline; a more complete quality comparison
chart is shown in Table 8-1 later in this chapter:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>64 Kbps and below: voice, lectures, streaming over modems</p>
</li><li>
<p>96 Kbps: low-fi music or hi-fi voice (such as newscasts)</p>
</li><li>
<p>128 Kbps: music files destined for Internet distribution</p>
</li><li>
<p>160 Kpbs or 192 Kbps: music files destined for your personal
collection
</p>
</li><li>
<p>256 Kbps or 320 Kbps: files for the most demanding
audiophiles -- virtually perfect quality, but much larger files
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>These bitrates all use the CD-quality 44.1 kHz sample rate, except
the 64 Kbps settings and below, which use lesser rates of 22 kHz and
11 kHz, respectively, to achieve adequate compression for the lower
bitrates.
</p>

<p>In addition, you'll need to decide whether you want to create
CBR or VBR files. <a name="INDEX-1114" /> <a name="INDEX-1115" />
<a name="INDEX-1116" />
<a name="INDEX-1117" />
<a name="INDEX-1118" />CBR
is constant bitrate and generates files in which every frame has the
same bitrate, regardless of the complexity of the passage. Use the
list above to determine a CBR setting. VBR means variable bitrate and
generates files in which the bitrate is different for each frame. In
VBR mode, the bitrate is adjusted dynamically, on the fly, to
accommodate the simplicity or complexity of the passage in question.
In VBR mode, quality thresholds are set by adjusting a slider from
low quality to high quality (much as you would when saving a JPEG
image, adjusting the quality level at output time). In VBR mode, a
setting of 60% to 80% creates files that sound roughly equivalent to
128 Kbps to 160 Kbps CBR files.
</p>

<p>CBR encoding is recommended for general purposes; in our opinion, VBR
doesn't actually win you that much, and CBR files are more
broadly compatible with a wide range of players and are less prone to
glitches and errors. Some encoders create VBR files with track length
written to incorrect portions of the file, which really messes up
some non-mainstream players and players on other operating systems.
</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">VBR files</h4>
<p>Some older MP3 players may not be capable of playing VBR files or may yield inaccurate time/progress indicators. However, most modern players handle VBR files just fine.</p>

<h3 class="sect3">8.4.1.1. Working with the CDDB</h3>

<p>If you've ever played a CD through your computer, you know that
you are presented with only Track 1, Track 2, Track 3, and so on, in
the information window and not with the names of the actual songs.
Many people don't realize that artist, album, and track names
are not on the disc itself. This is where the
<a name="INDEX-1119" /> <a name="INDEX-1120" />
<a name="INDEX-1121" />CDDB
(compact disc database)
<a name="INDEX-1122" />servers
come in to play. On the Internet is a collection of servers that
provide access to an extremely large database of CD titles. If you
run a CDDB-savvy CD or MP3 player or encoder, you have access to the
CD database. When you insert a CD, it is identified by a special
"hash" number, and a few seconds later, the CDDB returns
artist, album, and track names, giving you much more useful
information to work with. The main database is at <a href="../../../../../../www.cddb.com/">http://www.cddb.com</a>, though there are many mirrors
and competing CD database servers out there.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-SIDEBAR-7" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Why is it called "ripping?"</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>The practice of extracting music from an audio CD to a digital audio
file on your hard drive is called
"<a name="INDEX-1123" />ripping."
Why? Because audio CDs don't use a filesystem corresponding to
that of any particular operating system. Your OS's file manager
can't see the tracks as it sees normal files on a data CD, so
you either need to trick your operating system into seeing the
tracks' file "handles" as actual WAV or AIFF files,
or use a special utility to read the raw data from the audio CD and
turn it into a WAV or AIFF file. Because special techniques or tools
are required and you're not doing a straight file copy, another
name for the process was required. No one seems to know where the
term "ripping" originated, but it sounds intuitive and
has been floating around in the computer vernacular for many years.
Don't worry -- ripping is a very simple process, and many
tools completely hide the process for you, so you may not need to
think about it at all.
</p>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>You'll find CDDB lookups so powerful that you probably
won't want to use an encoder without this feature. All the
encoders featured in this chapter contain CDDB. By using a CDDB-savvy
encoder, you can have meaningful ID3 tags (covered later in this
chapter) inserted into your MP3 files automatically, rather than
having to enter them by hand.
</p>

</div>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-SECT-4.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.4.1.2. Getting started</h3>

<p>For the purposes of this chapter, we will encode an MP3 file using
two encoders: Xing
<a name="INDEX-1124" />AudioCatalyst
and MusicMatch
<a name="INDEX-1125" />Jukebox. Xing has
long been a pioneer in MPEG encoding, and its encoding algorithms are
reliable and popular. In fact, MusicMatch also used Xing's
codec in Jukebox until late 1999, when they switched to a slightly
faster and better quality codec from Fraunhofer and Thomson.
Xing's AudioCatalyst also features faster-than-real-time
encoding on modern machines, which is essential if you need to encode
live streams. The downside is that you have to pay for the quality
and extended features, but the price is modest. However, you can
download a trial version of AudioCatalyst at
<a href="../../../../../../www.xingtech.com/">http://www.xingtech.com</a>, so you can try before
you buy.
</p>

<p>The second encoder we will use is MusicMatch Jukebox, a shareware
encoder available at <a href="../../../../../../www.musicmatch.com/">http://www.musicmatch.com</a>.
While early versions of MusicMatch were limited in encoding quality
until you paid for the upgrade, MusicMatch changed their policy in
early 2000; you can now download the free version and get full
CD-quality encoding. MusicMatch Jukebox is an all-in-one ripping
/encoding / playback/database application, and offers very good
encoding capabilities. New users may find MusicMatch a little easier
to use than AudioCatalyst, while more practiced users often gravitate
toward AudioCatalyst.

<h3 class="sect3">8.4.2.1. Selecting tracks</h3>

<p>When you launch
<a name="INDEX-1126" />AudioCatalyst, the first step is to
select the audio file or files you wish to encode. You can encode
files from a hard disk or a CD. If you select Add from CD, a prompt
will ask you to select the file or files to add. If you want all the

important option in this dialog box is the bitrate setting -- use
the guidelines presented earlier to choose CBR or VBR and a quality

stereo/mono options, as described earlier in this chapter. Again, we
recommend <a name="INDEX-1128" />joint
stereo for most purposes.

<p>These default settings have emerged as the general standard with
which the majority of MP3 files on the Internet are encoded, though
128 Kbps won't give you fidelity high enough to satisfy
demanding listeners. Remember, the size of an MP3 file encoded at 128
Kbps is around 11 times smaller than the original, uncompressed audio
file, and maintains a sound quality comparable to CDs. We recommend
160 Kbps for most purposes. Just remember: the higher the bitrate,
the better the audio quality and the bigger the file.
</p>

</div>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-SECT-4.2.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.4.2.3. 128 Kbps Internet standard</h3>

<p>The MP3 quality standard that has emerged for
general<a name="INDEX-1129" />
<a name="INDEX-1130" /> Internet distribution is 128 Kbps,
which maintains near-CD quality sound at a 44.1 kHz
<a name="INDEX-1131" />sampling rate
and provides a fairly good
<a name="INDEX-1132" />quality-to-file-size ratio for Internet
delivery. You can use the next higher encoding levels (160 Kbps or
192 Kbps) for your personal collection or the next lower (112 Kbps)
if you need lower file sizes. Anything higher than 192 Kbps is
overkill for most purposes, and anything lower than 112 Kbps loses
the benefit of high fidelity sound. For perspective, consider that
one minute of stereo 16-bit, 44.1 kHz CD-quality digital audio is
roughly 10 MB, whereas the 128 Kbps encoded MP3 version will occupy
less than 1 MB. At this rate, the average 4 1/2 minute song uses less
than 4 MB, instead of the over 45 MB needed for the standard,
uncompressed 44.1 kHz WAV or AIFF file. At the reduced file size of
128 Kbps, 44.1 kHz MP3 encoding, distributing near CD-quality music
over the Internet is attainable and sensible, even when delivered at
analog modem speeds. <a href="ch08_04.htm">Table 8-1</a> details the
relationship between bitrate, file size, and quality.

<em class="emphasis">ID3 tags</em> are bits of information stored within
the MP3 file itself and are accessible and editable using most of MP3
players. A good MP3 encoding tool will also offer to store ID3 data
within the files it creates as it's running. In other words,

&nbsp;
<p>If you're encoding your own albums, it's a good idea to
include<a name="INDEX-1134" />
<a name="INDEX-1135" /> track numbers from the CD in the
filenames themselves. Without them, the files will appear in the
encoding output directory in alphabetical order, rather than in album
order. But an album is a complete entity, not just a pile of singles.
Artists put a great deal of effort into determining the ideal order
in which tracks should be heard. If you choose to respect this
prerogative of the artist, have your encoder prepend track numbers to
the filenames so they appear in Explorer/Finder/Tracker in the proper
order. When you drag the folder onto your MP3 player, you'll
hear the album as it was meant to be heard, not willy-nilly. And
remember: if there are more than nine tracks on the album,
you'll need to make sure the encoder uses "01"
rather than simply "1." Otherwise, your computer will
order track 10 before track 1, and so on. To control this behavior in
AudioCatalyst, look for the Track Number checkbox in the Naming
section of AudioCatalyst's Settings panel.

2 to 30 seconds (depending on the speed of your connection), your CD
track names and play times are updated and can be included with the

<p>The low-end version of the <a name="INDEX-1146" />Rio comes with 32 MB of rewriteable,
built-in flash memory that holds about 30 to 35 minutes of 128 Kbps
MP3 audio. External flash memory cards can increase playing time and
are available where you purchase the Rio.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>User accounts of the Rio in action are largely positive. Like the
<a name="INDEX-1147" />Sony Walkman of
old, the Rio seems to be defining a lifestyle. With music moving from
disc to chip, the Rio was the first of many players ushering in the
new era of file-based music consumption. Samsung, Sony, Fisher, and
Sanyo have introduced MP3 players similar to the Rio, as well as a
new line-up of other personal home and car audio players.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Another product of interest is called the
<a name="INDEX-1148" />Personal Jukebox PJB-100 from
<a name="INDEX-1149" />HanGo, a Korean
manufacturer. This product holds over 1,000 hours of music on a 4.5
GB internal hard drive. The beauty of this product is that it not
only can it store so much music (roughly 3.2 days of continuous,
nonrepeating music, assuming 128 Kbps files), but it also includes
other handy features. It features a built-in organizer, which is
ID3-ready, allowing easy access and categorization of your music
titles from <a href="../../../../../../www.cddb.com/">http://www.cddb.com</a> databases, including
song title, artist, album, and other information. HanGo's
Personal Jukebox, like similar products, includes its own
ripping/encoding utility.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Yet another product, the <a name="INDEX-1150" />Yamakawa AVPhile 715 player, has taken
the concept one step further and included the ability to play back
multiple formats of audio and video. Besides playback of MP3 files,
this unit will play back
<a name="INDEX-1151" />DVD, CD,
<a name="INDEX-1152" />VCD
(MPEG-1 video), and<a name="INDEX-1153" /> SVCD (MPEG-1 supervideo) files.
This type of player paves the way for a centralized player that is
connected to the Internet and will play all types of media in your
home (or anywhere else for that matter).
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Beyond these new products, larger companies such as Sony, Sanyo, and
Fisher have released next-generation portable and home players. These
devices play both MP3 and other, more secure file formats and are
destined to be compliant with
<a name="INDEX-1154" /> <a name="INDEX-1155" />SDMI (Secure Digital Music
Initiative), which will give music retailers a modicum of
<a name="INDEX-1156" />
<a name="INDEX-1157" /> <a name="INDEX-1158" />security against piracy. One such device
is the sleek and slender Sony Music Clip. It can hold 64 MB of MP3s
(actually, the unit converts your MP3s into the less common but more
efficient ATRAC format) and has a futuristic look, like a small
microphone or fountain pen. However these product lines continue, the
direction has been established. Future MP3 hardware devices will be
smaller, play longer, and hold more music than previous generations
of this new technology.

<h3 class="sect3">8.4.3.2. Specify encoding quality</h3>

<p>As with AudioCatalyst, the default values for MusicMatch are 128bit,
44.1 kHz and are the Internet standard for bitrate and
quality.<a name="INDEX-1159" />
However, if your needs differ and you want to increase the quality or
decrease the file size, you can alter the bitrate and sample rate
accordingly. Again, for personal collections we recommend 160 Kbps or
192 Kbps, 44.1 kHz. For Internet distribution, choose 128 Kbps.
</p>

</div>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-SECT-4.3.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.4.3.3. Encode</h3>

<p>Click the Start
button,<a name="INDEX-1160" />
sit back, and wait for a few minutes while the track is encoded to
MP3. When MusicMatch is finished encoding, you will find the new MP3
files named as the originals, with the <em class="emphasis">.mp3</em>
extension added to each newly encoded file. Your files will appear in
your MusicMatch database automatically. You'll find the actual
files in a subdirectory of the MusicMatch installation directory.
It's poor computing practice to store data files alongside
application files, so we strongly recommend choosing a more neutral
location for MP3 output, such as <em class="emphasis">c:\data\mp3</em>.
You can change the output directory via Options <img height="15" alt="Figure 8.4.3.3" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Recorder
<img height="15" alt="Figure 8.4.3.3" src="figs/U2192.gif" width="19" /> Songs Directory.
</p>

</div>

<a name="sound-CHP-8-SECT-4.3.4" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.4.3.4. Play</h3>

<p>You may now play your MP3 files. This feature can also be performed
within MusicMatch
<a name="INDEX-1161" />Jukebox.
Simply click the Database button found at the bottom of the Recorder
window. This will open the Database window. In the upper-left corner,
you will see a field that says Add Songs From and prompts you with
three choices: CD, Disk, and HTTP://WWW. Click the Disk button. Open
the appropriate directory. In this case, the default directory should
be <em class="filename">C:\Program Files\Brava\MusicMatch
Jukebox\Music</em>. Highlight the tracks you want to add to the
database; if you want to add more than one track, hold down the Shift
or Ctrl key while you select tracks. The database differs from the
playlist in that it holds a listing of all available MP3 files, while
the playlist holds only the tracks ready to go in the play queue.
</p>

<p>When you have highlighted all the tracks you want to add to the
database, click OK. The database window will come up again with the
list of the tracks you selected. Simply double-click the tracks to
add them to the current playlist. When you've finished adding
MP3 files to the database, you can hear any of them by clicking the
Play button.

<a name="sound-CHP-8-SECT-4.3.5" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">8.4.3.5. CDDB database support</h3>

<p>Also included in MusicMatch is
<a name="INDEX-1162" />CDDB
support, as described earlier in this chapter. This option allows you
connect to the online CD database at <a href="../../../../../../www.cddb.com/">http://www.cddb.com</a>, as shown in <a href="ch08_04.htm">Figure 8-13</a>, to automatically include artist, album, and
track information with your encoded files. This feature is a great
time-saver because it relieves you from having to locate and enter
the appropriate track information for <a name="INDEX-1163" />each track on a given CD.
