<p>When you have captured your audio source material, there are three critical steps to take before you integrate audio into your web site: 
</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Perform basic sound editing to remove undesirable recording takes and
unwanted artifacts, such as coughs or sneezes.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Add digital effects enhancements, such as
<a name="INDEX-340" />reverb,
<a name="INDEX-341" />delay, and
<a name="INDEX-342" />pitch-shifting
to amplify your soundtrack.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Apply web mastering techniques to optimize your sound files for web
compression and delivery.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>You can perform basic<a name="INDEX-343" />
sound editing with any digital audio application that has routine
cut, paste, and fade features. The sound-editing application we will
refer to in this chapter is Macromedia's
<a name="INDEX-344" />SoundEdit 16
(Macintosh and Windows). However, the concepts we discuss are the
same for any basic sound editor, including
<a name="INDEX-345" />CoolEdit (Windows),
<a name="INDEX-346" />Sound Forge by
<a name="INDEX-347" />Sonic Foundry
(Windows), and <a name="INDEX-348" />Pro
Tools by <a name="INDEX-349" />Avid
(Macintosh and Windows NT).
</p>

<p>Applying <a name="INDEX-350" />digital effects to your sound files is
the most creative editing step, but it can also be the most confusing
and troublesome. You can, for example, add too many effects and
quickly lose track of what you've done to a file or how to
backtrack to an earlier state. You can also add subtle effects such
as reverb, delay, and equalization, or apply more drastic,
sound-altering effects such as pitch-shifting, time expansion, and
reverse. Learning which digital effects to use, and how and when to
use them, takes practice and experimentation. In this chapter,
you'll find guidelines to help fine-tune your application of
digital effects.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-351" />Web mastering
is the final optimization process before you encode your sound files
into a web format. Audio files need to be custom-tailored for their
respective output mediums: radio, film, television, home stereos, and
of course the Internet. In this chapter, we will also discuss the
techniques used to prepare sound files for digital delivery, drawing
from traditional CD mastering techniques such as normalization and
equalization.
</p>

<p>By removing unwanted artifacts and glitches, applying the appropriate
effects, and properly mastering your sound files, you greatly enhance
your web soundtrack or voice-over. This chapter familiarizes you with
all three of these techniques which will help bring the overall
quality of your sound files up to professional broadcast standards.
</p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="sound-CHP-4-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">4.1. Basic sound editing</h2>

<p>After capturing your raw source material, you'll probably have
to remove unavoidable, extraneous noises such as pops or clicks,
system noise, 60 Hz electrical hum, or throat-clearing noises and
coughs.
</p>

<p>Properly cleaning up a <a name="INDEX-352" />sound
file can be a time-consuming process. To capture the cleanest signal
possible, you should start with a recording that has good dynamic
range, optimized levels, and little system noise. Remember, the
higher the quality of the original recording, the better the final
edited version will sound when compressed for web delivery. A few
extra minutes of planning in the recording studio can save you hours
later in the editing studio.

<h3 class="sect2">4.1.1. Choosing takes and removing artifacts</h3>

<p>Recording multiple <a name="INDEX-353" />takes of the same sound passage
isn't neurotic,
<a name="INDEX-354" />
<a name="INDEX-355" />it's
wise. Once in the editing suite, select the take that sounds best,
then edit or delete
<a name="INDEX-356" />artifacts
that may have occurred before, during, or after recording. For
example, remove the throat-clearing and breathing sounds that occur
before someone begins speaking and the miscellaneous studio noises,
such as a microphone stand being adjusted, that occur right before a
recording session.
</p>

<p>You can do this easily by watching the waveform as you listen to the
sound, highlighting the section where the noise occurs and then
clicking the delete or silence command in your audio editor.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-4-SECT-1.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.1.2. Avoiding gaps between edited sections</h3>

<p>After you<a name="INDEX-357" /> cut out the major artifacts and
reassemble the best takes into a contiguous sound file or audio
region, smooth out the
<a name="INDEX-358" />silences or
<a name="INDEX-359" />pauses, keeping a
consistent room tone in between phrases and passages of music. Room
tone is the natural ambient sound in any given environment, such as a
subtle background wind outdoors or the distant hum of an indoor
generator or fan.
</p>

<p>Even the vibration of "silence" varies from room to room.
All sound files also have an inherent <a name="INDEX-360" />noise floor or a certain amount of
<a name="INDEX-361" />system noise.
It is nearly impossible to capture an absolutely silent signal. Thus,
if you simply delete an artifact, there will be a small gap of
perceptible <a name="INDEX-362" />dead
space with low-level system noise in between the "silent"
passages. (This gap is especially noticeable with headphones or a
high-fidelity sound system.) To compensate for this effect, record
about 20 to 30 seconds of <a name="INDEX-363" />room tone or low-level system noise and
paste this over any artifacts. This process eliminates the dead-air
syndrome. A sound file that starts with a room tone recording is
shown in <a href="ch04_01.htm">Figure 4-1</a>.

<a name="sound-CHP-4-SECT-1.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.1.3. Removing embedded artifacts</h3>

<p>The final and most difficult step at this stage is to remove unwanted
<a name="INDEX-364" /> <a name="INDEX-365" />artifacts embedded within passages of
music or voice-over phrases. Such artifacts must be carefully removed
or reduced in volume without affecting the desired sound. In some
cases, if the unwanted artifact occupies only a few milliseconds of
time, you can simply delete that portion without detecting any major
difference in the playback of the sound file. In most cases, however,
you will have to settle for reducing the amplitude or volume of the
spike or unwanted region to avoid a perceptible gap or glitch.
</p>

<p>For longer playing artifacts, here are a few other techniques. </p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Beware of degradation</h4>
<p>Removing embedded artifacts requires a delicate trade-off between allowing for some form of file degradation to fix the error and keeping the original, louder, more noticeable glitch. Regardless, be aware that the process of using volume and EQ to remove unwanted noises overlaying a mix of other sounds causes some form of degradation to your sound file.</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-SECT-1.3.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.1.3.1. Deleting a spike</h3>

<p>To remove a large
<a name="INDEX-366" />spike
from an audio
<a name="INDEX-367" />waveform, use the
<a name="INDEX-368" />zoom-in command until you locate and
select the offending waveform. Audition the selection first to make
certain that you have identified only the portion of sound you want
to remove. Next, simply hit the delete key to remove the section.
<a href="ch04_01.htm">Figure 4-2</a> shows a sound file with a spike at the
beginning and the same file with the spike removed.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img height="159" alt="Figure 4-2" src="figs/aud.0402.gif" width="402" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 4-2. A waveform spike in an audio file (left) and the fixed file with the spike deleted (right) </h4>

</div>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-SECT-1.3.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.1.3.2. Amplitude reduction</h3>

<p>Cutting out an
<a name="INDEX-369" />entire
portion of audio often results in an
unacceptable<a name="INDEX-370" /> glitch when the two ends are spliced
back together. If you have a loud waveform spike that cannot simply
be removed from the middle of an important section, you will have to
settle for volume, or amplitude, reduction. The idea is simply to
reduce the volume of the specific selection in order to minimize the
noise in relation to the rest of the sound clip.
</p>

<p>First, select the artifact and try reducing its volume by -3dB to
-9dB so that it stays just under the volume of your room tone. Select
the section of noise from your waveform and choose the Amplify
command. Enter a very low value like 5% or 10%. This reduces the
selected waveform by a substantial amount. Compare the reduced spike
in <a href="ch04_01.htm">Figure 4-3</a> to the one in <a href="ch04_01.htm">Figure 4-2</a>. Avoid reducing the volume below the inherent
room noise, however, as this will produce a noticeable gap or change
in volume when the sound file is played back.
</p>

<p>The best way to determine the right volume level is to watch the
contour of the waveform in your editing window. Locate the spike in
the waveform, then reduce it to the level of the surrounding room
tone. Although this technique does not remove the glitch entirely, it
makes it is less noticeable and in some cases almost imperceptible.

</div>

<a name="sound-CHP-4-SECT-1.3.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.1.3.3. Equalization</h3>

<p>Another commonly used method for removing artifacts while preserving
the underlying sound file is <a name="INDEX-371" />
<a name="INDEX-372" />equalization.
Equalization is a more precise method for altering the gain or
"volume" of a limited set of frequencies within an audio
region. It is used as an alternative to globally reducing the volume
of all the frequencies. For example, certain artifacts, such as wind
noise or the sound of bumping a microphone stand, are diminished by
reducing the frequencies below 60 Hz and 80 Hz. Reducing certain high
frequencies is also useful for
"<a name="INDEX-373" />de-essing,"
or removing over-pronounced "sss" sounds during a
voice-over recording.
</p>

<p>To boost or cut the frequency range of an unwanted artifact, audition
the sound file in loop playback mode. Adjust the frequency slider
that corresponds to the type of sound you are trying to <a name="INDEX-374" />alter (boost or
cut), <a name="INDEX-375" /> <a name="INDEX-376" />as <a name="INDEX-377" />shown in <a href="ch04_01.htm">Figure 4-4</a>.

The Equalization reduction process allows you to use the equalizer to cut or decrease frequencies of a particular sound. In this example, the frequencies are reduced in the 1.2, 3.2, and 8.1 kHz frequency range. </h4>
