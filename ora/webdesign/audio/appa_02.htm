<h2 class="sect1">A.2. Designing a studio with proper acoustics</h2>

<p>The first and largest component of the ultimate web sound studio is
the room itself. <a name="INDEX-1505" />A proper recording environment with
pleasing acoustics and no echo or noise is essential to high-quality
recording. (For more information about optimum room acoustics, see
<a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Capturing Original Source Material"</a>.) Successfully building a great sound
studio depends largely on having the proper budget to design and
remodel a room from scratch or the ingenuity to repurpose an existing
room on a budget.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Pro option</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Money <a name="INDEX-1506" />and
space permitting, most professional recording studios are customized
from the ground up to have the ideal acoustics and optimum recording
functionality. Professional studios generally have a minimum of two
rooms: a control room for mixing and monitoring and a soundproof
recording room for capturing the audio signal. The control room is
where the audio engineer resides during a recording or mix-down
session and contains mixing boards, a digital audio workstation,
studio reference monitors, and so on. The recording room is where the
musicians, voice-over artists, and microphones reside. Generally, the
control room is directly adjacent to the recording room with a
soundproof window built in-between so the engineer can supervise
microphone placement and communicate with the recording artists.
</p>

<p>Professional studios optimize good room acoustics by placing
high-frequency-absorbing audio-grade foam on the walls and ceilings,
bass baffles and traps on the floors and corners, and reflective
hardwood floors for warmth and pleasing reverberation.
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Budget option</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Building a <a name="INDEX-1507" />sound studio on a shoestring budget
takes ingenuity and resourcefulness. Most web professionals and audio
enthusiasts will have neither the luxury of building a room from the
ground up nor an extensive budget to equip it with acoustic foam,
bass traps, or sound isolation booths. For people with a limited
budget, converting an existing square or rectangular room in their
home or production offices into a dedicated sound studio is their
only option. If you have one room for recording, mixing, and
monitoring, the first step is to isolate and place any noisy,
fan-cooled hard drives or power amps into a padded box or a closet
with enough air circulation around the components.
</p>

<p>Once you reduce any extraneous noise that can leak into your
microphones during recording, place bookshelves, file cabinets, wall
hangings, or other large objects against the walls to reduce echo and
slap-back. If the ceiling and floor are parallel, place a rug on the
floor or a tapestry on the ceiling to further reduce slap-back and
echo.

<h3 class="sect2">A.2.1. Microphones </h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-1508" />Microphones
<a name="INDEX-1509" />capture
and convert sound waves into electrical impulses. A good microphone
is one of the first components you will need if you plan on recording
voice-overs or live music. You will want to choose a microphone that
has an extended high-frequency response and a low signal-to-noise
ratio. A high-quality microphone should capture the entire audio
spectrum of the human hearing range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz with a low
11dB of self noise. Inexpensive microphones generally only capture
the frequencies between 50 Hz to 15 kHz and add a lot of noise into
the audio signal.
</p>

<a name="sound-APP-A-SECT-2.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">A.2.1.1. Pro option</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, the more expensive the microphone, the more
accurately it reproduces sound waves and the more features it
contains. A large diaphragm <a name="INDEX-1510" />
<a name="INDEX-1511" />condenser
microphone with at least two or three polar patterns, preferably omni
and cardioid, is the industry standard for recording voice-overs and
acoustic instruments. As far as all-around performance, reliability,

<h4 class="objtitle">Professional versus consumer grade equipment</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>Bear in mind that professional gear, as the name implies, is designed
for people who are making money from audio production.
<a name="INDEX-1512" />This means at minimum a studio with at
least $20,000 to $50,000 worth of equipment. Professional gear is
expensive for a reason -- it is generally not mass-produced and
contains electrical components that have been handcrafted and
oft-tested.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>If you find an inexpensive piece of equipment that claims to do
everything, the price is probably too good to be true. Most likely
the manufacturer is cutting corners with low-grade electrical
components or simply misleading the consumer. The recent trend in
consumer-grade audio equipment is to pack every piece of gear with
the most possible features -- compression, EQ, reverb, and so on.
This often leads to more system noise and makes the piece of
equipment more difficult to use when trying to get a quick task done
under pressure.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Look for equipment that is known for doing one thing really well. You
will find the audio quality is better, and the tool is easier to use.

<p>If you cannot afford to spend $1,000 on a large diaphragm
<a name="INDEX-1513" /> <a name="INDEX-1514" />condenser microphone, some of the small
diaphragm electrets give fine sound at a budget price. (The

<p>There are
<a name="INDEX-1515" />occasions
when <a name="INDEX-1516" />dynamic microphones are an
advantage over more expensive, sensitive condenser mics. They are
nearly indestructible, and they do not capture as much distant
ambient room noise or feedback from studio speakers. To get the best
recording quality from less-sensitive dynamic microphones, place the
mic within six inches of the sound source and make sure you are
getting the "hottest" or loudest possible

<h3 class="sect2">A.2.2. Mic pre-amps</h3>

<p>A mic pre-amp boosts the weak <a name="INDEX-1520" />output signal of a
<a name="INDEX-1521" />microphone, just as a telephoto lens
magnifies the image of a regular camera lens. A good mic pre-amp is
the most overlooked component in the recording studio. Novices and
beginners alike usually find it easy to understand why a good
microphone is necessary for high-quality recording, but few
comprehend why mic pre-amps are just as important.
</p>

<p>When it comes to choosing one or the other, the microphone always
comes first. But a high-quality outboard mic pre-amp should always
accompany your investment in a good condenser microphone. Without a
mic pre-amp, you will not reap the full benefit of a
professional-grade microphone.
</p>

<a name="sound-APP-A-SECT-2.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">A.2.2.1. Pro option</h3>

<p>Most professional studios utilize separate, high-quality outboard mic
pre-amps, or expensive mixing consoles, which have built-in
high-quality mic pre-amps. These components start at $30,000.
</p>

<p>The difference between a high-quality mic pre-amp and a poor-quality
one is the output clarity and purity of an amplified low-level
microphone input signal. A high-quality mic pre-amp magnifies every
nuance and subtlety of a microphone signal without introducing noise.
A cheap mic pre-amp, like the ones found in most 16-channel mixers,
introduces system noise into the signal path and easily overloads and
distorts loud input signals.
</p>

<p>A few good mic pre-amps include:</p>

<ul><li>

the built-in mic pre-amps on your mixing board. The Mackie MS1202 12
channel mixer has four built-in mic pre-amps and sells for only $369.
If you have to use the built-in mic pre-amp on your mixing board, try
to ensure that the signal going into the microphone is as
"hot" as possible. The "hotter" (or louder)
the signal entering the microphone, the less the mic pre-amp has to
boost the signal. Move the microphone closer to the sound source or
ask someone to speak or play louder. A few to consider are:

<h3 class="sect2">A.2.3. Compressor/limiters</h3>

<p>A<a name="INDEX-1523" />compressor,
<a name="INDEX-1524" />as
the names implies, is used to even out and compress incoming audio
signals that vary greatly in dynamic range. An example is a singer
going from a soft whisper to a resounding scream. A compressor allows
for the hottest incoming signal possible to your sound card without
distorting it by limiting the sounds that peak above the
0dB-distortion range. By reducing the amplitude of the loudest sounds
with a compressor you can increase the input level of your microphone
to get a hotter recording. Compressors are used widely in pop music
where the aesthetic dictates that the overall volume and presence of
each instrument remain consistent throughout the mix. Compressors are
not as ubiquitous in classical or jazz music, where a wider dynamic
range is preferable. However, in the age of hard-disk recording,
compressors have become a necessity to avoid digital distortion.

<p>A MIDI <a name="INDEX-1537" />
<a name="INDEX-1538" />
<a name="INDEX-1539" />sequencer
is an important component to the web audio studio if you plan to
compose music with several synthesizers or tone generators. In the
past few years, the industry has seen a convergence between MIDI and
digital audio applications. It is now standard to buy one
application, such as Studio Vision Pro or Logic Audio, that records
both MIDI data and digital audio. The number of simultaneous MIDI and
audio playback tracks depends on your computer hardware, CPU speed,
and external I/O sound card.
</p>

<p>The MIDI component of a sequencer functions like a standard digital
audio application with all the familiar controls -- record, stop,
play, fast forward, rewind, loop mode, and so on. However, a MIDI
sequencer does not actually record the sound output of a synthesizer.
It merely records the actions that triggered certain sounds, much the
same as an old-time piano role.
</p>

<p>Because a sequencer records actions only as text-based commands, it
has many speed and editing advantages over hard-disk recording. A
10-minute MIDI composition with 4 separate playback tracks takes only
40 KB on your hard disk, while the same digital audio file requires a
giant 200 MB in disk space.
</p>

<p>The main disadvantage to MIDI is that you can playback and record
only the limited palette of sounds stored inside your synthesizer.
MIDI cannot store, record, or transmit digital sounds. If you record
voice-overs or live instruments, you will have to use the digital
audio hard-disk recording feature of your MIDI sequencer. Note that
most companies offer free trial demos of their MIDI software packages
on the Web.

<p>Avoid synths that have built-in sequencers; you will not need them if
you use a computer-based MIDI sequencer application. There are a huge
variety of keyboards on the market that cater to a wide range of
tastes. Spend a good amount of time listening to the built-in presets
and features before you buy. If you are purchasing your first
keyboard, buy one that produces a wide range of sounds, from piano to
strings to percussion.

<p>Professional keyboards have weighted piano keys, extra RAM for
longer-playing waveform samples, a minimum of 64 voice polyphony (64
simultaneous MIDI instruments), additional DSP chips for
ultrarealistic audio replication, and some method or form of input
card for importing custom digital samples. If you have several
synthesizers, as is common in professional studios, you will need to
purchase an additional MIDI patchbay to route the MIDI signals to
your MIDI controller.

<h3 class="sect2">A.2.7. Mixers </h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-1545" />
<a name="INDEX-1546" />mixer is
the Grand Central Station of the sound studio. Audiomixing boards connect and route all the input
and output signals from one component to another. Mixing boards also
have signal processing capabilities such as equalization and effects
for outboard reverb and delay. Mixers save you from the headache and
hassle of patching together different pieces of equipment for common,
day-to-day studio tasks. Mixers are often used for routing output
signals from a DAT machine, CD player, or microphone into a sound
card and back out to a set of studio reference monitors.
</p>

<a name="sound-APP-A-SIDEBAR-5" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Five tips for selecting the best audio equipment retailer</h4>
&nbsp;
<ol><li>
<p>Get a recommendation from <a name="INDEX-1547" />someone
you trust. When you get a good recommendation, make sure to get the
name of a specific salesperson. When you speak with the salesperson,
mention the name of the customer who referred you.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check to see if the company has a high employee turnover rate. Ask
the salespeople how long they have worked at the company.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go in with a question you know the answer to, to see if the
salesperson gives you an honest response. The salesperson should be
knowledgeable enough to properly answer your questions. Especially
make sure they are up-to-speed on digital audio. Ask a salesperson
what MIDI stands for and see if they give you an informative answer.
They should at least tell you that MIDI stands for Musical Instrument
Digital Interface.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call the Better Business Bureau to find out if any complaints have
been filed against the company.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, check out a music
<a name="INDEX-1548" />retailer's commitment to
customer service. A good music retailer will help you buy the product
you need, even if they have to refer you to another retailer who has
the item in stock. An honest retailer will ask questions to find out
what components suit your needs instead of only pointing you in the
direction of overstocked items the store wants to push. Ask the
salesperson if he or she has to meet sales quotas. A
consumer-friendly retailer will not have sales quotas. (Remember that
all sales people have some type of commission plan, but not all
stores implement sales quotas.) Generally, the large nationwide
retail outlets have high sales quotas and heavy employee turnover.
Finally, call them on the phone before you go in and see if they are
responsive to your questions.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Once you find a good audio equipment dealer and have purchased your
gear, stay in touch with the salesperson. A good salesperson will be
more than happy to provide information and technical help. The more a
salesperson gets to know you, the more likely he or she will give you
honest and straightforward answers. Do not ask 30 minutes of
questions and then run across town to buy the same item for 5 bucks
less elsewhere.

<p>The key component of a mixing board is the
<a name="INDEX-1549" /> <a name="INDEX-1550" />signal-to-noise (s/n) ratio, measured
in dB. A good mixer will introduce less noise into the signal than a
poor one. The best way to tell if a mixer has low noise is to plug in
some headphones or monitor speakers, turn up all the faders on the
board without turning on any sound, and then turn up the main output
levels. If you hear excessive hiss and noise, then the mixer has a
poor s/n ratio. If you hear only a little or none at all, then the
mixer has a good s/n ratio.

<p>Professional-grade mixers use good electronic components for every
knob, circuit, and switch to avoid adding system noise into the audio
signal. One of the key components of good mixer is high-quality mic
pre-amps. Expensive mic pre-amps can drive up the price of a good
mixer considerably because a mixer needs a mic pre-amp for every
input channel.

<p>Low-end mixers use cheaper components and produce more system noise.
Even a relatively small 12-channel mixer has over 400 knobs,
switches, and inputs alone, excluding the internal circuitry. Unless
manufacturers are paying pennies for these components, they cannot
make a profit on a $500 mixer. Compared to 10 years ago, the gap in
sound quality between super high-end models and low-end models is
closing. Most studios, with the exception of a few high-end venues,
use Mackie mixers.

<p>Any of the new
<a name="INDEX-1551" />
<a name="INDEX-1552" />
<a name="INDEX-1553" />digital mixers can boost the audio
quality of a studio. One reason for this is that the audio signal
remains entirely in digital form once it enters the mixer and is
routed through various internal effects without the degradation
caused by repeated digital-to-analog (D/A) and analog-to-digital
(A/D) conversions. Although the price tag may seem hefty, digital
mixers are a bargain for a new installation because they include many
channels of high-quality compression and other effects that otherwise
would have to be purchased as separate pieces of gear. They also
offer snapshot and synchronized automation features that make
recording sessions very efficient.

<p>High-quality <a name="INDEX-1556" />studio reference
<a name="INDEX-1557" />speakers, or monitors, accurately
reproduce a "flat," transparent representation of your
audio without adding coloration, distortion, noise, or equalization.
Consumer stereo speakers, by contrast, are designed to boost the high
and low audio frequencies to sound good on the sales floor. Unlike
home stereo speakers, reference speakers are designed to give you the
most accurate sound, not the most pleasant.
</p>

<p>Experienced engineers rely on their favorite reference speakers to
give them a consistent reference to their sound. They rely on the
same reference speakers or a set of speakers every time they mix-down
their audio tracks. Serious engineers will even bring their favorite
reference monitors along from one recording studio to another. Just
as every computer monitor screen displays colors slightly
differently, every brand of studio "near field" reference
speakers produce a slightly different sound. Most good-quality
reference speakers give an accurate, "flat"
representation of the audio frequency spectrum.
</p>

<p>The most important step is to use the same set of speakers every time
you listen to your audio mixes. A favorite trick of savvy recording
engineers is to play popular CDs on their reference speakers to hear
how other mixes sound on their system.

the power going to your speakers is always the right amount (often
standalone power amps deliver too much or too little power to your
speakers); and it's easier to transport self-powered speakers
if you travel to another studio.

effects processors offer the sound designer a world of possibilities
that were once cost-prohibitive or completely impossible. As more

processing will be performed solely through software plug-ins instead
of outboard gear. For the time being, most people find it more

<p>A <a name="INDEX-1564" />DAT is <a name="INDEX-1565" />a miniaturized version of a VHS tape

certain that clients will bring you their audio source materials on a
DAT at some point in time. If you are creating a professional studio,
you will need a DAT player.
</p>

<p>If you are on a tight budget and do not plan on working with high-end
clients, you can skip the DAT player and mix-down your audio to
stereo master files for storage on a hard disk or backup storage
