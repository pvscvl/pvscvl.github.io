<h2 class="sect1">5.2. Streaming media formats</h2>

<p>There are currently more than a dozen formats for streaming audio
over the Web, from widely used formats, such as RealNetworks'
RealAudio, streaming MP3,
<a name="INDEX-484" />Macromedia's
Flash and <a name="INDEX-485" />Director Shockwave, Microsoft's
Windows Media, and Apple's QuickTime, to more recent entries
that synchronize sounds with events on a web page, such as
<a name="INDEX-486" />RealMedia G2 with
<a name="INDEX-487" />SMIL and Beatnik's
<a name="INDEX-488" />Rich
Music Format (RMF). Also included are a host of downloadable formats,
including <a name="INDEX-489" />Liquid Audio, MP3,
<a name="INDEX-490" />MIDI, <a name="INDEX-491" />WAV, and <a name="INDEX-492" />AU.
</p>

<p>While the high quality of MP3 has sent shockwaves through the
recording industry,<a name="INDEX-493" /> <a name="INDEX-494" /> streaming formats like RealAudio
remain the dominant audio technology on the Web right now. Indeed MP3
is being folded into multimedia streaming formats like QuickTime and
Windows Media.
</p>

<p>Throughout this book, we take an in-depth look at many of the more
prevalent streaming formats. However, in this chapter, we will review
all the streaming formats on the Web, including Windows Media and
QuickTime, which are not featured in later chapters.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.1. RealMedia and RealAudio</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-495" />
<a name="INDEX-496" />RealMedia
is the most widely adopted streaming media format on the Web. Its
popularity is due in large part to the fact that it was the first
streaming technology on the market. But it's popular also
because of RealNetworks' laser focus on ease of use, deployment
of a wide palette of developer tools, continuous support for the
latest multimedia technologies, and support for both Windows and Unix
platforms. RealMedia is the format of choice for professionals who
want advanced controls for serving, tracking, and managing large
numbers of audio streams.
<a name="INDEX-497" />RealNetworks
has been a trailblazer in making advanced server features, which were
once accessible only to those with advanced programming skills,
available to the public.
</p>

<p>And RealMedia is likely to attract more fans as web developers begin
to use the RealSystem G2 and SMIL to stream
<a name="INDEX-498" /> <a name="INDEX-499" />synchronized
multimedia presentations over the Web. G2's major advance is
the ability to simultaneously stream multiple media types as separate
files instead of as one RealMedia-encoded file. This makes updating
multimedia content easier, since you can simply upload one element of
a presentation instead of re-encoding the whole media file.
</p>

<p>Perhaps the most powerful feature of<a name="INDEX-500" />
RealSystem G2 is RealNetworks' server architecture.
Broadcasting audio with a dedicated RealServer provides the following
advantages over HTTP pseudo-streaming from a standard web server:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Bandwidth negotiation</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Ensures that all users receive the appropriate encoded content for
the best audio quality at their available bandwidth, from slower
analog modems to faster cable or xDSL connections. RealSystem
G2's new SureStream technology is even more efficient than
bandwidth negotiation. SureStream can dynamically change data rates
midstream to accommodate fluctuating bandwidth.
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Robust RTSP transmission </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Detects and compensates for lost packets, maintaining
<a name="INDEX-501" />smooth, continuous audio
playback -- something that HTTP streaming can't deliver.
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Splitting </b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-502" />Allows for
splitting and routing the audio signal from one RealServer to other
RealServers located at different points across the Internet.
</p>
</dd><dt><b>Clustering </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Allows<a name="INDEX-503" /> multiple
RealServers to be clustered together so they work as a single,
multiprocessor machine.
</p>
</dd><dt><b>IP multicasting </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Allows all users of a<a name="INDEX-504" /> network
to listen to a single live stream, making efficient use of network
resources. Multicasting avoids delivering numerous simultaneous
point-to-point connections by broadcasting one stream to a certain
point in the network where other users are requesting the same file.
Multicasting is ideal for reducing server load and bandwidth
congestion during live broadcasts.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>While RealMedia's powerful server-side architecture supports
and manages robust streaming to large audiences, this core strength
results in limited interactivity. Like Windows Media and other
server-side streaming technologies, RealMedia waits for a request
from a listener's browser before it begins to stream media
files. This helps RealMedia negotiate bandwidth congestion on the fly
by sending an appropriate size stream that matches the
listener's real bandwidth. But it also produces a significant
time gap of a few seconds between the listener's request and
the response from the server. This small time gap is inconsequential
with long-playing video and audio files, but it prohibits the use of
interactive sound effects such as button rollovers, sound transitions
from one page to another, and loops that must respond instantaneously
to a mouse click.
</p>

<p>Thus, RealMedia is inappropriate for high impact presentations with
interactive sound effects and loops. Despite significant advancements
in RealSystem G2, RealAudio still trails Flash and Director Shockwave
when it comes to smooth playback of high-impact interactive
multimedia. High-powered interactive media requires a client-side
solution such as Flash, Shockwave, or Beatnik.
</p>

<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.2. Windows Media Technologies (Netshow)</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-505" />
<a name="INDEX-506" />Microsoft's Windows Media
Technologies for NT/Windows 2000 includes a
<a name="INDEX-507" /> <a name="INDEX-508" />comprehensive suite of authoring tools
and streaming services for delivering audio, video, animation, and
other multimedia over the Internet. Windows Media comes with a
complete set of tools for encoding and authoring streaming content
including <a name="INDEX-509" />Windows
Media T.A.G.Author, a utility for
arranging media elements along a timeline. Windows Media
presentations are played back with the<a name="INDEX-510" /> Windows
Media Player, which plays most local and streamed media file types
including <a name="INDEX-511" />Advanced Streaming Format (Windows'
native file format), <a name="INDEX-512" />MPEG, <a name="INDEX-513" />WAV,
<a name="INDEX-514" />AVI,
<a name="INDEX-515" />QuickTime, and RealAudio/RealVideo.
Since Media Player is distributed with Windows, it has widespread
distribution.
</p>

<p>If you need a <a name="INDEX-516" />Windows NT 4.0-based solution, Windows
Media Services offers several advantages:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The <a name="INDEX-517" />Windows Media Server comes free with
unlimited streams with Windows NT Server 4.0 and later.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>It allows for better playback over machines running Windows. To
enable smooth multimedia playback over the Web and avoid the
problematic issue of cumbersome plug-in downloads altogether,
Microsoft is moving towards integrating Windows Media Player, along
with Internet Explorer, directly into the Windows operating system.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Windows Media Server integrates with
<a name="INDEX-518" />Microsoft Site Server to enable
pay-per-view and pay-per-minute billing capabilities,
<a name="INDEX-519" />usage analysis reporting, and
<a name="INDEX-520" />personalized ad insertion.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tools for tracking behavior are tightly integrated with the Windows
NT Event Viewer and Performance Monitor, making it easy for seasoned
NT administrators to manage the Windows Media Server.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>For multimedia content developers, Microsoft provides helpful
authoring tools. Creating a slide show of images with synchronized
audio can be accomplished by using the Windows Media T.A.G. Author.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Compared to <a name="INDEX-521" />RealMedia, however,
<a name="INDEX-522" />Windows Media has some serious
drawbacks:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p>It runs only on Windows NT/2000. Many developers have reported
problems with the stability of Windows NT for mission-critical
applications such as 24-hour live broadcasts. This can be a
show-stopper for those who demand the stability of
<a name="INDEX-523" />Unix or
<a name="INDEX-524" />Linux servers. In
contrast, RealNetworks supports NT as well as Linux,
<a name="INDEX-525" />FreeBSD,
<a name="INDEX-526" />Solaris, and
<a name="INDEX-527" />IRIX.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>It does not support Macromedia Flash or the
<a name="INDEX-528" />
<a name="INDEX-529" />Synchronized Multimedia Integration
Language (SMIL) standard, both of which are supported by
RealNetworks.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>There are also some key differences in the way Windows Media and
RealMedia encode and deliver multimedia content. With RealMedia, you
can create multimedia presentations by using the SMIL markup language
to connect various media elements together. These media elements are
encoded as separate files:
<a name="INDEX-530" />RealAudio,
<a name="INDEX-531" />RealVideo,
<a name="INDEX-532" />RealPix, <a name="INDEX-533" />RealText,
<a name="INDEX-534" />QuickTime,
MPEG, and so on. The
<a name="INDEX-535" />
<a name="INDEX-536" />RealServer, much
the same way a standard web page is served up and delivered, then
streams the presentation as separate media files held together by
SMIL.
</p>

<p>"Since G2 developers are creating multimedia presentations
rather than simply encoding audio or video streams, the format has a
new level of complexity," says Leah Goldberg, G2 media producer
for CMPnet. "However, web developers have long been familiar
with the flexibility and convenience of this approach to media
delivery. The challenge with G2," Goldberg claims, "is
working out the timing in the component RealPix, RealText, and
<a name="INDEX-537" />RealFlash files.
Since the idea is to synchronize all the different media elements
together, working out the sub-timing issues within each of the
component files can be quite complex."
</p>

<p>In contrast, Windows Media wraps all media elements into one
<a name="INDEX-538" />
<a name="INDEX-539" />Active Streaming File (ASF),
Microsoft's proprietary streaming media format. According to
Microsoft, with ASF any object can be placed into an ASF data stream,
including audio and video, scripts,
<a name="INDEX-540" />ActiveX controls, and
<a name="INDEX-541" />HTML documents with T.A.G. Author. This
approach, similar to Flash and Shockwave movies, provides less
flexibility in terms of updating and serving content, but it offers
more stable client-side playback of various media elements and
tighter authoring controls. For more information about creating
<a name="INDEX-542" />ASF content, visit the Microsoft web site.
Microsoft provides free code to members <a name="INDEX-543" /> <a name="INDEX-544" />of its Developer Network.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.3. QuickTime</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-545" />
<a name="INDEX-546" />
<a name="INDEX-547" />Apple
Computer's QuickTime enables the delivery and playback of
video, audio,
<a name="INDEX-548" />animation,
<a name="INDEX-549" />3-D,
and <a name="INDEX-550" />panoramic images for Macintosh and
Windows. QuickTime is also the leading video production platform for
both Windows and Macintosh. Most multimedia on computers begins with
or involves QuickTime. Accordingly, the QuickTime technology is a
natural for high-quality audio and video playback over the Web.
Similar to Windows Media, QuickTime does not charge licensing fees
for the number of simultaneous streams served. QuickTime can be
streamed from the <a name="INDEX-551" />Mac OS X Server, the
<a name="INDEX-552" />Darwin Streaming Media Server, and
RealNetworks' RealServer 8.0.
</p>

<p>The latest version, QuickTime 4, features many enhancements including:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Smaller "component" codec architecture so that the
initial download is as low as 1.7 MB. Additional codecs are
transparently downloaded in the background when required for a
specific media element on a page.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Support for an increased number of formats, including
<a name="INDEX-553" />MP3,
<a name="INDEX-554" />Flash,
<a name="INDEX-555" />MIDI,
and almost every audio, video, animation, 3-D, and
<a name="INDEX-556" />virtual reality format available.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Improved codecs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>True RTSP streaming when used in conjunction with the Mac OS X Server.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>One of the keys to the success of the QuickTime technology and
plug-in is that it can handle all types of media elements. For those
of you trying to design for the greatest number of users and the
least number of plug-ins, this can be a significant benefit.
</p>

<p>In addition to playing MP3 content, QuickTime supports Timecode
tracks as well as MIDI standards, including the
<a name="INDEX-557" />Roland
Sound Canvas and <a name="INDEX-558" />GS format extensions. QuickTime also
supports key standards for web streaming, including HTTP, RTP, and
RTSP. Plus, QuickTime supports every major file format for images,
including JPEG, BMP, PICT, PNG, and GIF. QuickTime also features
built-in support for digital video, including MiniDV, DVCPro, and
DVCam camcorder formats, as well as support for AVI, AVR, MPEG-1, and
OpenDML.
</p>

<p>Finally, the newly designed interface is attractive and user
friendly. In addition to the traditional controls you'd expect
to find on a television -- like volume controls and pause and play
buttons -- the QuickTime Player gives you enhanced controls for
online <a name="INDEX-559" />movie
playback. The QuickTime Player's LCD section includes a time
display, a time slider that shows you the length of the file being
played, and a chapter marker. You can switch chapters on the fly even
at the beginning of a video stream.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-2.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.4. Flash and Director Shockwave</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-560" />
<a name="INDEX-561" />
<a name="INDEX-562" />Macromedia Flash is
the solution for full-scale, high-impact web multimedia with short
sound effects and loops. Flash's bandwidth- friendly
<a name="INDEX-563" />vector
animation is ideally suited for web content delivery. Flash encodes
embedded soundtracks in
<a name="INDEX-564" />MP3
format that allows for better streaming and higher quality audio
playback.
</p>

<p>Flash is also tightly integrated with RealMedia. You can combine a
Flash animation with a RealAudio soundtrack using the RealDeveloper
tools to encode a RealFlash presentation. RealFlash allows
<a name="INDEX-565" />linear
playback from within the RealMedia architecture taking advantage of
RealMedia's advanced
<a name="INDEX-566" />bandwidth negotiation for
streaming audio and video and Flash's streamlined vector
graphics for <a name="INDEX-567" />interactive animation.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-568" /> <a name="INDEX-569" /> <a name="INDEX-570" />Director Shockwave is the format of
choice for building complex "CD-ROM-like" interactive web
presentations and games that utilize Macromedia's powerful
Lingo scripting language. Originally designed for full-scale
development of interactive CD-ROM content, Director has been retooled
to export highly advanced interactive Shockwave presentations for the
Web.
</p>

<p>Although Macromedia continues to integrate Flash's vector
technology into Director and some of Director's advanced
programming features into Flash, Director still stands apart in its
support for the <a name="INDEX-571" />Lingo script. To preserve its highly
compact plug-in file sizes and ease of use, Flash does not
incorporate Lingo. Lingo is a powerful scripting language that
enables developers to create and customize much more interesting
interactive media such as complex <a name="INDEX-572" />strategy games, compelling
<a name="INDEX-573" />music videos,
and <a name="INDEX-574" />educational tools.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-2.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.5. Beatnik's Rich Music Format (RMF) </h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-575" /> <a name="INDEX-576" /> <a name="INDEX-577" />Beatnik's Rich Music Format (RMF)
<a name="INDEX-578" />is an HTML-based
format that utilizes common scripting languages such as
<a name="INDEX-579" />JavaScript to
sync sophisticated interactive soundtracks that combine MIDI sounds
and short audio samples to web content. Beatnik allows you to create
full-scale, multilayered, interactive soundtracks and compositions
that transform and change with user actions. Beatnik presentations
sound excellent and download fast. And Beatnik can be incorporated
into a web page along with other technologies such as commerce
engines and backend databases.
</p>

<p>Beatnik has a few distinct advantages over technologies such as
Shockwave and Flash. For one, it uses <a name="INDEX-580" />MIDI, a
highly compact language for scoring music, to play back audio from a
dedicated synthesizer engine such as the Beatnik player. With the
same file size (15 to 30 KB) as a two-second Flash audio loop,
Beatnik can transmit a great-sounding MIDI score several minutes in
length. But Beatnik is much more than MIDI -- it also supports the
delivery and playback of short customizable digital audio samples,
making it far richer than MIDI playback alone.
</p>

<p>The downside to Beatnik is that it has a steep learning curve and
takes a considerable amount of time to debug to ensure smooth
playback. Unlike Flash, Beatnik relies on the Beatnik plug-in, as
well as a scripting language like JavaScript to control audio
playback and synchronization. Beatnik will likely become more stable
and reliable as the technology is refined and as more authoring tools
such as
<a name="INDEX-581" />Dreamweaver and
<a name="INDEX-582" />NetObjects begin
to include built-in JavaScript support.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-2.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.6. MP3 </h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-583" />
<a name="INDEX-584" />
<a name="INDEX-585" />MP3 has
gained huge popularity as an encoding format because of its great
sound quality. For radio-style broadcasts, professionals unanimously
agree that it is the best-sounding format. MP3 is most commonly used
for easily and efficiently uploading and downloading music files to
the Web. MP3 is especially popular among downloadable music
enthusiasts because it preserves audio quality while creating file
sizes that are up to 12 times smaller than uncompressed WAV or AIFF
audio files. MP3 is also quickly becoming the preferred format for
streaming music as well, even though it is more complicated than
setting up a RealMedia Server.
</p>

<p>MP3 is derived from the group known as <a name="INDEX-586" />MPEG (Moving
Pictures Experts Group). The members of MPEG are responsible for
establishing standards for digital encoding of moving pictures and
audio.
</p>

<p>Unlike Liquid Audio, MP3 is not a proprietary end-to-end music
delivery system. This distinction is important since companies
concerned about copyright protection and secure delivery may decide
to use the Liquid Music System for music distribution instead of
merely posting MP3 files on a web page. On the other hand, the fact
that MP3 is an accessible standard means it has the advantage of
widespread industry support and compatibility with many applications
and media players, including RealPlayer G2, Beatnik, Shockwave,
QuickTime 4, and Windows Media.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-2.7" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.7. Liquid Audio</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-587" />
<a name="INDEX-588" /> <a name="INDEX-589" />Liquid Audio provides a complete
end-to-end solution for
<a name="INDEX-590" />secure music delivery over the
Internet. Unlike Flash or RealAudio, Liquid Audio is less of a sound
design format for adding audio to your web site than it is a
professional utility for music sales and distribution. Accordingly,
if you want to sell digitized music files over the web, Liquid Audio
is the clear choice. You can purchase a starter package for less than
$1,000. If you just want to broadcast audio so listeners can preview
your music, you may wish to use a less expensive option such as
RealAudio or MP3.
</p>

<p>The Liquid Music System consists of four core products: Liquifier
Pro, Liquid Server, Liquid Player, and Liquid Express. Every
component of the Liquid Music System has been designed specifically
for electronic music distribution. Here is what each component lets
you do:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b><em class="emphasis">Liquifier Pro</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-591" />Liquifier Pro
is an encoder that allows you to prepare and publish CD-quality,
<a name="INDEX-592" />copy-protected music
for purchase and delivery via the Internet. The Liquifier Pro
includes DSP functions such as sample-rate conversion, four-band
parametric EQ, and dynamics processing, and it provides the
capability to include lyrics, credits, and artwork -- all in one
audio file.
</p>

<p>What distinguishes the Liquifier Pro from other encoders is its
powerful watermarking and <a name="INDEX-593" />anti-piracy protections. Liquid
Audio
<a name="INDEX-594" />watermarking
inaudibly embeds digital data, which identifies authentic copies of
the music into the audio file. Liquid Audio employs multilayer
security, which provides data on who owns the music and who bought
the music.
</p>
</dd><dt><b><em class="emphasis">Liquid Server</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-595" />Liquid Server
lets you publish and host <a name="INDEX-596" />Liquid Tracks. The Liquid Server also
includes an SQL database and can even hook into larger,
industry-standard SQL databases, such as those from
<a name="INDEX-597" />Informix and
<a name="INDEX-598" />Oracle. The flexible
design of the server allows you to send dynamic product and
p<a name="INDEX-599" />romotional information such as sale
prices, tour schedules, discounts, and coupons, along with the Liquid
Track to be received by the Liquid Player.
</p>
</dd><dt><b><em class="emphasis">Liquid Player</em> </b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-600" />Liquid Player
allows you to preview and purchase CD-quality Liquid Tracks on your
Macintosh or Windows PC. The Liquid Player is software that lets you
preview or purchase CD-quality music from the Internet. It also
allows you to see album graphics, lyrics, liner notes, and promotions
while listening, as well as easily record a standard "Red
Book" audio CD that is playable on any home, car, or portable
stereo system.
</p>
</dd><dt><b><em class="emphasis">Liquid Express</em></b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-601" />Liquid
Express is a software package specifically designed for audio
professionals in film, radio, television, music, and advertising that
allows for the secure real-time preview, approval, delivery, and
archiving of broadcast-quality audio.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Liquid Audio now also supports secure MP3 delivery through its
watermarking and file security technology. This helps ensure that
appropriate copyright and security information will adhere to
<a name="INDEX-602" />MP3
files distributed over the Internet, providing the first step to some
form of copyright standardization and unified structure to MP3
delivery.
</p>

</div>
<a name="sound-CHP-5-SECT-2.8" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.2.8. MIDI</h3>

<p>Although MIDI is not a <a name="INDEX-603" />
<a name="INDEX-604" />streaming
format, it downloads so quickly and is so widely used that we decided
to include it in this list. If you are looking for an easy, low-cost
solution for adding a little theme music or a button rollover sound
to your web site, but you don't want the long waits associated
with downloading digitized audio clips, MIDI may be a great option.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-605" />MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital
Interface) is a super-compact musical language that transmits
instructions such as pitch, volume, and note duration to
MIDI-compatible sound cards and synthesizers. Since MIDI is a
text-based musical scoring language, it downloads super-fast and is
ideally suited for HTTP delivery.
</p>

<p>The downside is that MIDI is not sound itself; rather, it is the
coded representation or score of how the sound should be reproduced
by the user's MIDI sound engine. Many browsers and computer
systems feature different MIDI sound engines that greatly vary in
quality and instrument playback style. This variation makes it
difficult for developers to predict what an end user is going to
hear.
