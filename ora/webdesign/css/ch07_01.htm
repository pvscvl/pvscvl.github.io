<p>Most web designers are familiar with the limitations of HTML as a
page layout language, even if they're not quite aware of it.
Think about your page designs for a moment. How many of them depend
on
<a name="INDEX-733" />tables
to get everything where it's supposed to go? If you're
like the vast majority of web designers, all of your pages use
tables. This is because tables can be used to create sidebars, of
course, and to set up a complicated structure for an entire
page's appearance, but also to do simpler things, like put text
in a colored box with a border.
</p>

<p>On the face of it, though, this latter effect is a little simple to
be requiring a table. If all that's needed is a paragraph that
has a red border and a yellow background, why should you have to wrap
a single-cell table around the paragraph just to get that effect?
Wouldn't it be much easier to simply say that the paragraph
itself should have the border and background, and forget about all
that table markup?
</p>

<p>Thankfully, the authors of CSS felt the same way, so they devoted a
great deal of attention to including the ability to define borders
for darned near everything a web page can contain. Paragraphs,
headings, <tt class="literal">DIV</tt>s, anchors, images, and more can be
assigned borders of various types. These borders can be used to set
an element apart from others, or accentuate its appearance, or to
mark certain kinds of data as having been changed, or to do any
number of other things.
</p>

<p>In addition to borders, it's also possible to define regions
around an element that control how the border is placed in relation
to the content and how close other elements can get. Between the
content of an element and its border, we find the
<em class="filename">padding</em><a name="INDEX-734" />
of an element, and beyond the border, the
<em class="filename">margins</em><a name="INDEX-735" />.
These properties affect how the entire document is laid out, of
course, but more importantly, they very deeply affect the appearance
of a given element. This is the foundation of much of the formatting
model of CSS, and in order to understand it, we need to examine how
an element is constructed.
</p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="css-CHP-7-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">7.1. Basic Element Boxes</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-736" />Thanks to CSS, all document elements
generate a rectangular box. This is called the <em class="filename">element
box</em>. This box describes the amount of space that an
element and its properties occupy in the layout of the document, and
each box can therefore influence the position and size of other
element boxes. For example, if the first element box in the document
is an inch tall, then the next box will begin an inch below the top
of the document. If the first element box is somehow altered in such
a way as to make it be two inches tall, then every following element
box will be shifted downward two inches, and the second element box
will begin two inches below the top of the document.
</p>

<p>As we can infer from <a href="ch07_01.htm">Figure 7-1</a>, the entirety of an
HTML document is composed of a number of rectangular boxes that are
distributed such that they don't overlap each other. Also,
within certain constraints, these boxes take up as little space as
possible, while still maintaining a sufficient separation to make
clear which content belongs to which element.
</p>

<p>For the first time, however, it is possible for authors to influence
the separation between text elements in a fundamental way -- even
to the point of causing elements to overlap each other! The margins
and padding of the element boxes are the keys to this new power.
</p>

<p>In order to fully understand how margins, padding, and borders are
handled, you must clearly understand a number of boundaries and
areas. They are shown in detail in <a href="ch07_01.htm">Figure 7-2</a>.
</p>

<p>In general, the <tt class="literal">width</tt><a name="INDEX-737" />
<a name="INDEX-738" />
of an element is defined to be the distance from the left inner edge
to the right inner edge, and the <tt class="literal">height</tt> is the
distance from the inner top to the inner bottom. Not coincidentally,
these are both properties that can be applied to an element.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-7-SIDEBAR-1" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">width</h4>

<dt><b>Values</b></dt>

<p>The counterpart to <tt class="literal">width</tt> is
<tt class="literal">height</tt>.

<p>In the course of this chapter, we will make two assumptions about
<tt class="literal">width</tt> and
<tt class="literal">height</tt><a name="INDEX-739" />. The first is that the height of an
element is always calculated automatically. If an element is eight
lines long, and each line is an eighth of an inch tall, then the
height of the element is one inch. If it's 10 lines tall, then
the height is 1.25 inches; in either case, the height is determined
by the content of the element, not the author. In the next chapter,
we'll see that this need not be so, but for this chapter, we
assume that height is only determined by the way an element is
displayed.
</p>

<p>The second assumption is that the width of an element is just as wide
as it needs to be. Under CSS, all element boxes are as wide as the
content area of their parent element. Thus, if the content area of a
<tt class="literal">DIV</tt> is two inches wide, then the overall element
box of any paragraph within that <tt class="literal">DIV</tt> will be two
inches wide as well. <a href="ch07_01.htm">Figure 7-3</a> shows this in more
detail.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-7-FIG-3" /><div class="figure"><img height="267" alt="Figure 7-3" src="figs/css.0703.gif" width="261" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 7-3. Element widths depend on the width of the parent element</h4>

<p>Under many circumstances, the width of the margins, padding, and
border of an element will all total zero, so the width of the element
equals the content area of its parent. If there are margins or
padding, for example, these are added to the element's width in
order to equal the width of the parent element's content area.
In any case, in this chapter, we always assume that the width of the
element is as wide as it needs to be to equal its parent's
content width.<a name="INDEX-740" />
