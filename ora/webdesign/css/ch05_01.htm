<p><a name="INDEX-496" />As the
authors of the specification clearly recognized, font selection will
be a popular feature of CSS. After all, how many pages are littered
with dozens, or even hundreds, of
<tt class="literal">&lt;FONT</tt><a name="INDEX-497" /> <tt class="literal">face="..."&gt;</tt>
tags? In fact, the beginning of the "Font Properties"
section of CSS1 begins with the sentence, "Setting font
properties will be among the most common uses of style sheets."
</p>

<p>The truth is that, for now, there isn't a way to ensure
consistent font use on the Web, because there isn't a uniform
way of describing fonts and variants of fonts. For example, the fonts
Times, Times New Roman, and TimesNR may be similar or the same, but
how would a user agent know that? An author might specify TimesNR in
a document, but what happens when a user without that particular font
installed views the document? Even if Times New Roman is installed,
the user agent cannot know that the two are effectively
interchangeable. And if you're hoping to force a certain font
on a reader, forget it. Although CSS2 has facilities for downloadable
fonts, these are not well implemented, and a reader could always
refuse to download fonts for performance reasons. CSS does
<em class="emphasis">not</em> provide ultimate control over fonts, any
more than does a word processor: when a Microsoft Office document you
have created is loaded on someone else's machine, its display
will depend on that person's installed fonts. If they
don't have the same fonts you do, then the document will look
different. The same is true of documents designed using CSS.
</p>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-498" />font naming problem extends much
further than trying to match font names and becomes especially
confusing in the realm of font variants, such as bold or italic text.
Most people know what italic text looks like, but how is it different
from slanted text? Yes, there are differences, but most people would
be hard put to describe them. These are not the only terms used to
refer to such text, of course; there are also the terms
<em class="filename">oblique</em>, <em class="filename">incline</em> (or
<em class="filename">inclined</em> ), <em class="filename">cursive</em>, and
<em class="filename">kursiv</em><a name="INDEX-499" />,
among others. Thus, one font may have a variant called something like
<em class="filename">Times Italic</em>, whereas another uses something
like <em class="filename">Garamond Oblique</em>. Although the two may be
effectively equivalent as the "italic form" of each font,
they are labeled quite differently. Similarly, the font variant terms
<em class="filename">Bold</em>, <em class="filename">Black</em>, and
<em class="filename">Heavy</em> may or may not mean the same thing.
</p>

<p>CSS1 attempts to provide some resolution mechanisms for all these
questions, although it cannot provide a complete solution. The most
complicated parts of font handling in
<a name="INDEX-500" />CSS1 are font family matching and font
weight matching, with font size calculations running a close third.
The font aspects addressed by CSS1 are font styles, such as italic,
and font variants such as small caps; these are much more
straightforward, relatively speaking. These features are all brought
together in a single property, <tt class="literal">font</tt>, which
we'll discuss at the end of this section. First, let's
discuss font families, since they're the most basic step in
choosing the right font for your document.
</p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="css-CHP-5-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">5.1. Font Families</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-501" /> <a name="INDEX-502" />Although there are, as was discussed
earlier, a number of ways to label what is effectively the same font,
CSS1 makes a valiant attempt to help user agents sort out the mess.
After all, what we think of as a "font" may be composed
of a large number of variations to describe boldfacing, italic text,
and so forth. As an example, you're probably familiar with the
font Times. However, Times is actually a combination of many
variants, including TimesRegular, TimesBold, TimesItalic,
TimesOblique, TimesBoldItalic, TimesBoldOblique, and so on. Each of
these variants of Times is an actual <em class="filename">font
face</em><a name="INDEX-503" />,
but Times, as we usually think of it, is a combination of all these
variant faces. In other words, Times is actually a <em class="filename">font
family</em>, not just a single font, even though most of us
think about fonts as being single entities.
</p>

<p>In addition to each specific font family such as Times, Verdana,
Helvetica, or Arial, CSS defines five generic
<a name="INDEX-504" />
<a name="INDEX-505" />font
families:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Serif fonts</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-506" />Fonts that are
proportional and have serifs. A font is proportional if all
characters in the font have a different widths due to their various
sizes. Thus, a lowercase <em class="emphasis">i</em> and a lowercase
<em class="emphasis">m</em> are of different widths. (This book's
default font is proportional, for example.) Serifs are the
decorations on the ends of strokes within each character, such as
little lines at the top and bottom of a lowercase
<em class="emphasis">l</em> or at the bottom of each leg of an uppercase
<em class="emphasis">A</em>. Examples of serif fonts are Times, Garamond,
and New Century Schoolbook.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Sans serif fonts</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-507" />Fonts that
are proportional but do not have serifs. Examples of sans serif fonts
are Helvetica, Geneva, Verdana, Arial, and Univers.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Monospace fonts</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-508" />Fonts that
are not proportional. These generally are used to emulate typewritten
text or the output from an old dot-matrix printer or an even older
video display terminal. In these fonts, each character is exactly the
same width as all the others, so that a lowercase
<em class="emphasis">i</em> is the same width as a lowercase
<em class="emphasis">m</em>. These fonts may or may not have serifs. If a
font has uniform character widths, it is classified as monospace,
regardless of the presence of serifs. Examples of monospace fonts are
Courier and Andale Mono.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Cursive fonts</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-509" />Fonts that
attempt to emulate human handwriting. Usually, these fonts are
composed largely of curves and have stroke decorations that exceed
those found in serif fonts. For example, an uppercase
<em class="emphasis">A</em> might have a small curl at the bottom of its
left leg. Examples of cursive fonts are Zapf Chancery, Author, and
Comic Sans.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Fantasy fonts</b></dt>
<dd>
<p><a name="INDEX-510" />Fonts
that are not really defined by any single characteristic other than
their inability to be easily classified in one of the other families.
A few such fonts are Western and Klingon.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>In theory, every font family a user could install will fall into one
of these generic families. In practice, this may not be the case, but
the exceptions (if any) are likely to be few and far between.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-5-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.1.1. Using Generic Font Families</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-511" />Any of these families can be employed
in a document by using the property <tt class="literal">font-family</tt>.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-5-SIDEBAR-1" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">font-family</h4>

<p>If you wish for a document to use a sans serif font, but you do not
particularly care which, then the appropriate declaration would be
this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {font-family: sans-serif;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will cause the user agent to pick a sans serif font family such
as Helvetica and apply it to the <tt class="literal">BODY</tt> element.
Thanks to inheritance, this will apply that font choice to the entire
document (unless a more specific selector overrides it, of course).
The result is something like what's shown in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Figure 5-1</a>.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-5-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="250" alt="Figure 5-1" src="figs/css.0501.gif" width="345" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-1. Using a sans serif font</h4>

<p>Using nothing more than these generic families, an author can create
a fairly sophisticated style sheet. Take the following rule set,
which is illustrated in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Figure 5-2</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {font-family: serif;}
H1, H2, H3, H4 {font-family: sans-serif;}
CODE, PRE, TT, SPAN.input {font-family: monospace;}
P.signature {font-family: cursive;}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-5-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img height="250" alt="Figure 5-2" src="figs/css.0502.gif" width="382" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-2. Various font families</h4>

<p>Thus, most of the document will be in a serif font such as Times,
including all paragraphs save those that have a class of
<tt class="literal">signature</tt>, which will instead be rendered in a
cursive font such as Author. Headings 1 through 4 will be in a sans
serif font like Helvetica, while the elements
<tt class="literal">CODE</tt>, <tt class="literal">PRE</tt>,
<tt class="literal">TT</tt>, and <tt class="literal">SPAN.input</tt> will be in a
monospace font like Courier -- which, as it happens, is how the
first three of those elements are usually presented.
</p>

</div>
<a name="css-CHP-5-SECT-1.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.1.2. Specifying Actual Font Names</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-512" />An
author may, on the other hand, have more specific preferences about
which font is used in the display of an element. In a similar vein, a
user may want to create a user style sheet that defines the exact
fonts used in the display of all documents. In either case,
<tt class="literal">font-family</tt> is still the property to use.
</p>

<p>Assume for the moment that all <tt class="literal">H1</tt>s should use
Garamond as their font. The simplest rule for this would be the
following:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">H1 {font-family: Garamond;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will cause a user agent displaying the document to use Garamond
for all <tt class="literal">H1</tt>s, as shown in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Figure 5-3</a>.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-5-FIG-3" /><div class="figure"><img height="34" alt="Figure 5-3" src="figs/css.0503.gif" width="335" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-3. An H1 element using Garamond</h4>

<p>Assuming, that is, the user agent has Garamond available for use.
What if, for whatever reason, it doesn't? In that case, the
user agent will be unable to use the rule at all. It won't
ignore the rule, but if it can't find a font called
"Garamond," then it won't be able to do anything
with the rule.
</p>

<p>All is not lost, however. By combining specific
<a name="INDEX-513" /> <a name="INDEX-514" /> <a name="INDEX-515" />font names with
generic font families, documents will come out at least close to the
author's intentions. To continue the previous example, the
following markup tells a user agent to use Garamond, if it's
available, but if not, then to use another serif font:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">H1 {font-family: Garamond, serif;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>If a reader doesn't have Garamond installed but does have
Times, the user agent might use Times for <tt class="literal">H1</tt>
elements, as <a href="ch05_01.htm">Figure 5-4</a> depicts. Even though this
isn't an exact match, it's probably close enough.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-5-FIG-4" /><div class="figure"><img height="34" alt="Figure 5-4" src="figs/css.0504.gif" width="334" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-4. An H1 element using a browser-selected serif font</h4>

<p><a name="INDEX-516" /> <a name="INDEX-517" />For this reason, authors are very
strongly encouraged to always provide a generic family as part of any
<tt class="literal">font-family</tt> rule. By doing so, you let user agents
that can't provide an exact font match use their fallback
mechanisms to pick an
<a name="INDEX-518" />alternative.
</p>

<p>This is especially helpful since, in a cross-platform environment,
there is no way to know who has which fonts installed. Sure, every
Windows machine in the world may have Arial and Times New Roman
installed, but many Macintoshes do not, and the same is probably true
of Unix machines. Conversely, while Chicago and Charcoal are common
to all recent Macintoshes, it's unlikely that Windows and Unix
users will have either font installed, and even less likely that
they'll have both. Therefore, declarations involving these
fonts, and any others, should always end with a generic font family:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">H1 {font-family: Arial, sans-serif;}
H2 {font-family: Charcoal, sans-serif;}
P {font-family: TimesNR, serif;}
ADDRESS {font-family: Chicago, sans-serif;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Again, this isn't required, but it is a very good idea.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with fonts, you might have a number of
similar fonts in mind for use in displaying a given element.
Let's say that you want all paragraphs in a document to be
displayed using Times, but you would also accept TimesNR, Garamond,
New Century Schoolbook, and New York (all of which are serif fonts).
First, decide the order of preference for these fonts, and then
string them together with commas like this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P {font-family: Times, TimesNR, 'New Century Schoolbook', Garamond, 
      'New York', serif;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Based on this list, a user agent will look for the fonts in the order
they're listed. If none of the listed fonts are available, then
it will simply pick a serif font that is available.
</p>

</div>
<a name="css-CHP-5-SECT-1.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.1.3. Using Quotation Marks</h3>

<p>You may have noticed the presence of <a name="INDEX-519" /> <a name="INDEX-520" /> <a name="INDEX-521" />single
quotation marks in the previous example, which we haven't seen
before. Quotation marks are needed in a
<tt class="literal">font-family</tt><a name="INDEX-522" /> <a name="INDEX-523" /> declaration only if
a font name has one or more spaces in it, such as "New
York," or if the font name includes symbols such as # or $. In
both cases, the entire font name needs to be enclosed in quotation
marks to keep the user agent from getting confused about what the
name really is. (You might think the commas would suffice for this,
but no.) Thus, a font called Karrank% would need to be quoted:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">H2 {Wedgie, 'Karrank%', Klingon, fantasy;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you leave off the quotation marks, the odds are high that user
agents will ignore that particular font name altogether, although
they'll still process the rest of the rule. Font names that use
a single word, like Garamond, need not be quoted, and generic family
names ("serif," "monospace," and the like)
should <em class="emphasis">never</em> be quoted. If you quote a generic
name, then the user agent will assume you are asking for a specific
font with that name (for example, "serif "), not a
generic family.
</p>

<p>As for which quotation marks to use, both single and
<a name="INDEX-524" /> <a name="INDEX-525" />double quotation marks are
acceptable. However, if you place a <tt class="literal">font-family</tt>
rule in a <tt class="literal">STYLE</tt><a name="INDEX-526" /> <a name="INDEX-527" />
<a name="INDEX-528" />attribute, you'll need to use
whichever quotes you didn't use for the attribute itself. Thus,
if you use double quotation marks to enclose the font-family rule,
then within the rule you'll have to use single quotes. If you
used double quotes in such a circumstance, they would interfere with
the attribute syntax, as you can see from <a href="ch05_01.htm">Figure 5-5</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P {font-family: sans-serif;}  /* sets paragraphs to sans-serif by default */

&lt;!-- the next example is correct (uses single-quotes) --&gt;
&lt;P STYLE="font-family: 'New Century Schoolbook', Times, serif;"&gt;...&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;!-- the next example is NOT correct (uses double-quotes) --&gt;
&lt;P STYLE="font-family: "New Century Schoolbook", Times, serif;"&gt;...&lt;/P&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-5-SECT-1.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.1.4. Good Practices</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-529" />Returning to the subject of
providing alternate fonts: generally, such lists are comprised of
<a name="INDEX-530" />
fonts from the same generic family, but this need not be the case.
Instead of listing all serif fonts or all sans serif fonts or all
cursive fonts, you can mix them up as much as you like. The only
restriction is that you can provide only a single generic family at
the end of the <tt class="literal">font-family</tt> declaration:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P.signature {Author99, ScriptTM, serif;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Here, the author has said that if neither Author99 nor ScriptTM are
available for use, then the user agent should use any serif font. Why
not specify <tt class="literal">cursive</tt> for the generic font family?
Let's extend the example a little further:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P {font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;}
P.signature {font-family: Author99, ScriptTM, cursive;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Assume that these styles are applied to a document and that the
document is viewed by someone who has neither of the two listed
"signature" fonts available and who further has no
cursive fonts available. In such a circumstance, the entire rule must
be ignored by the user agent, and the element
<tt class="literal">&lt;P</tt> <tt class="literal">CLASS="signature"&gt;</tt>
will be displayed in Verdana, or another sans serif font if Verdana
is not available, as shown in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Figure 5-6</a>.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-5-FIG-6" /><div class="figure"><img height="113" alt="Figure 5-6" src="figs/css.0506.gif" width="460" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-6. The result of having no cursive fonts installed</h4>

<p>This happens because the element is a paragraph, and since its rule
cannot be used, the more generic rule <tt class="literal">P</tt>
<tt class="literal">{font-family:</tt> <tt class="literal">Verdana,</tt>
<tt class="literal">sans-serif;}</tt> applies. In order to avoid this, a
better set of rules would be as follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P {font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;}
P.signature {font-family: Author99, ScriptTM, serif;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This way, the "signature" paragraph is more likely to be
in a font different than the rest of the document, as shown in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Figure 5-7</a>.
<a name="INDEX-531" />

<p>All of this fun font-matching stuff crops up again in another realm:
selecting the weight of a given font.
