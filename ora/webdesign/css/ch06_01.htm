<p><a name="INDEX-618" />Many
<a name="INDEX-619" />of
you will no doubt remember the first time you changed the colors of a
web page. Instead of the old black text on a gray background with
blue links, all of a sudden you could use any combination of colors
you desired -- perhaps light blue text on a black background with
lime green hyperlinks. From there, you probably moved on to putting
images in the background and combining background images with
appropriately colored text to make some really cool-looking pages.
</p>

<p>Eventually, though, one comes to realize that setting a single color
for all of the text in a page just isn't enough. That's
how
<tt class="literal">&lt;FONT</tt><a name="INDEX-620" />
<tt class="literal">COLOR="..."&gt;</tt> came into being. Without it, you
wouldn't be able to have pages where some text is black, some
red, and some white, for example.
</p>

<p>Now, thanks to the power of CSS, you can have many, many different
colors within a single page, and without using a single
<tt class="literal">FONT</tt> tag. This gives authors the ability to set up
pages where the main text is black with a white background, but the
navigational hyperlinks along the side of the page are black on a
light purple background. There are almost infinite possibilities:
defining red text for warnings, using a dark purple to make boldfaced
text even more obvious, setting each heading to be a different shade
of green, and on and on.
</p>

<p>Of course, this means that when you're designing a page, you
need to put some thought into it first. That's generally true
in any case, but with colors, it's even more so. For example,
if you're going to set all hyperlinks to be yellow, will that
clash with the background color in any part of your document? If you
use too many colors, will the user be too overwhelmed? If you change
the default hyperlink colors, will users still be able to figure out
where your links are? If you set both regular text and hyperlink text
to be the same color, for instance, then it will be much harder to
spot links -- in fact, almost impossible if the user's links
aren't underlined.
</p>

<p>Despite all these issues, the ability to change the colors of
elements is something almost every author will want to use, probably
quite often. Used properly, colors can really strengthen the
presentation of a document. Once you've decided how you plan to
use color, you have to decide how you'll apply it, since some
approaches will require the use of classes as well as simple element
selectors.
</p>

<p>As an example, let's say you have a design where all
<tt class="literal">H1</tt> elements should be green, most
<tt class="literal">H2</tt> elements should be blue, and all hyperlinks
should be dark red. However, in some cases <tt class="literal">H2</tt>
elements should be dark blue because they're associated with
different types of information. The simplest way to handle this is to
put a class of <tt class="literal">dkblue</tt> on each
<tt class="literal">H2</tt> that needs to be dark blue and declare the
following:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">H1 {color: green;}
H2 {color: blue;}
H2.dkblue {color: navy;}
A:link {color: maroon;}   /* a good dark red color */</pre></blockquote>

<p>Any <tt class="literal">H2</tt> which should be dark blue would then be
marked up as <tt class="literal">&lt;H2</tt>
<tt class="literal">CLASS="dkblue"&gt;...&lt;/H2&gt;</tt>.
</p>

<a name="ch06-1-fm2xml" /><blockquote><h4>TIP</h4>
<p><a name="INDEX-621" />It's actually better to pick class
names that are descriptive of the type of information contained
within, not of the visual effect you're trying to achieve at
the moment. For example, let's say that we want the dark blue
color to be applied to all <tt class="literal">H2</tt> elements that are
subsection headings. It would be much better to pick a class name
like <tt class="literal">subsec</tt> or even
<tt class="literal">sub-section</tt>. Both of these names have the
advantage of actually meaning something  -- and, furthermore, of
being independent of any presentational concepts. After all, you
might decide later to make all subsection titles dark red instead of
dark blue, and the statement <tt class="literal">H2.dkblue {color:</tt>
<tt class="literal">maroon;}</tt> is a little silly.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this simple example, we draw the general lesson that when
you're planning to use styles, it's generally to your
advantage to plan ahead and use all of the tools you can. To take the
preceding example a little further, suppose that a navigational bar
is added to the page. Within this bar, hyperlinks should be yellow,
not dark red. If the bar is marked with an ID of
<tt class="literal">navbar</tt>, then you need only add this rule:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#navbar A:link {color: yellow;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will change the color of hyperlinks within the navigation bar
without affecting other hyperlinks throughout the document.
</p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="css-CHP-6-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">6.1. Colors</h2>

<p>There is really only one type of color in CSS, and that's
plain, solid color. If you set the background of a page to be
<tt class="literal">red</tt>, then the entire background will be the same
shade of red. This is no different than what's been possible in
HTML up until now, of course. When you declare
<tt class="literal">&lt;BODY</tt> <tt class="literal">LINK="blue"</tt> 
<tt class="literal">VLINK="blue"&gt;</tt>, you probably expect that all
hyperlinks will be the same shade of blue, no matter where they are
in the document.
</p>

<p>Well, don't change that thinking when you're using CSS.
If you use CSS to set the color of all hyperlinks (both visited and
unvisited) to be <tt class="literal">blue</tt>, then that's what
they'll be. In the same way, if you use styles to set the
background of a page to be <tt class="literal">green</tt>, then the entire
page background will be the same shade of green throughout the entire
document. If you set the background of <tt class="literal">H1</tt> elements
to be <tt class="literal">navy</tt>, then the whole background of every
<tt class="literal">H1</tt> will be the same dark blue color.
</p>

<p>In CSS, you can set both the foreground and background colors of any
element, from the <tt class="literal">BODY</tt> down to the underline and
italics tags, and almost everything in between -- list items,
entire lists, headings, hyperlinks, table cells, form elements, and
even (in a limited fashion) images. In order to understand how this
works, though, it's important to understand what's in the
foreground of an element and what isn't.
</p>

<p>What's the foreground of an element? Generally speaking,
it's the text of an element, although that isn't the
whole story: the borders around an element are also considered to be
part of its foreground. Thus, there are two ways to directly affect
the foreground color of an element: by using the
<tt class="literal">color</tt> property and by setting the border colors
using one of a number of border properties. Primarily there is the
<tt class="literal">border-color</tt> property, as well as shorthand
properties such as <tt class="literal">border-top</tt>,
<tt class="literal">border-right</tt>, <tt class="literal">border-bottom</tt> ,
<tt class="literal">border-left</tt>, and <tt class="literal">border</tt>.
</p>

<p>The background of an element is all of the space behind the
foreground, out to the edge of the borders; thus, the content box and
the padding are all part of an element's background. There are
two ways to set the background color: the
<tt class="literal">background-color</tt> and <tt class="literal">background</tt>
properties.

<h3 class="sect2">6.1.1. Foreground Colors</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-622" /> <a name="INDEX-623" />The
easiest way to set the foreground color of an element is with the
property <tt class="literal">color</tt>.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-6-SIDEBAR-1" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>

<p>This <a name="INDEX-624" />property
accepts as a value any valid color, as discussed in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "Units and Values"</a>, such as <tt class="literal">#FFCC00</tt> or
<tt class="literal">rgb(100%,80%,0%)</tt>. It has the effect of setting the
color of the text in the element, as shown in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-1</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;P STYLE="color: gray;"&gt;This paragraph has a gray foreground.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This paragraph has the default foreground.&lt;/P&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img height="43" alt="Figure 6-1" src="figs/css.0601.gif" width="238" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-1. Declared color versus default color</h4>

<a name="ch06-4-fm2xml" /><blockquote><h4>TIP</h4>
<p>In <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-1</a>, the default foreground color is
black. That doesn't have to be the case, since users might have
set their browsers (or other user agents) to use different foreground
(text) colors. If the default text were set to green, the second
paragraph in the preceding example would be green, not
black -- but the first paragraph would still be gray.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need not restrict yourself to such simple operations, of course.
There are plenty of ways to use color. You might have some paragraphs
that contain text <a name="INDEX-625" />warning the user of a potential
problem. In order to make this text stand out more than usual, you
might decide to color it red. All that's needed is a class of
<tt class="literal">warn</tt> on each paragraph that contains warning text
(<tt class="literal">&lt;P</tt> <tt class="literal">CLASS="warn"&gt;</tt>) and
the following rule:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P.warn {color: red;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>In the same document, you decide that any
<a name="INDEX-626" />
<a name="INDEX-627" />
<a name="INDEX-628" />links
within a warning paragraph should be green. Thus:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P.warn {color: red;}
P.warn A:link {color: green;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Then you change your mind, deciding that warning text should be gray
and that links in such text should be silver. The preceding rules
need only be changed to reflect the new values:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P.warn {color: gray;}
P.warn A:link {color: silver;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Another use for color is to draw attention to certain types of text.
For example, <a name="INDEX-629" />boldfaced text is already fairly
obvious, but you could give it a different color to make it stand out
even further:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">B {color: maroon;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Then you decide that you want all <a name="INDEX-630" />table cells with a class of
<tt class="literal">highlight</tt> to contain yellow text:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">TD.highlight {color: yellow;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This sets the foreground color of all elements within any table cell
with a class of <tt class="literal">highlight</tt> to be yellow, as shown
in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-2</a>:
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-2" /><div class="figure"><img height="45" alt="Figure 6-2" src="figs/css.0602.gif" width="305" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-2. Highlighting a table cell contents</h4>

<h3 class="sect3">6.1.1.1. BODY attributes</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-631" /> <a name="INDEX-632" /> <a name="INDEX-633" />There are many uses for
<tt class="literal">color</tt>, of course, the most basic of which is to
replace the <tt class="literal">BODY</tt> attributes
<tt class="literal">TEXT</tt>, <tt class="literal">LINK</tt> ,
<tt class="literal">ALINK</tt> , and <tt class="literal">VLINK</tt>. In
conjunction with the anchor pseudo-classes, <tt class="literal">color</tt>
can replace these <tt class="literal">BODY</tt> attributes outright. The
first line in the following example can be rewritten with the
subsequent CSS, and either will have the result depicted in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-3</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;BODY TEXT="black" LINK="#808080" ALINK="silver" VLINK="#333333"&gt;

BODY {color: black;}     /* replacement CSS */
A:link {color: #808080;}
A:active {color: silver;}
A:visited {color: #333333;}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-3" /><div class="figure"><img height="57" alt="Figure 6-3" src="figs/css.0603.gif" width="391" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-3. Replacing BODY attributes with CSS</h4>

<p>While this may seem like a lot of extra typing, consider that using
the old method of <tt class="literal">BODY</tt> attributes, you could only
make changes at the document level. For example, if you wanted some
links to be medium gray and others a relatively dark gray, you
couldn't do that with the <tt class="literal">BODY</tt> attributes.
Instead, you'd have to use <tt class="literal">&lt;FONT</tt>
<tt class="literal">COLOR="#666666"&gt;</tt> on every single anchor that
needed to be relatively dark. Not so with CSS; all you need to do is
add a class to all anchors that need to be this shade of gray and
modify your styles accordingly, with the result seen in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-4</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {color: black;}
A:link {color: #808080;}      /* medium gray */
A.external:link  {color: silver;}
A:active {color: silver;}
A:visited {color: #333333;}   /* a very dark gray */</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-4" /><div class="figure"><img height="57" alt="Figure 6-4" src="figs/css.0604.gif" width="381" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-4. Changing colors of hyperlinks</h4>

<p>This sets all anchors with the class <tt class="literal">external</tt>
(<tt class="literal">&lt;A</tt> <tt class="literal">CLASS="external"</tt> 
<tt class="literal">HREF="..."&gt;</tt>) to be silver, instead of medium
gray. They'll still be a dark gray once they've been
visited, of course, unless you add a special rule for that as well:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {color: black;}
A:link {color: #808080;}      /* medium gray */
A.external:link  {color: #666666;}
A:active {color: silver;}
A:visited {color: #333333;}   /* a very dark gray */
A.external:visited {color: black;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will cause all external links to be medium gray before
they're visited and black once they've been visited,
while all other links will be dark gray when visited and medium gray
when unvisited -- as <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-5</a> makes clear.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-5" /><div class="figure"><img height="57" alt="Figure 6-5" src="figs/css.0605.gif" width="381" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-5. Setting different colors for different hyperlink classes</h4>

<p>This sort of thing simply isn't possible with the old
<tt class="literal">BODY</tt> attributes. Furthermore, if you're
going to use the <tt class="literal">BODY</tt> attributes, you have to
define them in each and every document. If you ever decide to change
those values ...well, you have a lot of files to edit, don't
you? On the other hand, if you set up these colors as an external
style sheet, and then link all of your pages to the style sheet, then
you only have to edit one file in order to change the text colors of
every last one of your pages.<a name="INDEX-634" /> <a name="INDEX-635" /> <a name="INDEX-636" />

<a name="css-CHP-6-SECT-1.1.2" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.1.1.2. Affecting borders</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-637" />The
value of <tt class="literal">color</tt> can also affect the borders around
an element. Let's assume that you've declared these
styles, which have the result shown in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-6</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P.aside {color: gray; border-style: solid;}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-6" /><div class="figure"><img height="167" alt="Figure 6-6" src="figs/css.0606.gif" width="386" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-6. Border colors are taken from the content's color</h4>

<p>This will result in the element <tt class="literal">&lt;P</tt>
<tt class="literal">CLASS="aside"&gt;</tt> having gray text and a gray
medium-width solid border. That's because the foreground color
is applied to the borders by default. The basic way to override that
is with the property
<tt class="literal">border-color</tt><a name="INDEX-638" />:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P.aside {color: gray; border-style: solid; border-color: black;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will make the text <tt class="literal">gray</tt>, but the borders will
be <tt class="literal">black</tt> in color, as we can see from <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-7</a>. Any value set for
<tt class="literal">border-color</tt> will always override the value of
<tt class="literal">color</tt><a name="INDEX-639" />.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-7" /><div class="figure"><img height="167" alt="Figure 6-7" src="figs/css.0607.gif" width="384" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-7. Overriding the default border color </h4>

<p>It's in the borders, incidentally, where you can have an effect
on the foreground color of images. Since images are already composed
of colors, you can't really affect them using
<tt class="literal">color</tt>, but you can change the color of any border
that appears around the
<a name="INDEX-640" />image. This can be done using either
<tt class="literal">color</tt> or <tt class="literal">border-color</tt>.
Therefore, the following rules will have the same visual effect on
images of class <tt class="literal">type1</tt> <em class="emphasis">and</em>
<tt class="literal">type2</tt>, as shown in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-8</a>:

<a name="css-CHP-6-SECT-1.1.3" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.1.1.3. Inheriting color</h3>

<p>By this time, you may have guessed that
<tt class="literal">color</tt><a name="INDEX-641" />
<a name="INDEX-642" /> is inherited, and you're right.
This makes good sense, since if you declare <tt class="literal">P</tt>
<tt class="literal">{color:</tt> <tt class="literal">maroon;}</tt>, you probably
expect that any text within that paragraph will also be maroon, even
if it's emphasized or boldfaced or whatever. Of course, if you
<em class="emphasis">want</em> such elements to be different colors,
that's easy enough, as illustrated by <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-9</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P {color: maroon;}
EM {color: #999999;}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-9" /><div class="figure"><img height="49" alt="Figure 6-9" src="figs/css.0609.gif" width="334" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-9. Different colors for different elements</h4>

<p>Thanks to the inheritability of color, it's theoretically possible to
set all of the ordinary text in a document to be a color such as red
by declaring <tt class="literal">BODY</tt> <tt class="literal">{color:
red;}</tt>. This should cause all text which is not otherwise
styled (such as anchors, which have their own color styles) to be
red. This should not affect elements such as horizontal rules (
<tt class="literal">HR</tt> ) or images. However, early versions of
Explorer did inherit colors onto <tt class="literal">HR</tt> elements,
while they didn't allow the colors to inherit onto form elements.
This is more of a problem with inheritance than it is with color, but
unfortunately the problem is still there. In fact, even today it's
possible to find browsers that have predefined colors for things like
tables, which prevent <tt class="literal">BODY</tt> colors from inheriting
into table cells:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {color: red;}
TABLE {color: black;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>That's because the combination of your style, and the
browser's built-in styles looks like <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-10</a>.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-10" /><div class="figure"><img height="202" alt="Figure 6-10" src="figs/css.0610.gif" width="374" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-10. The result of combining author styles and browser styles</h4>

<p>Since there is a <tt class="literal">color</tt> value defined by the
browser for <tt class="literal">TABLE</tt> elements, it will take
precedence over the inherited value. This is annoying and
unnecessary, but it is an obstacle to be overcome. You can overcome
it (usually) with selectors that list various table elements. For
example, in order to get all your table content to be red along with
your document's body, try this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY, TABLE, TD, TH {color: red;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will often solve the problem. I say "often" because
it doesn't always work, for reasons that are poorly understood.
Navigator 4 has the most trouble getting it right, but its failures
are not consistent. The best minds in CSS analysis have yet to come
up with a recipe for predicting Navigator's behavior,
unfortunately.
</p>

<a name="ch06-8-fm2xml" /><blockquote><h4>WARNING</h4>
<p>Something else to watch out for is Navigator 4's handling of
values for <tt class="literal">color</tt> that it doesn't recognize.
If Navigator 4 encounters an unknown word (such as
<tt class="literal">invalidValue</tt>) somehow, through mechanisms known
only to itself, it actually arrives at and uses a color. It
doesn't do so randomly, exactly, but the effect is practically
the same. For example, <tt class="literal">invalidValue</tt> comes out as a
dark blue, and <tt class="literal">inherit</tt>, which is a valid value
under CSS2 but not CSS1, will come out as a really awful shade of
yellow-green. This is not correct behavior, but you'll need to
remember it as you write your styles.

<p>Setting a value for <tt class="literal">color</tt> should (in theory,
anyway) apply to <a name="INDEX-643" />form elements. As <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-11</a> proves, declaring <tt class="literal">SELECT</tt>

<blockquote><pre class="code">SELECT {color: rgb(33%,33%,33%);}
INPUT {color: gray;}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-12" /><div class="figure"><img height="84" alt="Figure 6-12" src="figs/css.0612.gif" width="306" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-12. Changing form element foregrounds</h4>

<p>Note in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-12</a> that the text color next to the
checkboxes is still black. This is because we've only assigned
styles to elements like <tt class="literal">INPUT</tt> and
<tt class="literal">SELECT</tt>, not normal paragraph (or other) text.
</p>

<p>One limitation under CSS1 is that there isn't a way to
distinguish between different types of <tt class="literal">INPUT</tt>
elements. If you need to have checkboxes be a different color than
radio buttons, then you'll need to assign them classes so that
you get the desired result (seen in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-13</a>):
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">INPUT.radio {color: #666666;}
INPUT.check {color: #CCCCCC;}

&lt;INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="r2" VALUE="A" CLASS="radio"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="c3" VALUE="one" CLASS="check"&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>In CSS2, it's a little easier to distinguish between different
elements based on what attributes they have. As an example, the rules
shown here will match the following two <tt class="literal">INPUT</tt>
tags, respectively:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">INPUT[type="radio"] {color: #333333;}
INPUT[type="checkbox"] {color: #666666;}

&lt;INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="r2" VALUE="A "&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="c3" VALUE="one "&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>This allows you to dispense with the classes altogether, at least in
this instance. See the <a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "CSS2: A Look Ahead"</a>, for more details
on how this kind of selector works.

<p><a name="INDEX-646" />
<a name="INDEX-647" />In
a <a name="INDEX-648" />fashion very similar to setting the
foreground color, it's possible to declare a color for the
background of an element. For this, you use the property
<tt class="literal">background-color</tt>, which accepts (unsurprisingly)
any valid color.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-6-SIDEBAR-2" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">background-color</h4>

<dl>
<dt><b>Values</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>&lt;color&gt; | <tt class="literal">transparent</tt></p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Initial value</b></dt>

</dd>

</dl>

<dt><b>Applies to</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>all elements</p>
</dd>

</dl>
</td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>The background is the area of the content box and the padding and is
always behind the foreground of the element. Therefore, the declared
background color is applied to both the element's content box
and its padding, as illustrated in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-14</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P {background-color: gray;}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-14" /><div class="figure"><img height="99" alt="Figure 6-14" src="figs/css.0614.gif" width="392" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-14. Background gray for paragraphs</h4>

<p>If you wish the color to extend out a little bit from the text in the
element, then you need only add some padding to the mix, with the
result shown in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-15</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P {background-color: gray; padding: 10px;}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-15" /><div class="figure"><img height="159" alt="Figure 6-15" src="figs/css.0615.gif" width="392" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-15. Backgrounds and padding</h4>

<p>(Padding will be discussed in detail in <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "Boxes and Borders"</a>.)</p>

<p>The background color of just about any element can be set, from
<tt class="literal">BODY</tt> all the way down to inline elements such as
<tt class="literal">EM</tt> and <tt class="literal">A</tt>. Even form elements
should be affected by the property, although not all user agents can
do this correctly. Also,
<tt class="literal">background-color</tt><a name="INDEX-649" />
<a name="INDEX-650" /> is not inherited. Its default
value is
<tt class="literal">transparent</tt><a name="INDEX-651" />
<a name="INDEX-652" />,
which makes sense; if an element doesn't have a defined color,
then its background should be transparent so that the background of
its ancestor elements will be visible. Imagine for a moment that the
default value were something else, such as <tt class="literal">silver</tt>.
Then you would always see something along the lines of <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-16</a>. This could be quite a problem, if
that's how browsers behaved! Fortunately, they don't.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-16" /><div class="figure"><img height="99" alt="Figure 6-16" src="figs/css.0616.gif" width="377" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-16. Nontransparent backgrounds</h4>

<p>Most of the time, you'll have no reason to use the keyword
<tt class="literal">transparent</tt>. On occasion, though, it can be
useful. Although it's the default value, users might set their
browsers to make all links have a white background. When you design
your page, though, you set anchors to have a white foreground, and
you don't want a background on those anchors. In order to make
sure that this happens, you would declare:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">A:link {color: white; background-color: transparent;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you left out the background color, then your white foreground
would combine with the user's white background to yield totally
unreadable links.
</p>

<h3 class="sect3">6.1.2.1. Real-world issues</h3>

<p>That's pretty much all there is to setting a background color.
Well, except for one more small warning: <a name="INDEX-653" />Navigator 4 gets the placement of
background colors completely wrong. Instead of applying the
background color to the entire content box and padding, the color
only appears behind the text itself, as shown in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-17</a>.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-17" /><div class="figure"><img height="96" alt="Figure 6-17" src="figs/css.0617.gif" width="352" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-17. Navigator's incorrect behavior</h4>

<p>Let me reiterate: <em class="emphasis">this is totally wrong</em>.
However, there is a way around it, which is to set a border on the
element. You can do this by setting the border the same color as the
background color of your document:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {background: silver;}
P {background-color: gray; padding: 1px; border: 0.1px solid gray;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>It is necessary to set a <tt class="literal">border-style</tt> for this
technique to work. Whether you use that specific property, or simply
a value of the <tt class="literal">border</tt> property, doesn't
really matter.
</p>

<p>Of course, by doing this, you're setting a border on the
element, and that border will show up in other user agents as well.
And, just to top things off, Navigator doesn't handle padding
very well, so the previous example would result in a small amount of
blank space between the content box and the borders. Altogether, it
isn't a very pretty picture.<a name="INDEX-654" /> <a name="INDEX-655" /> <a name="INDEX-656" />

<a name="css-CHP-6-SECT-1.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.1.3. Special Effects</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-657" />Let's return to the happier realm
of how things should work. Thanks to <tt class="literal">color</tt> and
<tt class="literal">background-color</tt>, you can create some nice
effects. This example is shown in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-18</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P {color: black;}
H1 {color: white; background-color: rgb(20%,20%,20%);}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-18" /><div class="figure"><img height="192" alt="Figure 6-18" src="figs/css.0618.gif" width="393" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-18. A nifty effect for H1 elements</h4>

<p>This shows but one example of how displays can be dramatically
changed with just a few styles. Of course, there are as many
combinations as there are colors, but we can't exactly show
them here -- being stuck in grayscale as we are -- however,
we'll try to give you some idea of what you can do. Here are a
few ideas to get you started.
</p>

<p>This is a simple style sheet, as shown in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-19</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {color: rgb(0%,50%,0%); background-color: #CCFFCC;}
H1, H2 {color: yellow; background-color: rgb(0,51,0);}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-19" /><div class="figure"><img height="231" alt="Figure 6-19" src="figs/css.0619.gif" width="392" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-19. The results of a simple style sheet</h4>

<p>This style sheet is more sophisticated (shown in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-20</a>):
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {color: black; background-color: white;}
P {color: #333;}
PRE, CODE, TT {color: rgb(50%,50%,50%); background-color: #FFFFCC;}
A:link {color: blue; background-color: yellow;}
A:visited {color: navy; background-color: white;}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-20" /><div class="figure"><img height="293" alt="Figure 6-20" src="figs/css.0620.gif" width="466" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-20. The results of a more sophisticated style sheet</h4>

<p>This is but the tiniest beginning of what's possible, of
course. By all means, try some examples of your own!<a name="INDEX-658" />
</p>

</div>
<a name="css-CHP-6-SECT-1.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.1.4. Good Practices</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-659" />
<a name="INDEX-660" />
<a name="INDEX-661" />
<a name="INDEX-662" />You
may have noticed that in almost every circumstance, where we set a
foreground color, we also set a background color. In general, this is
a good idea. Since you don't know what styles a user may have
predefined, you don't know how your styles might interact with
them. Remember the example where links ended up being white on white?
That's the sort of thing we want to avoid.
</p>

<p>Let's explore this in a little more detail. Assume the
following:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">/* reader styles */
BODY {color: white; background-color: black;}

/* author styles */
BODY {color: black;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Since, in this circumstance, the author's styles will outweigh
the reader's styles -- that's how it is under CSS1,
anyway -- then the new style sheet for this document will be as
follows (shown in <a href="ch06_01.htm">Figure 6-21</a>):
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">/* combined styles */
BODY {color: black; background-color: black;}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-6-FIG-21" /><div class="figure"><img height="93" alt="Figure 6-21" src="figs/css.0621.gif" width="399" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 6-21. Black on black</h4>

<p>Not exactly readable, is it? Only the hyperlinks are visible, thanks
to their default styles. That's why it's always a good
idea to combine foreground and background colors in the same
declaration. If it's important enough that you declare one,
then it's definitely important enough to declare<a name="INDEX-663" /> both.<a name="INDEX-664" />
