<h2 class="sect1">2.6. Inheritance</h2>

<p>Viewing a document as a tree is very important for one other reason:
a key feature of CSS is
<em class="filename">inheritance</em><a name="INDEX-248" />,
which relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate.
<em class="filename">Inheritance</em> is simply the mechanism by which
styles are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its
descendants. If a color is applied to an <tt class="literal">H1</tt>
element, for example, then that color is applied to all text in the
<tt class="literal">H1</tt>, even the text enclosed within child elements
of that <tt class="literal">H1</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">H1 {color: gray;}

&lt;H1&gt;Meerkat &lt;EM&gt;Central&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>As shown in <a href="ch02_06.htm">Figure 2-23</a>, both the ordinary
<tt class="literal">H1</tt> text and the <tt class="literal">EM</tt> text are
colored <tt class="literal">gray</tt> because the value of
<tt class="literal">color</tt> inherits into the <tt class="literal">EM</tt>
element. This is very likely what the author intended, which is why
inheritance is a part of CSS.
</p>

<p>The alternative would be a hypothetical situation where inheritance
does not operate; in that case, the <tt class="literal">EM</tt> text would
be black, not gray.
</p>

<p>Another good example of how inheritance works is with unordered
lists. Let's say we apply a style of <tt class="literal">color:</tt>
<tt class="literal">gray</tt> for <tt class="literal">UL</tt> elements. What we
expect is that a style that is applied to a <tt class="literal">UL</tt>
will be applied to its list items as well, and to any content of
those list items. Thanks to inheritance, that's exactly what
does happen, as <a href="ch02_06.htm">Figure 2-24</a> demonstrates:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">UL {color: gray;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Inheritance is one of those things about CSS that are so basic that
you almost never think about them unless you have to -- rather
like the way we tend to take the convenience of the highway system
for granted until part of it is closed or otherwise rendered
difficult to use. However, there are a few things to keep in mind
about inheritance.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-2-SECT-6.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">2.6.1. Limitations of Inheritance</h3>

<p>As with any great thing, there are a few blemishes if you look
closely enough. First off, some properties are not inherited. This
may be for any number of reasons, but they generally have to do with
simple common sense. For example, the property
<tt class="literal">border</tt> (which is used to set borders on elements,
oddly enough) does not inherit. A quick glance at <a href="ch02_06.htm">Figure 2-25</a> will reveal why this is the case. Were borders
inherited, documents would become much more "cluttered"
unless the author took the extra effort to turn off the inherited
borders.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-2-FIG-25" /><div class="figure"><img height="185" alt="Figure 2-25" src="figs/css.0225.gif" width="316" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 2-25. Why borders aren't inherited</h4>

<p>As it happens, most of the box-model properties, including margins,
padding, backgrounds, and borders, are not inherited for this very
reason.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-2-SIDEBAR-1" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Inherit the Bugs</h4>

<p><a name="INDEX-249" />Inheritance can be a tricky thing,
unfortunately. Thanks to problems in various browser implementations,
an author cannot always rely on inheritance to operate as expected in
all circumstances. For example, Navigator 4 (and, to a lesser extent,
Explorer 4) does not inherit styles into tables. Thus the following
rule would result in a document with purple text everywhere outside
of tables:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {color: purple;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Even that isn't quite true, as some versions of Navigator 4
will forget about styles altogether once a table has been displayed;
thus, any text after a table, as well as the text within it, would
not be purple. This is not technically correct behavior, but it does
exist, so authors often resort to tricks such as:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY, TABLE, TH, TD {color: purple;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This is more likely, although still not certain, to achieve the
desired effect. Despite this potential problem, the rest of this text
will treat inheritance as though it operated perfectly in all cases,
since an exhaustive documentation of the ways and reasons it might
fail could be a book in itself.
