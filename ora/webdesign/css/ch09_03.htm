<h2 class="sect1">9.3. Absolute Positioning</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-1087" /> <a name="INDEX-1088" />Since
most of the examples and figures in the chapter (besides the previous
section) have been examples of absolute positioning, we're
already halfway to an understanding of how it works. Most of what
remain are the details of what happens when absolute positioning is
invoked.
</p>

<p>When an element is positioned absolutely, it is completely removed
from the document flow. It is then positioned with respect to its
containing block, and its edges are placed using the side-offset
properties. The positioned element does not flow around the content
of other elements, nor does their content flow around the positioned
element. This implies that an absolutely positioned element may
overlap other elements, or be overlapped by them. (We'll see
how you can affect the overlapping order at the end of the chapter.)
</p>

<p>Remember that the containing block of an absolutely positioned
element is not necessarily its parent element. In fact, it often is
not, unless the author takes steps to correct this situation.
Fortunately, that's easy to do. Just pick the element that you
want to use as the containing block for the absolutely positioned
element, and give it a <tt class="literal">position</tt> of
<tt class="literal">relative</tt> with no offsets. Thus:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P.contain {position: relative;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Consider the example in <a href="ch09_03.htm">Figure 9-19</a>. It shows two
paragraphs that contain identical text. However, the first paragraph
contains an inline boldface element, and the second an absolutely
positioned boldface element. In the second paragraph, the styles used
would be something like what is shown here:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">P {position: relative;}   /* establish containing blocks */

&lt;B STYLE="position: absolute; top: auto; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: auto;
 width: 8em; height: 4em;"&gt;...&lt;/B&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-9-FIG-19" /><div class="figure"><img height="248" alt="Figure 9-19" src="figs/css.0919.gif" width="298" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-19. The effects of absolute positioning</h4>

<p>For the most part, the text in both paragraphs looks fairly normal.
In the second one, however, the place where the boldface element
would have appeared is simply closed up, and the positioned text
overlaps the some of the content. There is no way to avoid this,
short of positioning the boldfaced text outside of the paragraph (by
using a negative value for <tt class="literal">right</tt>) or by specifying
a padding for the paragraph that is wide enough to accommodate the
positioned element. Also, since it has a transparent background, the
parent element's text shows through the positioned element. The
only way to avoid this is to set a background for the positioned
element.
</p>

<p>Note that the boldface element in this case is positioned in relation
to its parent element's content box, which defines its
containing block. Without the relative positioning of the parent
element, the containing block would be another element. Consider a
case where the element being positioned is a child of the
<tt class="literal">BODY</tt> element, e.g., a paragraph or heading
element. With the right styles, the containing block for the
positioned element will be the entire <tt class="literal">BODY</tt>
element. Thus, applying the following styles to the
<tt class="literal">BODY</tt> and the fifth paragraph in a document would
lead to a situation similar to that shown in <a href="ch09_03.htm">Figure 9-20</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {position: relative;}

&lt;P STYLE="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 25%; left: 25%; bottom: auto; 
 width: 50%; height: auto; background: silver;"&gt;...&lt;/P&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-9-FIG-20" /><div class="figure"><img height="291" alt="Figure 9-20" src="figs/css.0920.gif" width="318" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-20. An absolutely positioned paragraph</h4>

<p>The paragraph is now positioned at the very beginning of the
document, half as wide as the document's width and overwriting
the first few elements!
</p>

<p>In addition, if the document is scrolled, the paragraph will scroll
right along with it. This is because the element's containing
block is the <tt class="literal">BODY</tt> element's content area,
not the viewport. If you want to position elements so that
they're placed relative to the viewport and don't scroll
along with the rest of the document, then the next section is for
you.
</p>

<p>Before we get there, however, there are a few more things to cover.
Remember that absolutely positioned boxes can have backgrounds,
margins, borders, and padding; styles can be applied within them,
just as with any other element. This can make them very useful for
the creation of sidebars, <a name="INDEX-1089" />"sticky
notes," and other such effects. One example is the ability to
set a "<a name="INDEX-1090" />change marker" on any paragraph
that has been edited. This could be done using the following styles
and markup:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">SPAN.change {position: absolute; top: 0; left: -5em; width: 4em; 
  font-weight: bold;}
P {margin-left: 5em; position: relative;}

&lt;P&gt; Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, 
sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut &lt;SPAN CLASS="change"&gt;***&lt;/SPAN&gt;
laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.&lt;/P&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>While this does rely on inserting an extra element, the advantage is
that the <tt class="literal">SPAN</tt> can be placed anywhere in the
paragraph and still have the result depicted in <a href="ch09_03.htm">Figure 9-21</a>.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-9-FIG-21" /><div class="figure"><img height="96" alt="Figure 9-21" src="figs/css.0921.gif" width="400" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-21. Setting a "change bar" with absolute positioning</h4>

<p>However, maybe we'd like to place the change marker next to
whatever line was changed. In that case, we need to make only one
small alteration to our styles, and we'll get the result shown
in <a href="ch09_03.htm">Figure 9-22</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">SPAN.change {position: absolute; top: static-position; left: -5em; width: 4em; 
  font-weight: bold;}
P {margin-left: 5em; position: relative;}

&lt;P&gt; Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, 
sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut &lt;SPAN CLASS="change"&gt;***&lt;/SPAN&gt;
laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.&lt;/P&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-9-FIG-22" /><div class="figure"><img height="96" alt="Figure 9-22" src="figs/css.0922.gif" width="399" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-22. Another approach to defining a "change bar"</h4>

<p>Remember when we mentioned <tt class="literal">static-position</tt> much
earlier in the chapter? Here's one example of how it works and
how it can be very useful.
</p>

<p>Another important point is that when an element is positioned, it
establishes a <a name="INDEX-1091" />containing block for its descendant
elements. For example, we could absolutely position an element and
then absolutely position one of its children, as shown in <a href="ch09_03.htm">Figure 9-23</a>.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-9-FIG-23" /><div class="figure"><img height="200" alt="Figure 9-23" src="figs/css.0923.gif" width="300" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 9-23. Nested absolutely positioned elements</h4>

<p>The small box B in the lower-left corner of the element A is a child
of A, which is in turn a child of a relatively positioned
<tt class="literal">DIV</tt>. B was absolutely positioned, as was element
A, using styles like these:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">DIV {position: relative;}
P.A {position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; width: 15em; height: auto; 
   margin-left: auto;}
P.B {position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0; width: 10em; height: 50%;
   margin-top: auto;}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This is an important point to always keep in mind: only positioned
elements establish containing blocks for their descendant elements. I
know this has come up before, but it's so fundamental that it
needs to be repeated.<a name="INDEX-1092" /> <a name="INDEX-1093" />
