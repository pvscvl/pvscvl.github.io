<h2 class="sect1">0.4. Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>This book was written with a single goal: to make Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) easy to learn, understand, and use. Of course, there is
much more to this goal than meets the eye. Trying to translate
tersely defined algorithms into comprehensible English isn't
always as easy as it sounds.
</p>

<p>In my work on this book, I found myself crawling through the various
nooks and crannies of CSS, creating test suites, and banging my head
against myriad problems, not to mention the aforementioned web
browser limitations. Along the way, I encountered a number of people
whom I'd like to thank.
</p>

<p>First, of course, are H&aring;kon Wium Lie of Opera Software and Bert
Bos of the W3C for their efforts in creating Cascading Style Sheets,
and for answering many of my questions on the 
<em>www-style</em> mailing list, even the foolish
ones. I'd also like to thank Chris Lilley, also of the W3C, for
encouraging my attempts to help make the web more stylish. His words
of praise for some of my earliest efforts came at exactly the right
moment to spur me on, and it was he who made it possible for me to
join the World Wide Web Consortium's CSS&amp;FP Working Group.
</p>

<p>Tim O'Reilly took a big chance in giving me my first shot at a
major professional publication, for which I will always be grateful.
My editor at O'Reilly, Richard Koman, was more than patient
with me during the writing process, and I probably should have shown
my gratitude by sending in more rough drafts. Tara McGoldrick, also
of O'Reilly, was a great help in sorting out figures, smoothing
out communications, and generally making my life much easier. Dale
Dougherty of Songline Studios gave me my first real break into
professional writing, and Chuck Toporek (now at O'Reilly) was
my long-suffering first editor at <em class="emphasis">Web Review</em>,
managing to weather my totally random article submission schedule
with good grace. My friend and colleague Peter Murray was gracious
enough to contribute some of his time and expertise to assist me in
the creation of one of the Case Studies, and Ron Ryan gets a gold
star and a whole bucket of "attaboys" for being the best
supervisor I've ever known.
</p>

<p>The gang from the Usenet group <em class="emphasis">comp.infosystems.www.authoring.stylesheets</em>
has been a huge help over the years, both in answering questions and
providing feedback. Within that group, Todd Fahrner, Alan Flavell,
Anthony Boyd, and Jan Roland Eriksson have been generally clueful and
helpful, and Sue Sims deserves special mention for being just as
helpful plus willing to assist (and occasionally defend) someone
she'd never met -- namely, me. Ian Hickson and David Baron
deserve thanks for not only being as expert on the subject of CSS as
anyone else I know, but also for applying their raw energy to
interpreting the specification, ferreting out browser bugs, and
generally being helpful in spreading the CSS gospel. Their comments
and insights were extraordinarily helpful in the writing of this
work.
</p>

<p>And, of course, a hearty "hikeeba!" to the CSS Samurai:
Todd Fahrner, Liam Quin, David Baron, Ian Hickson, Sue Sims, Jan
Roland Eriksson, John Alsopp, and Braden McDaniel. Yes, many of those
names are repeats. What can I say? It's a small web.
</p>

<p>Please note that none of these people should be blamed for any errors
contained herein. They should instead be credited for helping me
correct a vast number of mistakes, even if they didn't always
know they were doing so.
</p>

<p>At this point, I believe it's appropriate for me to thank Tim
Berners-Lee for inventing the World Wide Web. I don't know Tim,
and he doesn't know me, but it's pretty much required
that authors of books related to the Web thank Tim for his
fundamental contribution. I think this might actually be an
international law by now; call it the Berners Convention.
</p>

<p>And, finally, personal thanks to: Michelle, for being a friend
through thick and thin; Randy, who has always gladly been both
teacher and confidant; Steve, who helped me survive college and the
years succeeding it; Dave, for all the years of making me laugh,
especially when I most needed it, and for being the voice of sanity
when I least expected it; and Tina, who helped me to stand when I
wanted to stay down.
</p>

<p>I'd also like to thank my wonderful wife, Kathryn, for her
boundless support and for meritorious valor in putting up with me,
particularly when my deadlines loomed, and for her inexhaustible
belief in me and my abilities; and humble thanks to my parents, Art
and Carol, and my sister, Julie, all of whom have always been there
for me and never did learn to tell me when to quit. Well, guys, I
guess it's too late now.
</p>

<p>Thanks for everything.</p>
