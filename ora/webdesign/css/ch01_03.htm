<h2 class="sect1">1.3. Limitations of CSS</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-36" />There are a few areas that CSS1 does not
address, and therefore are not covered in detail in this book; some
of these topics are touched upon in <a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "CSS2: A Look Ahead"</a>. Of
course, even a full-blown CSS implementation, covering all of CSS1
and CSS2, would not meet every request from every page designer in
the world. It's worth going through some of the boundaries of
CSS.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-1-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.3.1. Limited Initial Scope</h3>

<p>When you get right down to it, CSS1 is not an overly complicated
specification. The entire thing can be printed out in less than 100
pages, and it contains about 70 properties. It is still a very
sophisticated and subtle engine, but some areas of web design were
omitted from CSS1.
</p>

<p>In the first place,
<a name="INDEX-37" />
<a name="INDEX-38" />CSS1 had almost
nothing to say about tables. You might think that you can set
<a name="INDEX-39" />margins on table cells, for
example -- and a web browser might even let you do so -- but
margins should not be applied to table cells under any circumstances.
CSS2 introduced a new set of properties and behaviors for dealing
with tables, but as of this writing, few if any of these are
supported.
</p>

<a name="ch01-9-fm2xml" /><blockquote><h4>TIP</h4>
<p>To a certain degree, the omission of tables from CSS1 says a great
deal about the feeling many have that tables should never be used to
lay out pages. It is felt that floated and positioned elements should
do all of the work tables used to do, and more. Whether this premise
can be supported is not a discussion I intend to undertake here.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a similar way, CSS1 contains nothing in the way of
<a name="INDEX-40" />positioning. Sure, it's possible
to move elements around a little bit, but mostly with negative
margins and floating. Everything is, in a sense, relative. CSS2, on
the other hand, has three chapters devoted to the
<a name="INDEX-41" />visual rendering model, which includes the
positioning of elements.
</p>

<p>CSS1 makes no provision for downloadable
<a name="INDEX-42" />fonts. This leads to a good
deal of discussion about how to account for user system
configurations and available fonts. CSS2 introduces some
font-handling, but even there the issue is not resolved, mostly due
to the lack of a widely supported font format. It may be that
<a name="INDEX-43" /> <a name="INDEX-44" />Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
will solve some or all of this problem, but it is impossible at this
point to say with any certainty.
</p>

<p>Finally, there is a lack of <a name="INDEX-45" />media types in CSS1. In other words, CSS1
is primarily a screen-device language, intended to be used to put
content onto a computer monitor. There is some thought toward
<a name="INDEX-46" />paged media,
like printouts, but not much. (Despite this, CSS1 is not a
pixel-perfect control mechanism.) In an effort to overcome this
limitation, CSS2 introduces media types, which makes it possible to
create separate style sheets that are applied to a document depending
on its display media. CSS2 also introduces properties and behavior
specifically aimed at paged media and <a name="INDEX-47" />aural media.
</p>

<a name="css-CHP-1-SECT-3.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">1.3.2. Implementations</h3>

<p>Sadly, the major drawback to using CSS is that it was so poorly
implemented at first. Through a combination of miscommunication,
misinterpretation, confusion, and poor quality control, the first
browsers to attempt support of CSS did a rather poor job of it.
</p>

<p>The worst offenders are Microsoft <a name="INDEX-48" /> <a name="INDEX-49" />
<a name="INDEX-50" />Internet Explorer 3.x and
<a name="INDEX-51" />Netscape Navigator 4.x. The
first in their respective lines to attempt CSS support, these
browsers have incomplete, bug-ridden, and quite often contradictory
implementations of CSS1, never mind CSS2. These
<a name="INDEX-52" />
<a name="INDEX-53" />implementations are so bad that it is
difficult to consider them CSS-supporting at all. Some of their flaws
are bad enough to cause the browser to crash, or even lock up an
entire system, when trying to handle some styles.
</p>

<p>With Internet Explorer 4.x and 5.x, things did improve. Although not
perfect by any means, these browser versions did at least stomp out
many of the bugs that plagued IE3, and also added some support for
previously unrecognized CSS properties in both CSS1 and CSS2.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-54" />Opera 3.5, on the other hand, came out of
the gate with impressive CSS support. Confining itself to CSS1, this
browser did quite well with the properties that it supported,
suffering only a few minor bugs. When 3.6 was released, almost all of
these bugs were eliminated, although support did not move past CSS1.
Before version 3.5, Opera did not support CSS at all.
</p>

<p>As for Netscape's products, the Navigator 4.7 is not
significantly better at CSS support than was version 4.0, although
it's at least less crash-prone. The only real hope for good CSS
support out of Netscape is their <a name="INDEX-55" />Gecko rendering engine. As this was being
written, the latest builds of Gecko were quite excellent, and were in
fact used (along with Internet Explorer 4.5 and 5.0 for Macintosh) to
create many of the figures in this book.
</p>

<p>Since CSS is not intended to provide total control over document
display, and should allow the page's content to come through no
matter what browser is being used, this general state of affairs
should not be considered a barrier to the use of CSS. You may wish,
however, to warn your users that if they are using browsers of a
certain vintage (Explorer 3.x, and perhaps Navigator 4.x) that they
go into their preferences and disable style sheets. That way,
they'll at least be able to read the content of your pages,
even if it isn't styled the way you might have hoped.<a name="INDEX-56" />
