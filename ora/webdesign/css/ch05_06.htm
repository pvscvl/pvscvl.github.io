<h2 class="sect1">5.6. Font Matching</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-613" />
<a name="INDEX-614" />As we've seen, CSS allows for the
matching of font families, weights, and variants. This is done
through font matching, which is a vaguely complicated procedure.
Understanding it is important for authors who wish to help user
agents make good font selections when displaying their documents. I
left it for the end of this chapter because it's not really
necessary to understand how the font properties work, and some people
will probably want to skip this part and go on to <a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Colors and Backgrounds"</a>. If you're still interested,
here's how font matching works.
</p>

<p>In the first step of font matching, the user agent creates, or
otherwise accesses, a database of font properties. This database
lists the various CSS1 properties of all the fonts to which the UA
has access. Typically, this will be all fonts installed on the
machine, although there could be others (for example, the UA could
have its own built-in fonts). If the UA encounters two identical
fonts, it will simply ignore one of them.
</p>

<p>Second, the UA takes apart an element to determine which font
properties have been applied, and constructs a list of font
properties necessary for the display of that element. Based on that
list, the UA makes an initial choice of a font family to use in
displaying the element. If there is a complete match, then the UA can
use that font. Otherwise, it needs to do a little more work.
</p>

<p>Third, if there was no font match in step two, the UA looks for
alternate fonts within the same font family. If it finds any, then it
repeats step two for that font.
</p>

<p>Fourth, assuming a generic match has been found, but it doesn't
contain everything needed to display a given element -- the font
is missing the copyright symbol, for instance -- then the UA goes
back to step three, which entails a search for another alternate font
and another trip through step two.
</p>

<p>Finally, if no match has been made and all alternate fonts have been
tried, the UA selects the default font for the given generic font
family and does the best it can to display the element correctly.
</p>

<p>As you can see, step two gets visited a lot in this process. It can
be broken down into more precise steps:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p>A font is first matched against the <tt class="literal">font-style</tt>.
The keyword <tt class="literal">italic</tt> is matched by any font which is
labeled as either "italic" or "oblique." If
neither is available, then the match fails.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The next match attempt is on <tt class="literal">font-variant</tt>. Any
font which is not labeled "small-caps" is assumed to be
<tt class="literal">normal</tt>. A font can be matched to
<tt class="literal">small-caps</tt> by any font which is labeled as
"small-caps," by any font which allows the synthesis of a
small-caps style, or by any font where lowercase letters are replaced
by uppercase letters.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The next match is to <tt class="literal">font-weight</tt>, which can never
fail, thanks to the way <tt class="literal">font-weight</tt> is handled
under CSS1.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Finally, <tt class="literal">font-size</tt> is tackled. This must be
matched within a certain tolerance, but the tolerance is left to the
user agent to define. Thus, one user agent might allow matching
within a 20% margin of error, whereas another might allow only 10%
differences between the size specified and the size that is actually
used.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>The whole process is long and tedious, but it helps to understand how
user agents pick the fonts they do. For example, you might specify
the use of Times or any other serif font in a document, to get
what's shown in <a href="ch05_06.htm">Figure 5-34</a>.
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">BODY {font-family: Times, serif;}</pre></blockquote>

<a name="css-CHP-5-FIG-34" /><div class="figure"><img height="142" alt="Figure 5-34" src="figs/css.0534.gif" width="345" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 5-34. The end result of font matching</h4>

<p>For each element, the user agent should examine the characters in
that element and determine whether Times can provide characters to
match. In most cases, it can do so with no problem. Assume, however,
that a Chinese character has been placed in the middle of a
paragraph. Times has nothing that can match this character, so the
user agent has to either work around the character or look for
another font that can fulfill the needs of displaying that element.
Of course, any Western font is highly unlikely to contain Chinese
characters, but should one exist (let's call it AsiaTimes), the
user agent could use it in the display of that one element -- or
simply for the single character. Thus, the whole paragraph might be
displayed using AsiaTimes, or everything in the paragraph might be in
Times except for the single Chinese character, which is displayed in
AsiaTimes.<a name="INDEX-615" /> <a name="INDEX-616" />
