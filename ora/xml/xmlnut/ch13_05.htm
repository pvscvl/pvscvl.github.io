<h2 class="sect1">13.5. Choosing Between CSS and XSL-FO</h2>

<p><a name="IXT-13-239917" />
<a name="IXT-13-239918" />CSS is a
very straightforward, easy-to-learn, easy-to-use language for
formatting web pages. To the extent that CSS has gotten a reputation
as buggy and difficult to use, that's mostly because
of inconsistent, nonstandard browser implementations. Opera 4.0 and
later, Netscape 6.0 and later, and Mozilla provide extensive support
for most features of <a name="IXT-13-239919" /> <a name="IXT-13-239920" />CSS <a name="IXT-13-239921" />Level 2 with only a few minor bugs.
Internet Explorer's support is much weaker, but
borders on usable.
</p>

<p>It's <a name="IXT-13-239922" />hard to imagine any text-based web site
you can't produce by using XSLT to transform a
document into HTML and then applying a CSS stylesheet. Alternately,
you can transform the XML document into another XML document and
apply the CSS stylesheet to that. If the element content in the
original XML document is in fact exactly what you want to display in
the output document, in the correct order, you can even omit the XSLT
transformation step, as we did in Examples <a href="ch12_01.htm">Example 12-1</a> and <a href="ch12_02.htm">Example 12-2</a> in the last
chapter.
</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, CSS is already well understood by web
designers and well supported by current browsers. XSL-FO is not
directly supported by any browsers. To view an XSL-FO document, you
must first convert it into the inconvenient <a name="IXT-13-239923" />PDF format. PDF does
not adjust as well as HTML to the wide variety of monitors and screen
sizes in use today. Viewing it inside a web browser requires a
special plug-in. The limited third party tools that support XSL-FO
are beta quality at best. Personally, we see little reason to use
anything other than CSS on the Web.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, XSL-FO does go beyond CSS in some respects that
are important for high-quality printing. For example, XSL-FO offers
multiple column layouts; CSS doesn't. XSL-FO can
condition formatting on what's actually in the
document; CSS can't. XSL-FO allows you to place
footnotes, running headers, and other information in the margins of a
page; CSS doesn't. XSL-FO lets you insert page
numbers and automatically cross-reference particular pages by number;
CSS doesn't. And for printing, the requirement to
render into PDF is much less limiting and annoying since the ultimate
delivery mechanism is paper anyway. CSS Level 3 will add some of
these features, but it will still focus on ease-of-use and web-based
presentation rather than high-quality printing. Once the software is
more reliable and complete, XSL-FO should be the clear choice for
professionally typeset books, magazines, newspapers, and other
printed matter that's rendered from XML documents.
It should be very competitive with other solutions like Quark XPress,
TEX, troff, and FrameMaker. CSS does not even attempt to compete in
this area.
</p>

<p>The bottom line is this: CSS is right for web pages; XSL-FO is right
for printed matter. XSLT is a crucial step in getting an input
document ready for eventual presentation with either CSS or
<a name="IXTR3-156" />XSL-FO.
