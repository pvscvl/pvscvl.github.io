<h2 class="sect1">10.2. Link Behavior</h2>

<p>So <a name="xmlnut2-IDXTERM-989" />far, <a name="xmlnut2-IDXTERM-990" />we've been careful
to talk in the abstract. We've said that an XLink
describes a connection between two resources, but we
haven't said much about how that connection is
presented to the end user or what it makes software reading the
document do. That's because there
isn't one answer to these questions.
<a name="IXT-10-240558" />For instance, when the browser encounters a
<tt class="literal">novel</tt> element that uses an
<em class="filename">http</em> URL, clicking the link should probably load
the text of the novel from the URL into the current window, thereby
replacing the document that contained the link. Then again, maybe it
should open a new window and show the user the new document in that
window. The proper behavior for a browser encountering the
<tt class="literal">novel</tt> element that uses an <a href="isbn">isbn</a> URN is even less clear. Perhaps it
should reserve the book with the specified ISBN at the local library
for the user to walk in and pick up. Or perhaps it should order the
book from an online bookstore. In other cases something else entirely
may be called for. For instance, the content of some links are
embedded directly in the linking document, as in this
<a name="IXT-10-240559" /><tt class="literal">image</tt> element:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;image width="152" height="345" xlink:type="simple"
       xlink:href="http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/pi1/bus.jpg" /&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Here, the author most likely intends the browser to download and
display the image as soon as it finds the link. And rather than
opening a new window for the image or replacing the current document
with the image, the image should be embedded into the current
document.
</p>

<p>Just as XML is more flexible than HTML in the documents it describes,
so too is XLink more flexible in the links it describes. An XLink
indicates that there's a connection between two
documents, but it's up to the application reading
the XLink to decide what that connection means. It's
not necessarily a blue, underlined phrase on which the user clicks in
a browser to jump from the first source document to the target. It
may indeed be that, just as an XML document may be a web page, but it
may be something else too.
</p>

<p>Page authors can offer suggestions to browsers about how links should
be handled by using the <tt class="literal">xlink:show</tt> and
<tt class="literal">xlink:actuate</tt> attributes. The
<tt class="literal">xlink:show</tt> attribute tells a browser or other
application what to do when the link is activated, for example,
whether to show the linked content in the same window or to open a
new window to display it. The <tt class="literal">xlink:actuate</tt>
attribute tells the browser when to show the content, for example,
whether it should follow the link as soon as it sees it or whether it
should wait for an explicit user request.
</p>

<a name="xmlnut2-CHP-10-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.2.1. xlink:show</h3>

<p>The optional
<tt class="literal">xlink:show</tt><a name="IXT-10-240560" /> <a name="IXT-10-240561" /> attribute has five possible values that
suggest in what context the application loading an XLinked resource
should display that resource:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt class="literal">new</tt></dt>
<dd>
Open a new window and show the content of the link's
URI (the ending resource) in that window.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><tt class="literal">replace</tt></dt>
<dd>
Show the ending resource in the current window, replacing the current
document.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><tt class="literal">embed</tt></dt>
<dd>
Embed the ending resource in the current document at the location of
the link element.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><tt class="literal">other</tt></dt>
<dd>
Exhibit some behavior other than opening a new window, replacing the
document in the existing window or embedding the resource in the
existing document. Exactly what that behavior is may be specified by
other, nonstandard markup that a particular application understands.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><tt class="literal">none</tt></dt>
<dd>
Specify no behavior.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>All five of these are only suggestions that browsers or other
applications following XLinks are free to ignore. For example, a web
spider would not open a window for any link and might ignore embedded
links and treat the other four types identically. Mozilla might open
a new tab in an existing window for
<tt class="literal">xlink:show="new"</tt> rather than creating a completely
new window. This is all allowed as long as it makes sense in the
context of the application.
</p>

</div>
<a name="xmlnut2-CHP-10-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">10.2.2. xlink:actuate</h3>

<p>The optional
<tt class="literal">xlink:actuate</tt><a name="IXT-10-240562" /> <a name="IXT-10-240563" /> attribute has four possible values,
which suggest when an application that encounters an XLink should
<a name="IXT-10-240564" />follow
it:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt class="literal">onLoad</tt></dt>
<dd>
The link should be followed as soon as the application sees it.</p>
</dd>


<dt><tt class="literal">onRequest</tt></dt>
<dd>
The link should be followed when the user asks to follow it.</p>
</dd>


<dt><tt class="literal">other</tt></dt>
<dd>
When to follow the link is determined by other markup in the document
not specified by XLink.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><tt class="literal">none</tt></dt>
<dd>
No details are available about when or whether to follow this link.
Indeed, following the link may not have any plausible meaning as in
the previous example where the link pointed to a
book's ISBN number rather than a URL where the book
could be found.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>All four of these are only suggestions that browsers or other
applications following XLinks are free to ignore. For example, a web
spider would use its own algorithms to decide when to follow and not
follow a link. Differing behavior when faced with the same attributes
is allowed as long as it makes sense for the application reading the
document.
</p>

<p>For example, a traditional link such as is provided by
HTML's <tt class="literal">A</tt> element and indicated by
the first novel example would be encoded like this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;novel xlink:type="simple"
       xlink:href="ftp://archive.org/pub/etext/etext93/wizoz10.txt"
<b class="emphasis-bold">       xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="replace"&gt;</b>
  &lt;title&gt;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;author&gt;L. Frank Baum&lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;year&gt;1900&lt;/year&gt;
&lt;/novel&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>This says to wait for an explicit user request to follow the link
(e.g., clicking on the content of the link) and then to replace the
existing document with the document found at <a href="ftp://archive.org/pub/etext/etext93/wizoz10.txt">ftp://archive.org/pub/etext/etext93/wizoz10.txt</a>.
On the other hand, if you were using XLinks to embed images in
documents, you'd want them traversed immediately and
then embedded in the originating document. The following syntax would
be appropriate:
</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;image xlink:type="simple"
<b class="emphasis-bold">       xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed"</b>
       xlink:href="http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/pi1/bus.jpg"
       width="152" height="345" /&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Both <tt class="literal">xlink:show</tt> and
<tt class="literal">xlink:actuate</tt> are optional. An application should
be prepared to do something reasonable if <a name="IXTR3-231" />they're <a name="IXTR3-232" />missing.
