<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>


<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>

<p>The bird on the cover of <em>XML in a Nutshell</em>, Second Edition, is a
peafowl, the largest bird in the Phasianinae family, which also
includes pheasants and turkeys. People often incorrectly call peafowl
peacocks. Peacocks are actually male peafowl; the females are called
peahens. Two wild peafowl species exist today: the Indian peafowl
(<em>Pavo cristatus</em>) and the Green peafowl of Southeast Asia (<em>Pavo
muticus</em>), which may be endangered. These wild peafowl live in musters
of 8 to 12 birds in dense forest near water. Though they do not fly
very well, and do so only for short distances, they do manage to
escape most predators and roost peacefully at night, high up in
treetops.</p>

<p>The peafowl's most famous characteristic, of course, is its
beautiful fan of feathers, known as a "train." Each blue-green train
feather has a dark spot on its tip that looks much like an
eye. Peacocks develop especially brilliant plumage, an indicator of
sexual maturity, by age three. A healthy peacock has a full and
vibrant train each year during the spring mating season. During this
period, peacocks strut their stuff-display their "breeding plumage,"
as it is called-to attract peahens. Scientists theorize that the
peacock's performance plays upon the peahen's instinctive drives to
find healthy mates in the hope of producing hardy offspring. Each
summer after the mating season, peafowl shed their train feathers,
which are often collected by humans as eye-catching souvenirs.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Holcomb was the production editor and copyeditor for <em>XML
in a Nutshell</em>, Second Edition. Jane Ellin and Sarah Sherman were the
proofreaders. Matt Hutchinson, Tatiana Apandi Diaz, and Claire
Cloutier provided quality control. Linley Dolby and Mary Brady
provided production assistance. Judy Hoer wrote the index.</p>

<p>Ellie Volckhausen designed the cover of this book, based on a
series design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is an original
illustration created by Susan Hart. Emma Colby produced the cover
layout with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond font.</p> 

<p>Melanie Wang designed the interior layout, based on a series
design by David Futato. This book was converted to FrameMaker 5.5.6
with a format conversion tool created by Erik Ray, Jason McIntosh,
Neil Walls, and Mike Sierra that uses Perl and XML technologies. The
text font is Linotype Birka; the heading font is Adobe Myriad
Condensed; and the code font is LucasFont's TheSans Mono
Condensed. Additional fonts used in this book include TibetanMachine,
Code2000, Adobe MathematicalPi2, and Adobe MathematicalPi6. The
illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano
and Jessamyn Read using Macromedia FreeHand 9 and Adobe Photoshop
6. The tip and warning icons were drawn by Christopher Bing. This
colophon was written by Sarah Jane Shangraw and Molly Shangraw.</p>
