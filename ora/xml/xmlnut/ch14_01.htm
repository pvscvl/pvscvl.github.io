Language, is an XML application invented by Jonathan
<a name="IXT-14-241048" />Borden, Tim
<a name="IXT-14-241049" />Bray, and various
other members of the xml-dev mailing list to describe XML
applications identified by <a name="xmlnut2-IDXTERM-1304" /> <a name="xmlnut2-IDXTERM-1305" />namespace URLs. A RDDL document lives at
the namespace URL for the application it describes. RDDL is a hybrid
of XHTML Basic and one custom element,
<tt class="literal">rddl:resource</tt>. A
<tt class="literal">rddl:resource</tt><a name="xmlnut2-IDXTERM-1306" /> <a name="xmlnut2-IDXTERM-1307" /> element is a simple XLink that points to
a resource related to the application the RDDL document describes.
Humans with browsers can read the XHTML parts to learn about the
application. Software can read the <tt class="literal">rddl:resource</tt>
elements.

<h2 class="sect1">14.1. What's at the End of a Namespace URL?</h2>

<p>The people who wrote the namespaces specification
couldn't agree on what should be put at the end of a
namespace URL. Should it be a DTD, a schema, a specification
document, a stylesheet, software for processing the application, or
something else? All of these are possible, but none of them are
required for any particular XML application. Some applications have
DTDs; some don't. Some applications have schemas;
some don't. Some applications have stylesheets; some
don't. Thus, for the most part, namespaces have been
purely formal identifiers. They do not actually locate or identify
anything.
</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">Namespaces in XML</em> specifically states that
"The namespace name, to serve its intended purpose,
should have the characteristics of uniqueness and persistence. It is
not a goal that it be directly usable for retrieval of a schema (if
any exists)." That is, it is not required that there
be anything in particular, such as a DTD or a schema, at the end of
the namespace URL. Indeed, it's not even required
that the namespace name be potentially resolvable. It might be an
irresolvable URN such as <em class="emphasis">urn:isbn:1565922247</em>. On the other hand, this
doesn't say that there can't be
anything at the end of a namespace URL, just that there
doesn't have to be.
</p>

<p>Nonetheless, this hasn't stopped numerous developers
from typing namespace URLs into their web browser location bars and
filling the error logs at the W3C and elsewhere with 404 Not Found
errors. It hasn't stopped weekly questions on the
xml-dev mailing list about whether it's possible to
parse an XML document on a system that's
disconnected from the Net. Eventually, the membership of the xml-dev
mailing list reached consensus that it was time to put something at
the end of namespace URLs, even if they didn't have
to.
</p>

<p>However, the question still remained, what to put there? All the
reasons for not choosing any one thing to put at the end of a
namespace URL still applied. Rick <a name="IXT-14-241050" />Jelliffe suggested fixing the problem by
introducing an additional layer of indirection, and Tim Bray proposed
doing it with XHTML and XLinks. Instead of putting just one of these
at the end of the namespace URL, an XML document containing a list of
all the things related to the XML application identified by that
particular URL could be put at the end of the namespace URL.
</p>

<p>Experience had proven that when presented with a string beginning
with http, developers would type it into a browser location
bar.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a> Therefore, the basic syntax of RDDL had to be something
that looked reasonable when loaded into a browser: preferably, HTML.
Furthermore, to make machine processing simple, it also had to be
well-formed, perhaps valid, XML. Naturally, XHTML came to mind, and
modular XHTML provided just enough extensibility to permit the extra
syntax RDDL needed.
</p><blockquote class="footnote"> <a name="FOOTNOTE-7" /><p> [7]In the immortal words of Claude L.
<a name="IXT-14-241051" />Bullard,
"All the handwaving about URN/URI/URL
doesn't avoid the simple fact that if one puts
http:// anywhere in browser display space, the system colors it blue
and puts up a finger. The monkey expects a resource and when it
doesn't get one, it shocks the monkey. Monkeys
don't read specs to find out why they should be
shocked. They turn red and put up a finger."</p>
