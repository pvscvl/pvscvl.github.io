for web pages, books, scholarly articles, poems, short stories,
reference manuals, tutorials, textbooks, legal pleadings, contracts,
instruction sheets, and other documents that human beings would read.
Its use as a syntax for computer data in applications such as order
processing, object serialization, database exchange and backup, and
electronic data interchange is mostly a happy accident.
</p><p>Most computer programmers are better trained in working with the
rigid structures one encounters in data-oriented applications than in
the more free-form environment of an article or story. Most writers
are more accustomed to the more free-form format of a book, story, or
article. XML is perhaps unique in addressing the needs of both
communities equally well. This chapter describes by both elucidation
and example the structures encountered in documents that are meant to
be read by people instead of computers. Subsequent chapters will look
at web pages in particular, then address technologies such as XSLT,
XLinks, and stylesheets that are primarily intended for use with
documents that will be read by human beings. Once
we've done that, we'll look at XML
as a format for more or less transitory data meant to be read by
computers, rather than semipermanent documents intended for human
consumption.

<h2 class="sect1">6.1. SGML's Legacy</h2>

<p>XML <a name="IXT-6-239992" />is a
simplified form of the Standardized General Markup Language (SGML).
The language that would eventually become SGML was invented by
Charles F. <a name="IXT-6-239993" />Goldfarb, Ed <a name="IXT-6-239994" />Mosher, and Ray <a name="IXT-6-239995" />Lorie at IBM in the 1970s and developed by
several hundred people around the world until its eventual adoption
as ISO standard 8879 in 1986. SGML was intended to solve many of the
same problems XML solves in much the same way as XML solves them. It
was and is a semantic and structural markup language for text
documents. SGML is extremely powerful and achieved some success in
the U.S. military and government, in the aerospace sector, and in
other domains that needed ways of efficiently managing technical
documents that were tens of thousands of pages long.
</p>

<p>SGML's biggest success was HTML, which was and is an
SGML application. However, HTML is just one SGML application. It does
not have anything close to the full power of SGML itself. SGML has
also been used to define many other document formats, including
DocBook and TEI, both of which we'll discuss
shortly.
</p>

<p>However, SGML is complicated--very, very complicated. The
official SGML specification is over 150 very technical pages. It
covers many special cases and unlikely scenarios. It is so complex
that almost no software has ever implemented it fully. Programs that
implement or rely on different subsets of SGML are often
incompatible. The special feature that one program considers
essential is all too often considered extraneous fluff and omitted by
the next program. Nonetheless, experience with SGML taught developers
a lot about the proper design, implementation, and use of markup
languages for a wide variety of documents. Much of that general
knowledge applies equally well to XML.
</p>

<p>One thing all this should make clear is that XML documents
aren't just used on the Web. XML can easily handle
the needs of publishing in a variety of media, including books,
magazines, journals, newspapers, and pamphlets. XML is particularly
useful when you need to publish the same information in several of
these formats. By applying different stylesheets to the same source
document, you can produce web pages, speaker's
notes, camera-ready copy for printing, and more.
