<h2 class="sect1">10.5. Linkbases</h2>

<p>One of <a name="IXT-10-240599" />the most revolutionary features of
XLinks is the ability to define links between documents you
don't control. For instance, <a href="ch10_04.htm">Example 10-1</a> is an extended link that describes and links
three documents neither of the authors of this book has anything to
do with. Links between purely <a name="IXT-10-240600" />remote resources are called
<em class="emphasis">third-party links</em><a name="IXT-10-240601" />
<a name="IXT-10-240602" />.
A third-party link is created when an arc's
<tt class="literal">xlink:from</tt> and <tt class="literal">xlink:to</tt>
attributes both contain labels for locator elements. Links from a
remote resource to a local resource are called <em class="emphasis">inbound
links</em><a name="IXT-10-240603" />
<a name="IXT-10-240604" />.
An inbound link is created when an arc's
<tt class="literal">xlink:from</tt> attribute contains the label of a
locator element and its <tt class="literal">xlink:to</tt> attribute
contains the label of a resource element. Links from a local resource
to a remote resource are called <em class="emphasis">outbound
links</em><a name="IXT-10-240605" />. An outbound link is established when an
arc's <tt class="literal">xlink:from</tt><a name="IXTR3-239" /> <a name="IXTR3-240" /> attribute contains
the label of a resource element and its
<tt class="literal">xlink:to</tt><a name="IXTR3-241" /> <a name="IXTR3-242" /> attribute contains the label of a
locator element. Simple links are also outbound links.
</p>

<p>An XML document that contains any inbound or third-party links is
called a
<em class="emphasis">linkbase</em><a name="IXT-10-240606" />.
A linkbase establishes links from documents other than the linkbase
itself, perhaps documents that the author of the linkbase does not
own and cannot control. Exactly how a <a name="IXT-10-240607" />browser or other application will load a
linkbase and discover the links there is still an open question. It
will probably involve visiting a web site that provides the linkbase.
When the browser sees the extended link that attempts to establish
links from a third web site, it should ask the user whether he wishes
to accept the suggested links. It might even use the
<tt class="literal">xlink:role</tt> and <tt class="literal">xlink:title</tt>
attributes to help the user make this decision, though if past
experience with cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls is any
guide, the initial user interfaces are likely to be quite poor and
the choices offered quite limited.
</p>

<p>Once a browser has loaded a linkbase and arrived at a page
that's referenced as the starting resource of one or
more of the links in the linkbase, it should make this fact known to
the user somehow and give them a means to traverse the link. Once
again the user interface for this activity remains to be designed.
Perhaps it will be a pop-up window showing the third-party links
associated with a page. Or perhaps it will simply embed the links in
the page, but use a different color underlining. The user could still
activate them in exactly the same way they activate a normal HTML
link.
</p>

<p>If this is the scheme that's adopted, then it would
be useful if the starting resource of the link
didn't have to be an entire document, but could
rather be just one part of it, such as a specific paragraph, personal
name, or book title. Indeed, you can attach an XPointer to the URI
identifying the starting resource of the link that chooses a
particular part of or point in the starting document. This will be
the subject of <a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11</a>.
