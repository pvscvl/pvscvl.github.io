<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1><p>XML is one of the most important developments in document syntax in
the history of computing. In the last few years it has been adopted
in fields as diverse as law, aeronautics, finance, insurance,
robotics, multimedia, hospitality, travel, art, construction,
telecommunications, software, agriculture, physics, journalism,
theology, retail, and comics. XML has become the syntax of choice for
newly designed document formats across almost all computer
applications. It's used on Linux, Windows,
Macintosh, and many other computer platforms. Mainframes on Wall
Street trade stocks with one another by exchanging XML documents.
Children playing games on their home PCs save their documents in XML.
Sports fans receive real-time game scores on their cell phones in
XML. XML is simply the most robust, reliable, and flexible document
syntax ever invented.
</p><p><em class="emphasis">XML in a Nutshell</em> is a comprehensive guide to
the rapidly growing world of XML. It covers all aspects of XML, from
the most basic syntax rules, to the details of DTD and schema
creation, to the APIs you can use to read and write XML documents in
a variety of programming languages.
</p><div class="sect1"><a name="xmlnut2-PREF-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">0.1. What This Book Covers</h2>

<p>There are hundreds of formally established XML applications from the
W3C and other standards bodies, such as OASIS and the Object
Management Group. There are even more informal, unstandardized
applications from individuals and corporations, such as
Microsoft's Channel Definition Format and John
Guajardo's Mind Reading Markup Language. This book
cannot cover them all, any more than a book on Java could discuss
every program that has ever been or might ever be written in Java.
This book focuses primarily on XML itself. It covers the fundamental
rules that all XML documents and authors must adhere to, whether a
web designer uses SMIL to add animations to web pages or a C++
programmer uses SOAP to exchange serialized objects with a remote
database.
</p>

<p>This book also covers generic supporting technologies that have been
layered on top of XML and are used across a wide range of XML
applications. These technologies include:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>XLink</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239356" /> <a name="IXT-0-239357" />An attribute-based
syntax for hyperlinks between XML and non-XML documents that provide
the simple, one-directional links familiar from HTML,
multidirectional links between many documents, and links between
documents to which you don't have write access.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>XSLT</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239358" />An XML application that
describes transformations from one document to another, in either the
same or different XML vocabularies.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>XPointer</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239359" />A syntax for
<a name="IXT-0-239360" />URI fragment identifiers that selects
particular parts of the XML document referred to by the
URI--often used in conjunction with an XLink.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>XPath</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239361" />A non-XML syntax used
by both XPointer and XSLT for identifying particular pieces of XML
documents. For example, an XPath can locate the third
<tt class="literal">address</tt> element in the document, or all elements
with an <tt class="literal">email</tt> attribute whose value is
<tt class="literal">elharo@metalab.unc.edu</tt>.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Namespaces</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239362" />A means of
distinguishing between elements and attributes from different XML
vocabularies that have the same name; for instance, the title of a
book and the title of a web page in a web page about books.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>Schemas</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239363" />An XML vocabulary
for describing the permissible contents of XML documents from other
XML vocabularies.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>SAX</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239364" />
<a name="IXT-0-239365" />The Simple API for XML, an
event-based application programming interface implemented by many XML
parsers.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>DOM</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239366" />
<a name="IXT-0-239367" />The Document Object Model, a
language-neutral tree-oriented API that treats an XML document as a
set of nested objects with various properties.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>XHTML</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239368" />An XMLized version of
HTML that can be extended with other XML applications such as MathML
and SVG.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>RDDL</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239369" />The
<a name="IXT-0-239370" />Resource Directory Description
Language, an XML application based on XHTML for documents placed at
the end of namespace URLs.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>All these technologies, whether defined in XML (XLinks, XSLT,
Namespaces, Schemas, XHTML, and RDDL) or in another syntax
(XPointers, XPath, SAX, and DOM), are used in many different XML
applications.
</p>

<p>This book does not specifically cover XML applications that are
relevant to only some users of XML, such as:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>SVG</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239371" />Scalable
<a name="IXT-0-239372" />Vector Graphics, a
<a name="IXT-0-239373" /> <a name="IXT-0-239374" />W3C-endorsed standard
XML encoding of line art.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>MathML</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239375" />The Mathematical Markup Language, a
W3C-endorsed standard XML application used for embedding equations in
web pages and other documents.
</p>
</dd>


<dt><i>RDF</i></dt>
<dd>
<a name="IXT-0-239376" />The Resource Description Framework, a
W3C-standard XML application used for describing resources, with a
particular focus on the sort of metadata one might find in a library
card catalog.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Occasionally we use one or more of these applications in an example,
but we do not cover all aspects of the relevant vocabulary in depth.
While interesting and important, these applications (and hundreds
more like them) are intended primarily for use with special software
that knows their format intimately. For instance, most graphic
designers do not work directly with SVG. Instead, they use their
customary tools, such as Adobe Illustrator, to create SVG documents.
They may not even know they're using XML.
</p>

<p>This book focuses on standards that are relevant to almost all
developers working with XML. We investigate XML technologies that
span a wide range of XML applications, not those that are relevant
only within a few restricted domains.
