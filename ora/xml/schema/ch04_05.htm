<h3 class="sect2">4.5.1. The Realm of ISO 8601</h3>

<p>The <a name="INDEX-191" />W3C Recommendation,
"XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes,"
provides new confirmation of how difficult it is to fix time.
</p>

<p>The support for date and time datatypes relies entirely on a subset
of the ISO 8601 standard, which is the only format supported by W3C
XML Schema. The purpose of ISO 8601 is to eliminate the risk of
confusion between the various date and time formats used in different
countries. In other words, W3C XML Schema does not support these
local date and time formats, and imposes the usage of ISO 8601 for
any datatype that has the semantic of a date or time. While this is a
good thing for interchange formats, this is more questionable when
XML is used to define user interfaces, since we will see that ISO
8601 is not very user friendly. The variations using the names of the
months or different orders between year, month, and day are not the
only victims of this decision: ISO 8601 imposes the usage of the
Gregorian (Christian) calendar to the exclusion of calendars used by
other cultures or religions.
</p>

<p>ISO 8601 describes several formats to define date, times, periods,
and recurring dates, with different levels of precision and
indetermination. After many discussions, W3C XML Schema selected a
subset of these formats and created a primitive datatype for each
format that is supported.
</p>

<p>The indeterminacy allowed in some of these formats adds a lot of
difficulty, especially when comparisons or arithmetic are involved.
For instance, it is possible to define a point in time without
specifying the <a name="INDEX-192" />time zone, which is then
considered undetermined. This undetermined time zone is identical all
over the document (and between the schema and the instance documents)
and it's not an issue to compare two datetimes
without a time zone. The problem arises when you need to compare two
points in time, one with a time zone and the other without. The
result of this comparison will be undetermined if these values are
too close, since one of them may be between -13 hours and +12 hours
of <a name="INDEX-193" /> <a name="INDEX-194" />Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
Thus, the support of these datetime datatypes introduces a notion of
"partial order relation."
</p>

<p>Another caveat with ISO 8601 is that time zones are only supported
through the time difference from UTC, which ignores the notion of
summer time. For instance, if an application working in
<a name="INDEX-195" />
<a name="INDEX-196" />British Summer Time (BST) wants to specify
the time zone--and we have seen that this is necessary to be
able to compare datetimes--the application needs to know if a
date is in summer (the time zone will be one hour after UTC) or in
winter (the time zone would then be UTC). ISO 8601 ignores the
"named time zones" using the summer
saving times (such as PST, BST, or WET) that we use in our day-to-day
life; ignoring the time zones can be seen as a somewhat dangerous
shortcut to specify that a datetime is on your
"local time," whatever it is.

<a name="INDEX-197" />The <tt class="literal"><a href="ch16_01.htm">xs:dateTime</a></tt> <a name="INDEX-198" />datatype defines a
"specific instant of time." This is
a subset of what ISO 8601 calls a "moment of
time." Its lexical value follows the format
"CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss," in which all
the fields must be present and may optionally be preceded by a sign
and leading figures, if needed, and followed by fractional digits for
the seconds and a time zone. The time zone may be specified using the
letter "Z," which identifies UTC,
or by the difference of time with UTC.
</p>




<a name="ch04-13-fm2xml" /><blockquote><b>TIP:</b> 
The value space of <tt class="literal"><a href="ch16_01.htm">xs:dateTime</a></tt> is considered to be
the moment of time itself. The time zone that defines the value (when
there is one) is considered meaningless, which is a problem for some
applications that complain that even though
<tt class="literal">2002-01-18T12:00:00+00:00</tt> and
<tt class="literal">2002-01-18T11:00:00-01:00</tt> refer to the same

different time zone information, which should make its way into the

</blockquote>

<p>The first one (<tt class="literal">2001-10-26T21:32:52</tt>), which
doesn't include a time zone specification, is
considered to have an indeterminate value between
<tt class="literal">2001-10-26T21:32:52-14:00</tt> and
<tt class="literal">2001-10-26T21:32:52+14:00</tt>. With the usage of
summer saving time, this range is subject to national regulations and
may change. The range was between -13:00 and +12:00 when the
Recommendation was published, but the Working Group has kept a margin
to accommodate possible changes in the regulations.
</p>

<p>Despite the indeterminacy of the time zone when none is specified,
the W3C XML Schema Recommendation considers that the values of
datetimes without time zones implicitly refer to the same
undetermined time zone and can be compared between them. While this
is fine for "local" applications
that operate in a single time zone, this is a source of potential
confusion and errors for world-wide applications or even for
applications that calculate a duration between moments belonging to
different time saving seasons within a single time zone.

<dd>
<a name="INDEX-207" />
<a name="INDEX-208" />Naive
programmers who think that the concept of duration is simple should
read the Recommendation, which states: <tt class="literal"><a href="ch16_01.htm">xs:duration</a></tt> is defined as a six-dimensional
space!" Mathematicians would object that this is not
absolutely true since most of the axes of these dimension are
parallel, but the fact is that when these programmers say that a
development will last one month and 3 days, they define a duration
that is comprised of between 31 and 34 days. The attempt of W3C XML
Schema to deal with these issues on top of ISO 8601 has introduced a
degree of indeterminacy in the comparisons between durations.
</p>


<p>The lexical space of <tt class="literal"><a href="ch16_01.htm">xs:duration</a></tt> is the format
defined by ISO 8601 under the form <tt class="literal">PnYnMnDTnHnMnS</tt>,
in which the capital letters are delimiters that can be omitted when
the corresponding member is not used. An important difference with
the format used for <tt class="literal"><a href="ch16_01.htm">xs:dateTime</a></tt> is none of these
members are mandatory and none of them are restricted to a range.
This gives flexibility to choose the units that will be used and to
combine several of them--for instance,
<tt class="literal">P1Y2MT123S</tt> (1 year, 2 months, and 123 seconds).
This flexibility has a price; such a duration is not completely
defined: a year may have 365 or 366 days, and a period of two months
lasts between 59 and 62 days. Durations cannot always be compared and
the order between durations is partial. We will see, in the next
chapter, that user-defined datatypes can be derived from <tt class="literal"><a href="ch16_01.htm">xs:duration</a></tt>, which can restrict the components used to
express durations and insure that these indeterminations do not
happen.
</p>

<p>Since the value of a duration is fixed as soon as you give it a
starting point, the schema Working Group has identified four
datetimes:
</p>

<blockquote class="simplelist">

<p><tt class="literal">1696-09-01T00:00:00Z</tt></p>



<p><tt class="literal">1697-02-01T00:00:00Z</tt></p>



<p><tt class="literal">1903-03-01T00:00:00Z</tt></p>



<p><tt class="literal">1903-07-01T00:00:00Z</tt></p>

</blockquote>

<p>These cause the greatest deviations when durations mixing day, month,
and other components are added. The Working Group has determined that
the comparison of durations is undefined if--and only
if--the result of the comparison is different when each of these
