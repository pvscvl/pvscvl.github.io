<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>

<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>

<p>The animal on the cover of <em class="citetitle">XML Schema</em> is a Reeves's
pheasant. Reeves's pheasants originated in north and central
China. They are named after the man who first introduced the species
in England to be bred for game. The species is one of the most popular
types of pheasant to be held in captivity and can be found all over
the world.</p>

<p>Reeves's pheasants are black, white, and bronze in color. Male
pheasants have white heads with black stripes across their eyes
resembling masks, while females have gold heads with light brown
masks. Most remarkable are the birds' tail feathers, which can reach
six feet long. These long tail feathers have historically been used in
ceremonies.</p>

<p>Hens produce two or more clutches of 8 to 14 eggs per
season. The eggs are olive brown or cream color, and hatch after 24
days. They have to be separated from other chicks, especially of
different species, soon after birth, as they tend to be quite
aggressive. Dominant male Reeves's pheasants are also quite aggressive
and need to be separated when held in captivity.</p>

<p>Darren Kelly was the production editor, Mary Brady was the
copyeditor, and Tatiana Diaz was the proofreader for <em class="citetitle">XML Schema</em>. Mary
Anne Weeks Mayo and Claire Cloutier provided quality control. Interior
composition was done by Philip Dangler, Matt Hutchinson, and Emily
Quill. Judy Hoer wrote the index.</p>

<p>Hanna Dyer designed the cover of this book, based on a series
design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is a 19th-century engraving
from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Emma Colby produced the cover layout
with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond font. </p>

<p>David Futato designed the interior layout. This book was
converted to FrameMaker 5.5.6 with a format conversion tool created by
Erik Ray, Jason McIntosh, Neil Walls, and Mike Sierra that uses Perl
and XML technologies. The text font is Linotype Birka; the heading
font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is LucasFont's
TheSans Mono Condensed. The illustrations that appear in the book were
produced by Robert Romano and Jessamyn Read using Macromedia FreeHand
9 and Adobe Photoshop 6. The tip and warning icons were drawn by
Christopher Bing. This colophon was written by Linley Dolby.</p>
