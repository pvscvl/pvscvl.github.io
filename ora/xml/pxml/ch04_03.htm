<h2 class="sect1">4.3. The Parser as Commodity</h2>

<p>You<a name="INDEX-333" /> don't have to write
an XML processing program that separates parser from handler, but
doing so can be advantageous. By making your program modular, you
make it easier to organize and test your code. The ideal way to
modularize is with objects, communicating on sanctioned channels and
otherwise leaving one another alone. Modularization makes swapping
one part for another easier, which is very important in XML
processing.
</p>

<p>The XML stream, as we said before, is an abstraction, which makes the
source of data irrelevant. It's like the spigot you
have in the backyard, to which you can hook up a hose and water your
lawn. It doesn't matter where you plug it in, you
just want the water. There's nothing special about
the hose either. As long as it doesn't leak and it
reaches where you want to go, you don't care if
it's made of rubber or bark. Similarly, XML parsers
have become a commodity: something you can download, plug in, and see
it work as expected. Plugging it in easily, however, is the tricky
part.
</p>

<p>The key is the screwhead on the end of the spigot.
It's a standard gauge of pipe that uses a specific
thread size, and any hose you buy should fit. With XML event streams,
we also need a standard interface there. XML developers have settled
on SAX, which has been in use for a few years now. Until recently,
Perl XML parsers were not interchangeable. Each had its own
interface, making it difficult to swap out one in favor of another.
That's changing now, as developers adopt SAX and
agree on conventions for hooking up handlers to parsers.
We'll see some of the fruits of this effort in <a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "SAX"</a>.
