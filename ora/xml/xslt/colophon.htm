<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>








<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>


<p>The animal on the cover of <em class="citetitle">XSLT</em> is a jabiru. Standing up to five
feet tall and with a wingspan of eight feet, this wading stork is the
largest flying bird in the western hemisphere. The bird's habitat
ranges from southern Mexico to northern Argentina, and much of its
migrating population is found in Belize from November through
July. Its habitat generally includes coastal areas, savannas, and
marshes. The jabiru population has steadily decreased over the past
decades due to hunting and deforestation, but some areas of Central
America have seen a slow recovery in the bird's population.</p>
 
<p>Ann Schirmer was the production editor and copyeditor for
<em class="citetitle">XSLT</em>. Linley Dolby  and Jeffrey Holcomb were the proofreaders . Claire
Cloutier, Emily Quill, and Rachel Wheeler provided quality
control. Brenda Miller wrote the index. Interior composition was done
by Ann Schirmer. Emma Colby designed the cover of this book, based on
a series design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is an original
antique engraving from the 19th century. Emma Colby produced the cover
layout with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond font.</p>
 
<p>David Futato designed the interior layout, based on a series design by Nancy Priest. This book was written entirely in XML. The book's print version was created by translating the XML source into a set of gtroff macros using a Perl filter developed by Norman Walsh. Erik Ray wrote extensions to the filter. Steve Talbott designed and wrote the underlying macro set on the basis of the GNU gtroff -ms macros; Lenny Muellner adapted them to XML and implemented the book design. The GNU groff text formatter Version 1.11 was used to generate PostScript output. The text and heading fonts are ITC Garamond Light and Garamond Book; the code font is Constant Willison. The illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano and Jessamyn Read using Macromedia FreeHand 9 and Adobe Photoshop 6. This colophon was written by Ann Schirmer.</p>
