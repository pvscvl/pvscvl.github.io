<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1>

<p>When I wrote the preface to the first edition of <em class="emphasis">Java &amp;
XML</em> just over a year ago, I had no idea what I was getting
into. I made jokes about XML appearing on hats and t-shirts; yet as I
sit writing this, I'm wearing a t-shirt with "XML"
emblazoned across it, and yes, I have a hat with XML on it also (in
fact, I have two!). So, the promise of XML has been recognized,
without any doubt. And that's good.
</p>

<p>However, it has meant that more development is occurring every day,
and the <a name="INDEX-1" />XML landscape is growing at a
pace I never anticipated, even in my wildest dreams. While
that's great for XML, it has made looking back at the first
edition of this book somewhat depressing; why is everything so out of
date? I talked about SAX 2.0, and DOM Level 2 as twinklings in eyes.
They are now industry standard. I introduced JDOM, and now it's
in JSR (Sun's Java<img alt="Figure 0" src="figs/U2122.gif" /> Specification Request process). I
hadn't even looked at SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, and XML data binding.
They take up three chapters in this edition! Things have changed, to
say the least.
</p>

<p>If you're even remotely suspicious that you may have to work
with XML in the next few months, this book can help. And if
you've got the first edition lying somewhere on your desk at
work right now, I invite you to browse the new one; I think
you'll see that this book is still important to you. I've
thrown out all the excessive descriptions of basic concepts,
condensed the basic XML material into a single chapter, and rewritten
nearly every example; I've also added many new examples and
chapters. In other words, I tried to make this an in-depth technical
book with lots of grit. It will take you beginners a little longer,
as I do less handholding, but you'll find the knowledge to be
gained much greater.
</p>

<div class="sect1"><a name="javaxml2-PREF-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Organization</h2>

<p>This book is structured in a very particular way: the first half of
the book, <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "Introduction"</a>
through <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "JAXP"</a>, focuses on grounding you in XML
and the core Java APIs for handling XML. For each of the three XML
manipulation APIs (SAX, DOM, and JDOM), I'll give you a chapter
on the basics, and then a chapter on more advanced concepts. <a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "Web Publishing Frameworks"</a> is a transition chapter, starting to move up
the XML "stack" a bit. It covers JAXP, which is an
abstraction layer over SAX and DOM. The remainder of the book,
<a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, "XML-RPC"</a> through <a href="ch15_01.htm">Chapter 15, "Data Binding"</a>, focuses on specific XML topics that continually
are brought up at conferences and tutorials I am involved with, and
seek to get you neck-deep in using XML in your applications. These
topics include new chapters on SOAP, data binding, and an updated
look at business-to-business. Finally, there are two appendixes to
wrap up the book. The summary of this content is as follows:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "Introduction"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
We will look at what all the hype is about, examine the XML alphabet
soup, and spend time discussing why XML is so important to the
present and future of enterprise development.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "Nuts and Bolts"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
This is a crash course in XML basics, from XML 1.0 to DTDs and XML
Schema to XSLT to Namespaces. For readers of the first edition, this
is the sum total (and then some) of all the various chapters on
working with XML.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "SAX"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
The Simple API for XML (SAX), our first Java API for handling XML, is
introduced and covered in this chapter. The parsing lifecycle is
detailed, and the events that can be caught by SAX and used by
developers are demonstrated.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "Advanced SAX "</a></i></dt>
<dd>
We'll push further with SAX in this chapter, covering less-used
but still powerful items in the API. You'll find out how to use
XML filters to chain callback behavior, use XML writers to output XML
with SAX, and look at some of the less commonly used SAX handlers
like <tt class="literal">LexicalHandler</tt> and
<tt class="literal">DeclHandler</tt>.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, "DOM"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
This chapter moves on through the XML landscape to the next Java and
XML API, the DOM (Document Object Model). You'll learn DOM
basics, find out what is in the current specification (DOM Level 2),
and how to read and write DOM trees.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, "Advanced DOM"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
Moving on through DOM, you'll learn about the various DOM
modules like Traversal, Range, Events, CSS, and HTML. We'll
also look at what the new version, DOM Level 3, offers and how to use
these new features.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "JDOM"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
This chapter introduces JDOM, and describes how it is similar to and
different from DOM and SAX. It covers reading and writing XML using
this API.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, "Advanced JDOM"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
In a closer examination of JDOM, we'll look at practical
applications of the API, how JDOM can use factories with your own
JDOM subclasses, and JAXP integration. You'll also see XPath in
action in tandem with JDOM.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "JAXP"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
Now a full-fledged API with support for parsing and transformations,
JAXP merits its own chapter. Here, we'll look at both the 1.0
and 1.1 versions, and you'll learn how to use this API to its
fullest.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, "Web Publishing Frameworks"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
This chapter looks at what a web publishing framework is, why it
matters to you, and how to choose a good one. We then cover the
Apache Cocoon framework, taking an in-depth look at its feature set
and how it can be used to serve highly dynamic content over the Web.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch11_01.htm">Chapter 11, "XML-RPC"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
In this chapter, we'll cover Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), its
relevance in distributed computing as compared to RMI, and how XML
makes RPC a viable solution for some problems. We'll then look
at using XML-RPC Java libraries and building XML-RPC clients and
servers.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch12_01.htm">Chapter 12, "SOAP"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
In this chapter, we'll look at using configuration data in an
XML format, and see why that format is so important to cross-platform
applications, particularly as it relates to distributed systems and
web services.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch13_01.htm">Chapter 13, "Web Services"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
Continuing the discussions of SOAP and web services, this chapter
details two important technologies, UDDI and WSDL.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch14_01.htm">Chapter 14, "Content Syndication"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
Continuing in the vein of business-to-business applications, this
chapter introduces another way for businesses to interoperate, using
content syndication. You'll learn about Rich Site Summary,
building information channels, and even a little Perl.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch15_01.htm">Chapter 15, "Data Binding"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
Moving up the XML "stack," this chapter covers one of the
higher-level Java and XML APIs, XML data binding. You'll learn
what data binding is, how it can make working with XML a piece of
cake, and the current offerings. I'll look at three frameworks:
Castor, Zeus, and Sun's early access release of JAXB, the Java
Architecture for XML Data Binding.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="ch16_01.htm">Chapter 16, "Looking Forward"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
This chapter points out some of the interesting things coming up over
the horizon, and lets you in on some extra knowledge on each. Some of
these guesses may be completely off; others may be the next big
thing.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="appa_01.htm">Appendix A, "API Reference"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
This appendix details all the classes, interfaces, and methods
available for use in the SAX, DOM, JAXP, and JDOM APIs.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>
<dt><i><a href="appb_01.htm">Appendix B, "SAX 2.0 Features and Properties"</a></i></dt>
<dd>
This appendix details the features and properties available to SAX
2.0 parser implementations.
</p>
</dd>
