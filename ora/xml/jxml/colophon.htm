<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>








<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>



<p>The animals on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Java &amp; XML, Second Edition</em> are lions
(<em class="emphasis">Panthera leo</em>). These great cats differ from other solitary felines in
that they form family groups, called prides. Prides consist of as many
as 30 to 40 lions, most of which are females and their offspring. The
lifespan of a lion is approximately 3-4 years. Full grown males can
grow up to 10 feet in length; the only cat larger is the tiger. The
lion's eye is particularly sensitive to movement, and it can detect
the movement of its prey from a great distance. Special receptor cells
in the cat's eye give it exceptional night vision.</p>


<p>Lions live in eastern and southern Africa, although some
subspecies of the African lion are endangered. The Asiatic lion
(<em class="emphasis">P.l. persica</em>) once lived throughout India, the Middle East, and
Southern Asia. Today, its population has been reduced to approximately
290 animals, which can be found in the Gir Forest National Park in
Gujarat, western India. The Barbary and Cape lions are extinct.</p>



<p>Lions are carnivores and prey on large herd animals. They are at
the top of the food chain, the apex predator of their environment.
The females are the hunters, while the males' role is to protect the
pride from other aggressive males. Lions are not as fast as other big
cats, such as the cheetah. As a result, they concentrate on heavier,
less agile animals, and hunt from ambush by driving prey toward
concealed members of the hunting group. They use coordinated,
cooperative techniques that enable the group to hunt with more success
than an individual could. African lions eat wildebeest, zebra,
antelope, gazelle, impala, and giraffe.</p>


<p>Colleen Gorman was the production editor and copyeditor for <em class="citetitle">Java
&amp; XML, Second Edition</em>. Emily Quill was the proofreader, and Catherine
Morris and Jane Ellin provided quality control. John Bickelhaupt wrote
the index.</p>


<p>Ellie Volckhausen designed the cover of this book, based on a
series design by Edie Freedman.  The cover image is a 19th-century
engraving from Grosvenor Prints in London. Emma Colby produced the
cover layout with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond
font.</p>

 
<p>Melanie Wang designed the interior layout, based on a series design by Nancy Priest. The heading font is Bitstream Bodoni, the text font is ITC New Baskerville, and the code font is Constant Willison. Neil Walls and Anne-Marie Vaduva converted the files from Microsoft Word to FrameMaker 5.5.6 using tools created by Mike Sierra. The illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Jessamyn Read and Rob Romano using Macromedia FreeHand 9 and Adobe Photoshop 6.</p>
