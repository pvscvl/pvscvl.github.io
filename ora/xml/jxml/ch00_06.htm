<h2 class="sect1">0.6. Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Well, here I am writing acknowledgments again. It's no easier
to remember everybody this time than it was the first. My editor,
Mike Loukides, keeps me up at night stressing out about getting
things done, which is exactly what a good editor does! Kyle Hart,
marketing superwoman, keeps things going and reminds me that
there's light at the end of the tunnel. Tim O'Reilly and
Frank Willison are patient, yet pushy, just what good bosses should
be. And Bob Eckstein and Marc Loy were there for me for pesky Swing
GUI problems. (Besides, Bob's just funny. Face it.)
O'Reilly is as good as it gets, all around. I'm honored
to be associated with them.
</p>

<p>I also want to think the incredible team of reviewers for this book.
Many times, these folks turned a chapter around in less than 24
hours, yet still managed to give honest technical feedback. These
guys are a large part of why this book stayed technical. Robert Sese,
Philip Nelson, and Victor Brilon, you guys are amazing. Of course,
I've always got to thank my partner in crime, Jason Hunter, for
being annoyingly dedicated to JDOM and other technical issues (take a
night off, man!). Finally, my company, Lutris Technologies, is about
as good a place as you could hope to work for. They let me work long
hours on this book, with never a complaint. In particular, Yancy
Lind, Paul Morgan, David Young, and Keith Bigelow are simply the best
at what they do. Thanks, guys!
</p>

<p>To my parents, Larry and Judy McLaughlin, thanks again. I love you
both for putting up with your rather ambitious and driven son (you
realize, of course, those characteristics also make for a terribly
obnoxious child!). Sarah Jane, my aunt, and my grandparents, Dean and
Gladys McLaughlin, don't ever think that because I don't
see you often I don't think about you all the time. Granddad,
I'm more thankful than you'll ever know that you're
getting to see a second edition. I love you all.
</p>

<p>To my second set of parents (my wife's folks), Gary and Shirley
Greathouse, you're just the best. One day I'll learn to
take these writing skills and explain what you both mean to me, but
it might take a whole book on its own. I love you both, for your
humor and your wisdom. To Quinn and Joni for providing such levity at
Sunday lunches. To Lonnie and Laura, can't wait to see Baby J.
To Bill and Terri for being friends, and very wise ones at that, and
to Bill for being a pastor like no other.
</p>

<p>The laughter in my life comes from several hilarious characters, and
I just can't pass up mentioning them here: Kendra, Brittany,
Lisette, Janay, Rocky, Dustin, Tony, Stephanie, Robbie, Erin, Angela,
Mike, Matt, Carlos, and John. I'll see you all Sunday, and can
we please stop going to Mazzio's? And to the nonhuman part of
my life, my dogs: Seth, Charlie, Jake, Moses, Molly, and Daisy. You
haven't lived until the cold tongue of a basset hound wakes you
up in the morning.
</p>

<p>Finally, to the two people that mean more to me than anyone; my
grandfather, Robert Earl Burden, who one day I'll see again. I
think about you every day, and my children will hear about you soon.
Most of all, to my wife, Leigh. Words just don't cut it. One
day all the songs and tears that have come to me because of what you
mean to me will come out, and you'll finally understand how
much you mean to me.
</p>

<p>And to the Lord who got me this far. Even so, come Lord
Jesus.<a name="INDEX-7" /><a name="INDEX-8" /><a name="INDEX-9" /><a name="INDEX-10" /><a name="INDEX-11" /><a name="INDEX-12" /><a name="INDEX-13" /><a name="INDEX-14" /><a name="INDEX-15" /><a name="INDEX-16" />
