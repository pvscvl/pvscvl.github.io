<h2 class="sect1">0.2. Who Should Read This Book?</h2>

<p>This book is based on the premise that XML is quickly becoming (and
to some extent has already become) an essential part of Java
programming. The chapters instruct you in the use of XML and Java,
and other than in <a href="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, "Introduction"</a>, they do not focus on
<em class="emphasis">if</em> you should use XML. If you are
a Java developer, you should use XML, without question. For this
reason, if you are a Java programmer, want to be a Java programmer,
manage Java programmers, or are associated with a Java project, this
book is for you. If you want to advance, become a better developer,
write cleaner code, or have projects succeed on time and under
budget; if you need to access legacy data, need to distribute system
components, or just want to know what the XML hype is about, this
book is for you.
</p>

<p>I tried to make as few assumptions about you as possible; I
don't believe in setting the entry point for XML so high that
it is impossible to get started. However, I also believe that if you
spent your money on this book, you want more than the basics. For
this reason, I only assumed that you know the Java language and
understand some server-side programming concepts (such as Java
servlets and Enterprise JavaBeans). If you have never coded Java
before or are just getting started with the language, you may want to
read <em class="emphasis">Learning Java</em> by Pat
Niemeyer and Jonathan Knudsen (O'Reilly) before starting this
book. I do not assume that you know anything about XML, and start
with the basics. However, I do assume that you are willing to work
hard and learn quickly; for this reason we move rapidly through the
basics so that the bulk of the book can deal with advanced concepts.
Material is not repeated unless appropriate, so you may need to
reread previous sections or flip back and forth as we use previously
covered concepts in later chapters. If you know some Java, want to
learn XML, and are prepared to enter some example code into your
favorite editor, you should be able to get through this book without
any real problem.
