<h2 class="sect1">7.4. Is JDOM a Standard?</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-762" />More
than any other question about JDOM, I am asked whether JDOM is a
standard. This is a common question, especially among either those
who want to use JDOM (and need justification) or those who
don't like JDOM (and need justification). I address some of
those issues in this section, so that whatever camp you are in, you
know the details about JDOM and its standardization process.
</p>

<a name="javaxml2-CHP-7-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">7.4.1. JDOM as a JSR</h3>

<p>First and foremost, JDOM is now an official <a name="INDEX-763" />JSR, which is a
Java Specification Request. In other words, it is going through the
formal standardization process, sponsored by Sun and governed by the
<a name="INDEX-764" />JCP (the Java Community Process). You
can read all about the JSR and JCP processes at
<a name="INDEX-765" /><a href="../../../../../../java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/">http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/</a>.
As for JDOM, it is now officially JSR-102 and can be found online at
Sun's web site, located at <a href="../../../../../../java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/jsr_102_jdom.html">http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/jsr_102_jdom.html</a>.
</p>

<p>Once JDOM moves through the JCP, probably in late 2001, several
things will happen. First, it will receive a much more elevated
status in terms of standards; although the JCP and Sun aren't
perfect, they do offer a lot of credence. The JCP has support and
members within IBM, BEA, Compaq, HP, Apache, and more. Additionally,
it will become very easy to move JDOM into other Java standards. For
example, there is interest from Sun in making JDOM part of the next
version of JAXP, either 1.2 or 2.0 (I talk more about JAXP in <a href="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, "JAXP"</a>). Finally, future versions of the JDK are
slated to have XML as part of their core; in years to come, JDOM may
be in every download of Java.

<h3 class="sect2">7.4.2. SAX and DOM as Standards</h3>

<p><a name="INDEX-766" />
<a name="INDEX-767" />Keep
in mind that JDOM isn't getting some sort of elevated status;
DOM and SAX are already both a part of JAXP, and so are actually
<em class="emphasis">ahead</em> of JDOM in that regard. However,
it's worth making some comments about the
"standardization" of DOM and SAX. First, SAX came out of
the public domain, and remains today a de facto standard. Developed
primarily on the XML-dev mailing list, no standards body ratified or
accepted SAX until it was already in heavy use. While I am by no
means criticizing SAX, I am wary of folks who claim that JDOM
shouldn't be used because it wasn't developed by a
standards body.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, DOM was developed by the W3C, and is a formal
standard. For that reason, it has a staunch following. DOM is a great
solution for many applications. Again, though, the W3C is simply one
standards body; the JCP is another, the IETF is yet another, and so
on. I'm not arguing the merits of any particular group; I just
caution you about accepting <em class="emphasis">any</em> standard (JDOM
or otherwise) if it doesn't meet your application's
needs. Arguments about "standardization" take a backseat
to usability. If you like DOM and it serves your needs, then use it.
The same goes for SAX and JDOM. What I would prefer that everybody
do, though, is stop trying to make decisions for everyone else (and I
know I'm defending my API, but I get this sort of thing all the
time!). Hopefully, this book takes you deeply enough into all three
APIs to help you make an educated decision.
