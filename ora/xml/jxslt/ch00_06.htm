<h2 class="sect1">0.6. Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>I would like to thank my wife Jennifer for tolerating my absence
during the past six months, as I have locked myself in the basement
researching, writing, and thinking. I also feel fortunate that my
two-year-old son Aidan goes to bed early; a vast majority of this
book was written well after 8:30 P.M.!
</p>

<p>Coming up with a list of people to thank is a difficult job because
so many have influenced the material in this book. I only hope that I
do not leave anyone out. All of the technical reviewers did an
amazing amount of work, each offering a unique perspective and useful
advice. The official reviewers were Dean Wette, Kevin Heifner, Paul
Jensen, Shane Curcuru, and Tim Brown.
</p>

<p>I would also like to thank Weiqi Gao, Shu Zhu, Santosh Shanbhag, and
Suman Ganesh for help with the internationalization example in <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, "Additional Techniques"</a>. A technical article by Dan Troesser inspired
my servlet filter implementation, and Justin Michel and Brent Roberts
reviewed some of the first chapters that I wrote.
</p>

<p>There are two companies that I really want to thank. O'Reilly
has this little link on their home page called "Write for
Us." This book came into existence because I casually clicked
on that link one day and decided to submit a proposal. Although my
original idea was not accepted, Mike Loukides and I exchanged several
emails after that in a virtual brainstorming session, and eventually
the proposal for this book emerged. I am still amazed that an unknown
visitor to a web site can become an O'Reilly author.
</p>

<p>The other company I would like to thank is Object Computing, Inc.
(OCI), my employer. They have a remarkable group of highly talented
software engineers, all of whom are always available to answer
questions, offer advice, and inspire me to learn more. These people
are the reason I work for OCI and are the reason this book was
possible.
</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to thank Mark Volkmann of OCI for teaching me
about XML in the first place and for answering countless questions
during the past five years.<a name="INDEX-16" /><a name="INDEX-17" /><a name="INDEX-18" /><a name="INDEX-19" /><a name="INDEX-20" /><a name="INDEX-21" /><a name="INDEX-22" /><a name="INDEX-23" /><a name="INDEX-24" /><a name="INDEX-25" /><a name="INDEX-26" /><a name="INDEX-27" />
