<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1>




<p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>


<p>The animals on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Java and XSLT</em> are ermines, also
known as stoats or short-tailed weasels. <em class="emphasis">Mustela erminea</em> are found
around the world between the Arctic Circle and approximately
40 degrees north latitude. Their body length, not including tail,
ranges from 7 to 12 inches, with proportionately sized tails from 3 to
6 inches long. They weigh between 1.5 and 11.5 ounces. Males are, on
average, larger than females.</p>


<p>Ermines can both swim and climb trees, and though they live in
such diverse habitats as grasslands, tundra, and deep forests, they
tend to prefer rocky or brushy areas. They are carnivores and eat
mostly rodents, but they also enjoy small rabbits and birds, fish,
bugs, and eggs. (Whether they take their eggs sunny-side-up or
over-easy is still a matter of great debate.)</p>


<p>Female ermines give birth to only one litter per year. The
mating season is in the late spring, but after fertilization, the
ermine embryos stop developing and do not implant in the uterus for
several months. Once implantation occurs, gestation takes only about a
month, and the babies are born in the spring of the year following
fertilization. </p>

<p>Ermines can live up to eight years, but their lifespan in the
wild tends to be only a year or less. Their main killer is starvation,
dependent as they are on fluctuating rodent populations, but they are
also preyed upon by hawks, owls, and humans.</p>


<p>Ermine fur, which is harvested from both <em class="emphasis">M. erminea</em> and its
cousin, <em class="emphasis">M. frenata</em>, the long-tailed weasel, is specifically the fur of
an ermine in winter. At this time of year, their fur is stark white
except for a small black tip on the tail, leading to the
black-flecked, white-fur robes favored by stylish monarchs all over
the world.</p>

<p>Matt Hutchinson was the production editor and copyeditor for
<em class="citetitle">Java and XSLT</em>.  Susan Carlson Greene proofread the book, and Leanne
Soylemez and Emily Quill provided quality control. John Bickelhaupt
wrote the index. James Carter provided production assistance.</p>


<p>Ellie Volckhausen designed the cover of this book, based on a
series design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is a 19th-century
engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Emma Colby produced the
cover layout with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond
font.</p>
  
<p>David Futato designed the interior layout, based on a series design by Nancy Priest. Neil Walls converted the files from Microsoft Word to FrameMaker 5.5.6 using tools created by Mike Sierra. The heading font is Bitstream Bodoni, the text font is ITC New Baskerville, and the code font is Constant Willison. The illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano and Jessamyn Read using Macromedia FreeHand 9 and Adobe Photoshop 6. This colophon was written by Leanne Soylemez.</p>
