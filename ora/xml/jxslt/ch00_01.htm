<h1 class="chapter">Preface</h1><p><a name="INDEX-1" />Java and Extensible Stylesheet
Language Transformations (XSLT) are very different technologies that
complement one another, rather than compete. Java's strengths
are portability, its vast collection of standard libraries, and
widespread acceptance by most companies. One weakness of Java,
however, is in its ability to process text. For instance, Java may
not be the best technology for merely converting XML files into
another format such as XHTML or Wireless Markup Language (WML). Using
Java for such a task requires skilled programmers who understand APIs
such as DOM, SAX, or JDOM. For web sites in particular, it is
desirable to simplify the page generation process so nonprogrammers
can participate.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-2" />XSLT is explicitly designed for
<a name="INDEX-3" />XML transformations. With XSLT, XML data
can be transformed into any other text format, including HTML, XHTML,
WML, and even unexpected formats such as Java source code. In terms
of complexity and sophistication, XSLT is harder than HTML but easier
than Java. This means that page authors can probably learn how to use
XSLT successfully but will require assistance from programmers as
pages are developed.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-4" />
<a name="INDEX-5" />XSLT
processors are required to interpret and execute the instructions
found in XSLT stylesheets. Many of these processors are written in
<a name="INDEX-6" />Java, making Java an excellent choice for
applications that must interoperate with XML and XSLT. For web sites
that utilize XSLT, Java servlets and EJBs are still required to
intercept client requests, fetch data from databases, and implement
business logic. XSLT may be used to generate each of the XHTML web
pages, but this cannot be done without a language like Java acting as
the coordinator.
</p>

<p>This book explains the most important concepts behind the XSLT markup
language but is not a comprehensive reference on that subject.
Instead, the focus is on interoperability with Java, with particular
emphasis on servlets and web applications. Every concept is backed by
working examples, all of which work on widely available, free tools.

<h2 class="sect1">0.1. Audience</h2>

<p>Java programmers who want to learn how to use XSLT comprise the
target audience for this book. Java programming experience is
essential, and basic familiarity with XML terminology is helpful, but
not required. Since so many of the examples revolve around web
applications and servlets, <a href="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, "Java-Based Web Technologies"</a> and
6 are devoted to this topic, offering a fast-paced tutorial to
servlet technology. <a href="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, "XSLT Part 1 -- The Basics"</a> and <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "XSLT Part 2 -- Beyond the Basics"</a> contain a detailed XSLT tutorial, so no prior
knowledge of XSLT is required.
</p>

<p>This book is particularly well-suited for readers who may have read a
lot about these technologies but have not used everything together in
a complete application. <a href="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, "Discussion Forum"</a>, for example,
presents the implementation of a web-based discussion forum from
start to finish. Fully worked examples can be found in every chapter,
ranging from an Ant build file documentation stylesheet in <a href="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, "XSLT Part 2 -- Beyond the Basics"</a> to internationalization techniques in <a href="ch08_01.htm">Chapter 8, "Additional Techniques"</a>.
