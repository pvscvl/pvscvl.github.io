<h2 class="sect1">1.5. Web Browser Support for XSLT</h2>

<p><a name="INDEX-163" />In a
<a name="INDEX-164" />web application environment,
performing XSLT
<a name="INDEX-165" />transformations
on the client instead of the server is valuable for a number of
reasons. Most importantly, it reduces the workload on the server
machine, allowing a greater number of clients to be served. Once a
stylesheet is downloaded to the client, subsequent requests will
presumably use a cached copy, therefore only the raw XML data will
need to be transmitted with each request. This has the potential to
greatly reduce bandwidth requirements.
</p>

<p>Even more interesting tricks are possible when JavaScript is
introduced into the equation. You can programmatically modify either
the XML data or the XSLT stylesheet on the client side, reapply the
stylesheet, and see the results immediately without requesting a new
document from the server.
</p>

<p><a name="INDEX-166" />Microsoft introduced XSLT support into
Version 5.0 of Internet Explorer, but the XSLT specification was not
finalized at the time. Unfortunately, significant changes were made
to XSLT before it was finally promoted to a W3C Recommendation, but
IE had already shipped using the older version of the specification.
Although Microsoft has done a good job updating its
<a name="INDEX-167" /> <a name="INDEX-168" />MSXML parser with full support for the
final XSLT Recommendation, millions of users will probably stick to
IE 5.0 or 5.5 for quite some time, making it very difficult to
perform portable XSLT
<a name="INDEX-169" />transformations on the
client. For IE 5.0 or 5.5 users, the MSXML parser is available as a
separate download from Microsoft. Once downloaded, installed, and
configured using a separate program called
<em class="filename">xmlinst</em>, the browser will be compliant with
Version 1.0 of the XSLT recommendation. This is something that
developers will want to do, but probably very few end users will have
the technical skills to go through these steps.
</p>

<p>At the time of this writing,
<a name="INDEX-170" /> <a name="INDEX-171" />Netscape had not introduced support
for XSLT into its browsers. We hope this changes by the time this
book is published. Although their implementation will be released
much later than Microsoft's, it should be compliant with the
latest XSLT Recommendation.
</p>

<p>Yet another alternative is to utilize a browser plug-in that supports
XSLT, although this approach is probably most effective within the
confines of a corporation. In this environment, the browser can be
controlled to a certain extent, allowing client-side transformations
much sooner than possible on public web sites.
</p>

<p>Because XSLT transformation on the client will likely be mired in
browser compatibility issues for several years, the role of Java with
respect to XSLT will continue to be important. One use will be to
detect the browser using a Java servlet, and then deliver the
appropriate stylesheet to the client only if a compliant browser is
in use. Otherwise, the servlet will drive the transformation process
by invoking the XSLT processor on the web server. Once we finish with
XSLT syntax in the next two chapters, the role of Java and XSLT will
be covered throughout the remainder of this book.
