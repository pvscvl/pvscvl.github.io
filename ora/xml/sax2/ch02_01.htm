        SAX gets its power from the unifying
	notion that sequences of event callbacks are powerful and
	lightweight ways to represent the information in XML documents.
	Building on that notion, you can create many powerful tools.
	Most of the essential SAX calls use interfaces, so the interesting
	behavior comes from how you combine implementations of those
	interfaces to assemble tools and what those implementations do.
	</p>

	<p>This chapter shows the basic structure of SAX and of
	several classic SAX applications using an XML parser,
	the "simple" core of SAX.
	It starts by showing the essential components and the framework
	through which they relate.
	Then it shows how to customize the most important features and
	concepts in that framework and how to work with the core
	XML data model of elements, attributes, and text.
	You'll also see how to handle errors and learn how
	SAX exposes XML namespaces.
	</p>
	<p>This chapter focuses on the parts of SAX that essentially
	every application needs to know. It doesn't provide full
	information about every interface.
	Later chapters elaborate on these structures and concepts,
	showing additional parts of these APIs,
	ways to combine SAX components, and
	how to work with additional parts of the XML data model.
	Depending on what your application needs to do, you may
	not need to know much more of SAX than is explained in
	this chapter.

        The first thing to learn is that there are really two kinds
	of roles in this API -- or three, if you include your role as
	director, configuring sets of components to serve those roles
	and provide your application's functionality.
	Complete SAX applications integrate all these roles.
	</p>

	<p>The first role is an event
	<em class="emphasis">producer</em>,
	which is typically an XML parser packaged as an instance
	of some library class.
	The producer is in charge of pushing parsing events to objects
	that serve the second role: an event <em class="emphasis">consumer</em>.
	Most SAX applications will only have one event producer,
	though we'll look at some cases where you need
	more than one.
	This chapter touches on several of the ways to configure (or
	customize) event producers.
	</p>

        Consumers normally do most of the
	"real" work for any given SAX-based application:
	they make sense of the parsing events
	and often create some specialized data structures.
	Without a consumer to handle events, nothing happens!
	SAX2 defines several
	kinds of <em class="emphasis">handlers</em> to consume different
	parts of the XML content.
	Later chapters look at each kind of handler in detail, but
	in this chapter we look only at the most important methods
	and handlers.
	</p>

	<p>When we show SAX components connecting, we'll use
	diagrams like <a href="ch02_01.htm">Figure 2-1</a>,
	with the dashed lines indicating
	individual event handlers.
	There are four of them because there are four handlers
	used to deliver content to consumers.
	The producer uses a big arrow, which should remind
	you in which direction it pushes events.
	</p>

	<p>When you're using SAX, any or all of these components
	can be provided by your application or can be library
	components. Often you'll use an XML parser from a library
	to produce events, but in other cases applications produce
	such events directly.
